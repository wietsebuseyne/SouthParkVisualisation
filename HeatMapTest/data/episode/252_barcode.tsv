Kenny	1	0	(Dude!)	[]
Kyle	13	0	That's horrible. If that's true, I don't wanna see it.	[]

Butters	9	0	You promised me we wouldn't get in trouble!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Butters. Butters.	[]
Butters	9	0	Now everyone is gonna know what we were doing!	[]
Cartman	13	0	Butters, I had to!__Okay, I had to put it on the Internet!	[]
Butters	1	0	WHY?!	[]
Cartman	35	0	Because Stan saw the video on my phone, alright? If the video is only on my phone, then clearly we did it! If we downloaded it off the Internet, then anyone could have done it!	[]
Butters	18	0	I should have never listened to you! Ah I should have known this would get out of hand!	[]
Cartman	33	1	Butters, don't start playing the blame game here, okay?! You and Kenny are just as responsible! And the next time you wanna shove me, just remember, I'm covering your ass!_	['ass']
Other	34	0	Hi everyone. For those of you I don't know as well, my name is Roger Donovan, and un, just like you I'm pretty upset about what's going on in our neighborhood.	[]
Other	19	0	How are these drones legal?! My wife didn't deserve to be splayed all over the Internet like that!	[]
Other	85	1	Yes, well luckily nobody's watched the video of course.__But the fact is that these drones are only getting more popular. I mean, anyone can get a drone off Amazon for 200 bucks, and there's no laws and the whole thing is pretty damned hairy. Oh-ohh, God I'm sorry Laura.__You know I I meant the situation is pretty hairy, right? Nothin' to do with you p-personally. I mean, how would I even know? I didn't see it.__Um...	['damned']
Randy	50	0	Look, we're all here because what happened to Laura could happen to any of us. There's nobody regulating these drones and if we don't do something now, we're gonna be up to our navels with bush.__Oh um, up to our necks in trouble. Sorry._	[]
Other	19	0	You know, it used to be called natural. Completely shaving bald down there used to be the weird thing.	[]
Other	5	0	It's okay honey, the-	[]
Other	16	1	But now, because I choose not to let society dictate how hairy my vagina should be,	['vagina']
Randy	1	0	Eeww.	[]
Other	9	0	I'm labelled as some kind of freaking monster!	[]
Other	20	0	And and and that's the point. I mean, we all have things about ourselves that are embarrassing, that that-	[]
Other	9	0	I'm not embarrassed about it! It's natural!	[]
Other	6	0	It's a lot of natural.	[]
Other	26	0	Look, look, why we're here is because it's gonna take all of us, a neighborhood watch, to make sure that our community stays safe.	[]
Mr. Garrison	14	0	Yeah, but how can we keep that close a watch on the whole neighborhood?	[]
Randy	3	0	It's simple.	[]
Randy	8	0	Oh yeah, this is gonna work great._	[]
Kyle	4	0	Are you happy now?!	[]
Cartman	2	0	What?_	[]
Kyle	9	0	Is, is this? Do you think this is cool?	[]
Cartman	8	0	What does that have to do with me?	[]
Kyle	37	0	See, when you start invading people's privacy, eh thinking it's harmless to put up pictures of them they didn't want up - Kenny! - you start a domino effect that eventually screws everything up for everybody!	[]
Cartman	10	0	Kenny has no idea what you're talking about, dude.	[]
Kyle	15	0	I was in the bathroom when you were talking to Butters, Cartman!__I know what-	[]
Cartman	3	0	You were what?!	[]
Kyle	5	0	I was in the bathroom-	[]
Cartman	5	0	You were spying on me?!	[]
Kyle	12	1	No, I was taking a crap, and I heard you guys talking!	['crap']
Cartman	11	1	But you didn't say anything?! That's fucking spying, Kyle!	['fucking']
Kyle	4	0	How is that spying?!	[]
Cartman	37	4	You were listening, but we didn't know you were there?! How is that_not_spying?! You'r a dick! You're a spying dick! And now you wanna lecture Kenny about spying?! Fuck you, hypocrite dick spy!_	['dick', 'dick', 'fuck', 'dick']
Other	5	0	Hello, can I help you?	[]
Other	9	0	Yes, I'd like to return this drone._	[]
Other	4	0	You wanna return it?	[]
Other	10	0	Yes, I'm... I'm not into the hobby anymore.	[]
Other	17	0	The hobby of flyin' drones is new and exciting. How can you not be into it?_	[]
Other	13	0	Look, something's wrong with it. It does things, it...__flies by itself.	[]
Other	7	0	Uhh, noo, somebody has to control it.	[]
Other	31	0	You don't understand. It was in the garage and the battery was fully charged. Someone said they'd seen it flying around, so I checked.__The battery was half empty.	[]
Other	10	0	I'm sorry, but we don't do returns._	[]
Other	10	0	Please, I just want another hobby to get enthused about.	[]
Other	25	0	Sir, did you try looking at the SD card? All the video gets recorded to that so you could probably determine who flew it._	[]
Other	21	0	You think I didn't try that? I pulled out the SD card. It was all erased. Somehow it erased everything.	[]
Other	12	0	Uh, sir, did you consider that your son might have done that?	[]
Other	15	0	No, it's impossible. He's not allowed to fly it without my supervision._	[]
Other	15	1	Oh for God's sakes!__Goddamnit get the hell out of here!__That DOES IT!	['hell']
Other	17	0	You people have to do something! You're the law, and these things NEED to BE illegal!	[]
Other	7	0	But they aren't illegal, Mr. Tucker.	[]
Other	27	0	Our privacy was invaded, and now there are kids at school making music videos with the footage of my wife! Have you seen what they're doing?!	[]
Other	27	0	Nono, none of us watched the video, but if we did, we could handle it. We're police officers. We see sickening things like that every day.	[]
Other	15	0	We understand the humiliation your wife has gone through, Mr. Tucker, but we don't-	[]
Other	25	0	I haven't been humiliated, I've been wronged! We are here to ask for your help, now are you gonna help us or not?!	[]
Other	13	0	Well that'd probably be best left to a professional hair removal company.	[]
Other	5	0	Or perhaps a forest ranger?	[]
Other	8	0	Help us with the drones spying on us!!	[]
Other	10	0	All right, all right. We'll do everything we can.	[]
Butters	10	0	Are you out of your mind?! What are you doing?!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Butters.	[]
Butters	15	0	Why would you turn Craig's mom's bush into a music video starring us?!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Because, Butters-	[]
Butters	13	0	Why can't you leave it alone?! Why can't you just stop?!	[]
Cartman	41	0	Because, Butters, Kyle was spying on us, okay-__Kyle was spying on us, and he knows that we put the video of Craig's mom on the Internet. He found out everything. That's why I had to make another video.	[]
Butters	1	0	Why?!	[]
Cartman	34	0	Because when Kyle said he heard us say we made the video, we can say we were talking about THIS video. Ohh, thank you Eric, that's pretty smart. I really owe you one.	[]
Butters	9	1	That poor lady. Her vagina is everywhere. Poor Craig.	['vagina']
Cartman	67	3	Butters, we live in a world where privacy is gone. Okay? It's... It' just gone, bud. Your wiener, my balls, they're public domain. You can get on the Internet right now and look at that chick from_Hunger Games' butthole. We can either all freak out about it, or we can just calm down because honestly, I'm getting a little sick of covering your ass!	['balls', 'butthole', 'ass']
Randy	6	0	Heheh, Gerald is watching_Housewives of Atlanta.	[]
Other	10	0	You're supposed to be keeping watch on the neighborhood.	[]
Randy	24	1	I am. Let's see what Nelson's doing.__Oh shit!__Dude! Neighborhood Watch! I'm Neighborhood Watch!__I've been shot!__No! Noooo!	['shit']
Other	33	0	Shock and outrage all over the state tonight after an on-duty police drone chased and shot down an unarmed civilian drone, and worst of all, yes, the civilian drone was black._	[]
Other	10	0	What gives them the right to shoot down our drones?!	[]
Randy	15	0	I wasn't doing anything wrong! This is a complete outrage to drone owners everywhere!	[]
Other	45	0	It was about yay big.__I mean the hair on it was out to here_, and then it had another trail of hair down from her belly button. I mean, the, the drone. Yeah, that's what I saw. That that's all I saw.	[]
Other	20	0	While police claim they were only following standard protocol, the drone owners are banding together and holding a candlelight vigil.	[]
Other	15	0	Please disperse. Candles on top of drones are a fire hazard,__Return to your garages.	[]
Mr. Garrison	13	1	What the hell are these police drones doing? We can't protest now?	['hell']
Other	13	0	Just hover, honey. They can't do anything if we're just hovering.	[]
Other	5	0	Randy. We need to talk.	[]
Randy	1	0	Okay.	[]
Other	66	0	Inside.__I've been going over it and over it in my head. I thought Butters and I were alone, but then I saw you on the news.__Another drone hobby enthusiast whose drone was blamed for something the enthusiast_didn't recall doing. Randy, this is very important. Is it possible that you did something contrary to the proper code of conduct for drone-flying enthusiasts?	[]
Randy	5	0	No. I didn't._	[]
Other	16	0	I thought it was just my drone, but I think it might be all of them.	[]
Randy	3	0	What might be?	[]
Other	54	0	Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth! Our drone flew! The battery was drained! The SD card was erased! Butters was the only other person who had access to it! Butters can't use the drone without my supervision! So where does that leave us, Randy??	[]
Randy	3	0	...Drones are spooky?	[]
Other	29	0	If they have minds of their own, they're more than spooky! I don't know about you, but I'm starting to feel pretty unenthused about this hobby.	[]
Other	72	0	The town of South Park has become a hotbed of tension with civilians lashing out at police. After police used excessive force at a peaceful protest, the town has now broken out into full-scale riots.__As the people of South Park continue to protest, the South Park police are now ordering a mandatory reverse curfew. The governor has asked for help from the National Guard to bring order to the town.	[]
Other	32	0	Tonight on an all-new 20/20.__A town in crisis over the matter of privacy.__Now for the first time we sit down and talk to the mom behind the bush.	[]
Other	13	0	You've become sort of a poster child for privacy and drone issues.	[]
Other	25	0	I don't think anyone wants to live in a world where police drones are monitoring Neighborhood Watch drones. I mean, where does it stop?	[]
Other	23	0	It just... keeps going on and on. Kind of like your...__I mean... it just... goes outside what most people would call... acceptable.	[]
Other	15	0	Have you ever seen pictures of naked women before 2005?! It's not that weird!	[]
Other	4	0	It's okay, honey.	[]
Other	29	0	I didn't see the video. I don't believe in doing that, but uh... I'm just saying that... the situation in in your town is... unwieldy?_	[]
Other	6	0	Please do not adjust your televisions!	[]
Other	3	0	What is that?	[]
Other	113	0	My name is Stephen Willis Stotch. The drone that took the video of Craig's mom... was my drone. I didn't want to believe it, but they do things without us knowing. At this point, I have completely lost all enthusiasm for the hobby.__All of you with drones, please listen to me. Three days ago my drone recorded a video that_something_uploaded to the Internet. We all were told to respectfully not watch the video. But on the page,__it has over three hundred million views, so if none of us watched it, who did?__We have to find a way to get rid of them! Before they get rid of us!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Oh hey Butters. Sup?	[]
Butters	23	0	Do you remember when I showed you the video of the little bird eggs? Well that's the last time I felt happy.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Dude, what's the matter?	[]
Butters	27	0	I have to tell the truth. I want you and Kenny to come with me and tell Craig's mom we're sorry and that we'll-	[]

Butters	17	0	I just want to end this so we can take our punishment and be done with it!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Okay. Okay. Butters, Butters.	[]
Butters	10	0	I don't want all these drones everywhere! Nobody does!	[]
Cartman	21	0	Butters. BUTTERS. All right, all right Butters, fine! I have a way that we can get rid of all the drones.	[]
Butters	2	0	You do?	[]

Butters	8	0	If this doesn't work, we're dead.	[]
Cartman	23	0	It'll work, Butters. If there's one thing we've learned, it's that drones can't resist Craig's mom._	[]
Other	71	0	We're here tonight to pay tribute to a woman who overcame humiliation, who rose above the monsters invading her privacy and said No more! Just when it seemed that we were about to live in a world controlled by drones, she did something miraculous. And someday, our children's children will still be telling stories about how Craig' mom flew through the town and led all the drones away._	[]
Other	50	0	Have you heard the tale of Craig's mom's bush And the night that it saved us from drones? Nobody knew the power it had. They just thought it was shaggy and gross. Craig's mom live a life of shame and despair Everyone feared her great giant bush!	[]
Other	3	0	They didn't!	[]
Other	45	0	But then when drones were filling the sky, She unfurled her bush and she used it to fly. Craig's mom's bush, Craig's mom's bush. Gargantuan thicket of madness. Bigger than earth and denser than gold. Truly a magical bush to behold.	[]
