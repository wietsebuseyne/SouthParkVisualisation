Other	20	0	And so, class, that is when Joe Lee countered back to Aniston and said things like-  Oh hello, Mr. Mackey.	[]
Mr. Mackey	45	0	All the girls go out in the hall please? I need to speak with the boys of this class, m'kay?  Boys, we have a very serious problem! I've just come from the men's restroom, and somebody went number 2 in the urinal!	[]
Butters	4	0	What's a urinal?	[]
Stan	6	0	A wall toilet for peeing in.	[]
Mr. Mackey	30	1	And some jokester took a poop in it! Okay? Now I want whoever did it to come forward right now, and it will be less painful for everybody! M'kay?!	['poop']
Other	16	0	Who would take a d-dump in a urinal? It's such a s-senseless crime.	[]
Cartman	20	0	Mr. Mackey, I think you might want to entertain that this is some kind of conspiracy, just like 9/11.	[]
Kyle	13	0	Oh God, here we go again! 9/11 was not a conspiracy, fatass!	[]
Cartman	11	0	Oh really?! Do you just believe everything you're told, Kyle?	[]
Mr. Mackey	52	0	Excuse me!! Could we get back to the issue, please?! You all don't seem to understand how serious this is!! Now who made dookie in the urinal?!  Oh, you think it's funny, huh?! M'kay! M'kay! You're gonna think it's real funny when the police get here!	[]
Other	16	0	I'm sorry, Mr. Mackey, but there just isn't really any evidence to go on.	[]
Mr. Mackey	17	0	But there must have been some motive. Nobody would just dook in the urinal for no reason.	[]
Other	28	1	But who would benefit from crapping in the urinal? Uh this is too big a mystery for me. I think we'd better call in the Hardly Boys.	['crapping']
Other	22	1	The Hardly Boys. Two young whippersnappers with a knack for solving mysteries. The Hardly Boys in:  The Mystery of the Urinal Turd.	['turd']
Other	17	0	So, that's it, Hardly Boys, we've got no leads and nobody admitting to the crime.	[]
Other	5	0	That sure is a mystery.	[]
Other	5	0	Yeah, it sounds super-hard.	[]
Other	19	0	Whoever did it must have been angry with the school. Oh... Oooo... I think I'm getting a clue.	[]
Other	2	0	F-really?	[]
Other	10	0	Yeah, this is totally giving me a clue right now.	[]
Other	9	0	Oh... I'm starting to get a clue too.	[]
Other	8	0	My clue is kind of pointing this way.	[]
Other	9	0	Ohhgh. Yeah, now I've got a total clue.	[]
Other	7	0	I've still got a raging clue.	[]
Other	7	0	My clue's pointing over there now!	[]
Other	6	0	Oh, let's follow that clue!	[]
Stan	10	1	Did they find out who crapped in the urinal yet?	['crapped']
Kyle	2	0	Not yet.	[]
Cartman	35	0	They aren't going to find out who did it. But they'll make up a scapegoat, send him to detention, and make us all believe it. It'll be 9/11 all over again.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Will you shut up about 9/11!	[]
Cartman	9	0	Kyle, why are you so afraid of the truth?!	[]
Kyle	12	1	Because anybody who thinks 9/11 was a conspiracy is a retard!	['retard']
Cartman	31	1	Oh really? Well did you know that over one-fourth of people in America think that 9/11 was a conspiracy? Are you saying that one-fourth of Americans are retards?	['retards']
Kyle	10	1	Yes. I'm saying one-fourth of Americans are retards.	['retards']
Stan	5	0	Yeah, at least one-fourth.	[]
Kyle	19	1	Let's take a test sample: There's four of us, you're a retard, that's one-fourth.	['retard']
Cartman	12	0	...There are soo many people who know the truth, Kyle. Uh Butters!	[]
Butters	2	0	Hey, fellas!	[]
Cartman	24	0	Butters, do you think 9/11 was just a plot by some angry terrorists, or do you think there was some kind of coverup?	[]
Butters	11	0	Well, I heard that 9/11 was caused by President Bush.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Aha! Do you see?	[]
Kyle	5	0	Where did you hear that?	[]
Butters	2	0	From Eric.	[]
Cartman	4	0	I rest my case.	[]
Kyle	9	0	Butters, you don't really believe that, do you?	[]
Butters	31	1	Well, l-uh, I mean, uh, you never know. Uh, the government does some pretty spooky things. The government and the corporations headed by the Jews that tear down 9/11.	['jews']
Cartman	4	0	That's right, Butters.	[]
Kyle	12	2	Goddamnit, you see what happens when you spread this stupid crap, fatass?	['goddamnit', 'crap']
Cartman	5	0	What? People see the truth?	[]
Butters	4	0	Can I go now?	[]
Cartman	46	0	You guys are blind! I can't believe that everyone here is just buying into what they're told by the media!  I'm gonna go find out the truth. I'm gonna blow the lid off this whooole 9/11 conspiracy once and for all!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Oh no...	[]
Cartman	78	0	It is wrong for me to ask questions?Is it wrong to seek the truth?I just can't blindly accept their version.I can't base my logic on proof.Almost all the evidence points one way,But I'm like Charlie Sheen and Gloria Estefan:I need to know what really happenedOn 9/11-leven-leven-leven-leven.What really happenedOn 9/11?Of course. It's so obvious. How did we not see it before?	[]
Other	28	0	This is my frog.  He doesn't have a name. He's a frog not a toad because toads don't ribbit. I think frogs are good pets.	[]
Other	23	0	Okay, thank you, Leroy, thanks for sharing your dumb little frog with the class. Okay, anybody else have anything for Show and Tell?	[]
Cartman	4	0	Uh! Erh, eh. Uhhh!	[]
Other	7	0	All right, Eric, you can go next.	[]
Cartman	20	0	For Show and Tell today I have brought...  ...my shocking Powerpoint report on the truth!..  behind the 9/11 attacks!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Oh Christ...	[]
Cartman	83	0	We are told to believe that the fire from the jet fuel melted the steel framing of the towers,  which led to their collapse. But did you know jet fuel doesn't burn at a high enough temperature to melt steel?  We were told the Pentagon was hit by a hijacked plane as well,  but now look at this photo of the Pentagon. The hole is not nearly big enough. And if a plane hit it, where is the rest of the plane?	[]
Clyde	1	0	Whoa...	[]
Cartman	78	0	So now, the inevitable question: if terrorists didn't cause 9/11, who did?  Remember that there are in fact two towers. Two minus one is one; one one - 11; two minus one is one; one one, and there are nine members on Silverstein's board of directors. That's nine-one-one. Nine-eleven. And take 2 - 1 + 9/11 and you get 12, which leads us all to the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. . Kyle!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Me??!	[]
Cartman	127	3	Twelve contains the numbers one and two, just like the toilet yesterday where somebody went number two instead of number one! And one and two with 911 and you get 914! Drop the 4 and it's 91! Exactly the score Kyle got on his spelling test twelve days after 9/11! Who has the most to gain from 9/11?! Kyle! Who was nowhere to be found the morning the towers fell?! Kyle! Who dropped the deuce in the urinal?! Kyle! But probably the most damning of all is the evidence seen in this photo of Tower 2!  When I zoomed in I saw what first appeared to be a blur,  but when I computer-enhanced it,  You almost got away with it, you sneaky butthole.	['deuce', 'damning', 'butthole']
Kyle	10	0	Hey Token.  You-you gonna watch the game tonight, Butters?	[]
Butters	1	0	Waaaah!	[]
Kyle	13	1	All right, all right, I was not responsible for 9/11!  God-damnit!	['damnit']
Other	6	0	Hello bubbe, how was school today?	[]
Kyle	1	0	Terrible.	[]
Other	9	0	Oh, come on, school isn't all that bad.	[]
Kyle	9	0	But, everyone thinks I was responsible for 9/11.	[]
Other	1	0	Whatwhatwhaaat?!	[]
Other	17	0	We have to do something! It is obvious our children are still completely confused about 9/11!	[]
Other	17	0	Yes, we need to go over it again in the classroom so they understand what really happened.	[]
Other	17	0	Well, what really happened? There's strong evidence that what we were told isn't the truth.	[]
Other	6	0	Oh no, oh brother, oh God.	[]
Other	17	0	That's right. Did you know that there were explosions seen at the base of the towers?	[]
Other	8	1	Oh no, oh God, that's so retarded.	['retarded']
Mr. Mackey	27	0	Look, what-ever you believe, the fact of the matter is somebody... dropped a dookie in the school urinal, and there's still no explanation for that!	[]
Other	10	0	Mr. Mackey, there are more important things going on here!	[]
Mr. Mackey	59	0	More important?! You aren't the one, who had to walk into the boys' bathroom, okay, after having tuh, to wake up early, you know, there's no, no coffee in the teachers' lounge, and then you, you walk into the bathroom just to find a big dook laying there in the urinal! Like it's laughin' at you!	[]
Other	15	1	He's right! The turd could have been put there to cover up 9/11!	['turd']
Mr. Mackey	8	0	No, I'm not saying they're related!	[]
Randy	16	0	How do we know they're not? We need to be brave enough to ask questions!	[]
Other	23	0	It's obvious that before we go any further, we need to find out who was behind 9/11 once and for all!	[]
Other	6	0	Who else could it have been?	[]
Other	18	0	This is too big a mystery for me. I think we'd better call in the Hardly Boys.	[]
Mr. Mackey	5	1	Oh no, not the Goddamned-	['goddamned']
Other	24	0	The Hardly Boys. Two young whippersnappers with a knack for solving mysteries. The Hardly Boys in:  The Case of the World Trade Center Conspiracy.	[]
Other	24	0	So that's about the long and short of it, Hardly Boys. There were two towers that stood right here,  and they're gone.	[]
Other	6	0	And nobody knows who's responsible?	[]
Other	7	0	There are theories, but, nobody's certain.	[]
Other	9	0	Nnnn, who would benefit most from two buildings disappearing?	[]
Other	8	0	Ooo... oh, I just started getting a clue.	[]
Other	1	0	Really?	[]
Other	7	0	Yeah, I'm totally getting a clue.	[]
Other	19	0	Oh... Oh, that's giving me a clue. Yeah, ye-yeah, I've got a raging clue right now.	[]
Other	6	0	Mine's pointing to the left.	[]
Other	20	0	Oh F-, oh Frank, seriously, I have such a raging clue right now, I think we'd better follow it.	[]
Other	7	0	Okay, let's follow your raging clue.	[]
Other	1	0	Oofff.	[]
Randy	1	0	Godspeed.	[]
Stan	1	0	Kyle!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Aaaah!	[]
Stan	19	0	Dude, do you mind telling me why CIA guys  are coming to my house and questioning me about you??	[]
Kyle	17	0	I don't know, dude. It's like everyone's putting pieces together that aren't there.	[]
Stan	8	0	Well why did you have to involve me??	[]
Kyle	5	0	It's not my fault.	[]
Stan	31	0	All right, look, I've been doing a lot of research on the Web and I found an organization who says they can prove you weren't involved in 9/11.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Really?	[]
Stan	34	0	Come on. We'll go out the back so they don't see you.  There's just one thing I need to know before we go: you weren't responsible for 9/11, right?	[]
Kyle	1	0	......Dude.	[]
Stan	5	0	That's all I needed.	[]
Mr. Mackey	145	3	Now you might all think I've given up finding out who crapped in the urinal. M'kay? And maybe, maybe you think it's a victimless crime. This, is Mr. Venezuela , the school janitor. Okay?  He's the person... who has to clean up... when some trickster... drops a dook in the wrong toilet! Mr. Venezuela makes six bucks an hour at best! Okay? He's got three kids at home, he's got a car that barely works, he's gotta clean up puke with sawdust, m'kay, then he walks into the boys' room and sees a big meaty chud starin' him in the face!  So when you crapped in that urinal, m'kay, you might as well have just dropped your pants, and laid a turd right on top of Mr. Venezuela's head!  Oh, you think it's funny, huh?!	['crapped', 'crapped', 'turd']
Other	5	0	Mr. Mackey!  We got him.	[]
Mr. Mackey	1	0	Huh?	[]
Other	7	0	We caught the person that did it.	[]
Stan	16	0	Hi, we were hoping you can help us. My friend is being blamed for 9/11.	[]
Other	23	0	Aw geez. Come on in, kids.  It doesn't surprise me. More and more people are being blamed for 9/11 every day.	[]
Kyle	2	0	They are?	[]
Kyle	4	0	What? No no no.	[]
Stan	9	0	Dude, why would the government attack its own buildings?	[]
Kyle	3	1	...That's retarded.	['retarded']
Kyle	19	0	There's a lot of holes in the Theory of Evolution too; it doesn't mean it's wrong.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Code 234	[]
Kyle	3	0	What is it?	[]
Kyle	1	0	Anthrax?!	[]
Kyle	12	0	Stan, we can't be seen with this nutjob!  Aw, aw, awww!	[]
Mr. Mackey	7	0	Why, Clyde? Why did you do it?	[]
Clyde	4	0	I don't know.	[]
Mr. Mackey	87	0	You got a whole school here, Clyde! M'kay? You got over three hundred people that need to use the boys' room.  Then you decide you're gonna be a comedian, m'kay, and pinch one off in the urinal, and leave it layin' there for everyone to have to look at!  Okay okay, you think it's funny, but nobody else does! They gotta walk in that bathroom and see your rancid dook propped up against the back of the urinal like a brown rag doll!	[]
Other	7	0	Mr. Mackey, Clyde's parents are here.	[]
Mr. Mackey	43	0	M'kay, that's good!  Let's see what your mom and dad have to say about your little poopscapade!  Come on in, please. I'm just trying to get your son to explain why... he would drop a dook in the urinal!	[]
Other	8	0	Mr. Mackey, there's something you should know...	[]
Kyle	8	0	Eh-xcuse me, there's been a misunderstanding.	[]
Other	5	0	Come on in, Mr. President.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Uh, Mr. President, my name is-	[]
Other	37	0	SSHHUUDDUUPP!! You think we don't know your name?! We know everything! We control everything!  We've all worked very hard to keep our involvement in 9/11 a secret! But you just had to keep digging!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Really?	[]
Other	20	0	People? You mean sheeple. We have the majority of them kept in blissful ignorance. Just one more... leak...  to fix...	[]
Other	14	0	You've been a thorn in our side for too long, I'm afraid.	[]
Other	2	0	Too late.	[]
Stan	2	0	JESUS CHRIST!!	[]
Other	6	0	Hahaha. He died like a pig.	[]
Other	4	0	Some pigs never learn.	[]
Kyle	2	0	No. Way.	[]
Stan	8	0	He was right. You DID cause 9/11.	[]
Other	91	0	Yes. Quite simple to pull off, really. All I had to do was have explosives planted in the base of the towers. Then on 9/11 we pretended like four planes were being hijacked.when really we just rerouted them to Pennsylvania, then flew two military jets into the World Trade Center filled with more explosives, then shot down all the witnesses of Flight 93 with an F-15 after blowing up the Pentagon with a Cruise missile. It was only the world's most intricate and flawlessly-executed ever, ever.	[]
Kyle	1	0	...Really??	[]
Stan	1	0	Why?!	[]
Other	33	0	Oldest reason in the world. Money. The towers fell and the American sheeple all waved their flags.  Finally we could invade Iraq,  and get the oil which made us all richer than before.	[]
Other	3	0	Beauutiful money, hahahaha!	[]
Kyle	1	0	...Really??	[]
Stan	7	0	Is the whole government in on this?	[]
Other	10	0	We are all-knowing and all-powerful. Good-bye, boys.	[]
Other	4	0	Dangit! I missed again!	[]
Other	5	0	For Christ's sake, Cheney!	[]
Stan	2	0	Kyle! Run!	[]
Other	2	0	KILL THEM!	[]
Mr. Mackey	158	2	Attention students. Apparently, Clyde could not have been the one who crapped in the urinal, because Clyde had a colostomy at age 5. 'Kay? Now, whoever did this unspeakable act is still at large. The boys' bathroom is closed until further notice, 'cause one of you thought it would be a good idea... to pull down your pants... m'kay, hover your buttcheeks over the urinal... and squeeze out a chocolate hot dog... m'kay?  Oh you think that's funny, huh?!  Let me assure you, there is nothing funny... about going up to a nice, clean, unsuspectin' urinal,  'kay, droppin' your pants then... turnin' around... squattin' over that urinal, 'kay, maybe... maybe pullin' your buttcheeks apart with your hands, m'kay, and then layin' out a big fudge dragon for all the world to see.  Oh yeah, that's real funny!  I'm gonna catch this sonofabitch if it's the last thing I DO! M'kay?!	['crapped', 'sonofabitch']
Stan	32	0	All right, now we have to switch over to Interbus 65. We made it dude.  We should be home in less than eighteen hours. Then we'll tell everyone what we saw.	[]
Kyle	6	0	It just... doesn't seem right.	[]
Stan	16	0	Yeah, our eyes are finally open, dude. It's like waking up for the first time.	[]
Kyle	43	0	Yeah... but doesn't it seem like we got out of the White House pretty easily? I mean, it seems like it would be pretty hard to escape from the White House with everyone chasing you, and we just kind of... ran out.	[]
Stan	13	0	Well dude, maybe we're just super badass. Have you thought of that?	[]
Kyle	8	0	Hey!  Dude. You're alive?  Come back here!	[]
Other	1	0	Hey!	[]
Other	1	0	Ogh!	[]
Kyle	7	1	Dude! What the hell is going on?!	['hell']
Stan	3	0	What who said?	[]
Kyle	8	0	Dude, we aren't going to kill you.	[]
Stan	2	0	Oh God!	[]
Other	8	0	It isn't safe here, boys. Follow me!	[]
Kyle	5	1	Who the fuck are you?!	['fuck']
Other	6	0	There's no time! come on!	[]
Kyle	11	1	Do you mind telling us what the hell is going on??	['hell']
Stan	3	0	Who are you?	[]
Other	15	0	I'm a detective, and I'm afraid that you kids have been double-crossed.	[]
Kyle	7	0	You f-figured this thing all out?	[]
Other	34	0	Not me. My mystery-solving sons. Come on in, boys.  My boys were researching who went number two in the urinal at your school when they discovered something odd, which gave them a clue.	[]
Other	5	0	Gave us both a clue.	[]
Other	18	0	That clue led them to a 9/11 conspiracy group party, where they got a lot more clues.	[]
Other	9	0	I was getting a clue like every two minutes.	[]
Other	15	0	I got such a raging clue that I almost shot clue goo all over Joe.	[]
Other	24	0	Those clues pointed out that all the 9/11 conspiracy theories could be disproven scientifically. And that's when Frank got his biggest clue.	[]
Other	3	0	It was huuuge.	[]
Other	21	0	That all the 9/11 conspiracy Web sites are run by the government. The 9/11 conspiracy... is a government conspiracy.	[]
Stan	2	0	Aw Jesus...	[]
Kyle	12	0	Why would the government want people to believe they caused 9/11?	[]
Other	35	0	For a government to have power, they must appear to have complete control. What better way to make people fear them than to convince them they are capable of the most elaborate plan on earth?	[]
Other	31	0	That's quite enough, Hardly!  Don't believe what he says, boys; we caused 9/11.  It's all right here in these secret documents,  but you'll never get them.	[]
Kyle	17	0	I knew it! You didn't plan 9/11 and you really didn't shoot that guy!	[]
Other	35	0	Boys, you don't understand. People need to think we are all-powerful. That we control the world. If they know we weren't in charge of 9/11 then... we appear to control nothing.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Well why don't you just tell people the truth?!	[]
Other	32	1	We do that too. And most people believe the truth. But one fourth of the population is retarded. If they wanna believe we control everything with intricate plans, why not let them?	['retarded']
Other	15	0	Just one thing, Mr. President: How the devil did you know we were all here?	[]
Stan	16	0	How come you couldn't just go home, dude? That's all we had to do!	[]
Kyle	4	1	Stan! What the fuck?!	['fuck']
Stan	5	0	It was all planned out!	[]
Kyle	6	0	You knew this whole time? Why?	[]
Stan	15	0	Because it was me. I'm the one who took a dump in the urinal.	[]
Kyle	1	0	What??	[]
Stan	23	0	The stalls were full and I didn't wanna miss recess! I didn't think it would turn into such a big deal!	[]
Kyle	5	0	So you blamed the government?!	[]
Other	22	0	And the government was more than willing to take the blame, so long as it made them look responsible for 9/11!	[]
Stan	21	0	Oh man, now everyone's gonna know. Why did the stupid Hardly Boys have to be so good at solving mysteries?	[]
Kyle	26	0	So wait, wait: Stan took a dump in the urinal and he contacted the conspiracy Web site? But the conspiracy site was run by the government?	[]
Stan	1	0	Yuh.	[]
Kyle	8	0	So then, who was responsible for 9/11?	[]
Stan	8	0	Whattaya mean? A bunch of pissed-off Muslims.	[]
Other	5	1	Yeah. What are you, retarded?	['retarded']
Other	17	0	Well, it looks like this mystery is solved. It's time for the culprit to finally pay!	[]
Mr. Mackey	51	0	When you dook in the urinal, it's bad, m'kay!  How would you feel... if somebody came into your home, m'kay, pulled down their pants and laid a big mud monkey right on your mom's face?  Oh you think that's funny, huh?! Yeah, that's real funny!	[]
