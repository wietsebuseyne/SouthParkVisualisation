Other	39	0	All right, students, let's take our seats. Everyone try to be nice because we have a new student joining us today, and I know you'll all make him feel welcome. Say hello to... Baahir Hassan Abdul Hakeem.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Uh oh!	[]
Other	5	0	Welcome to our class, Baahir.	[]
Other	2	0	Thank you.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Duhude, dude,  not cool!	[]
Other	14	0	Why don't you take a seat in Kyle's empty desk for now?	[]
Other	1	0	Okay.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Oooh hooohoho. Nooo, noohoohoo.	[]
Other	8	1	Eric, what the hell is wrong with you?!	['hell']
Cartman	9	0	What's wrong?  Has he been checked for bombs?	[]
Other	10	0	Eric, that's enough! Not all Muslim people are terrorists!	[]
Cartman	14	0	No, but most of them are. And all it takes is most of them.	[]
Butters	4	0	Now you go, Baahir.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Yeah?	[]
Cartman	6	0	Kyle, are you on your computer?	[]
Kyle	5	0	What? No, I'm sick.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Get online. I need you to check something for me.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Dude, leave me alone.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Kyle, every one of our friends might be in serious danger!	[]
Kyle	2	0	What? Why?	[]
Cartman	3	0	Get online now!	[]
Kyle	4	0	All right, all right.	[]
Cartman	14	0	Go to MySpace.  See if there's a MySpace page for a Baahir Hakeem.	[]
Kyle	20	0	Baahir Hakeem.  Born in Chicago, eight years old, his favorite color is green... Car, Cartman, what is this all about?	[]
Cartman	16	0	Kyle, I want you to check his buddy list. How many MySpace friends does he have?	[]
Kyle	3	0	Over a hundred.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Look further down the page. Does he list his favorite band?	[]
Kyle	2	0	White Stripes	[]
Cartman	3	0	That's funny.	[]
Kyle	1	0	What?	[]
Cartman	12	0	He told everyone in class today his favorite band was Blink 182.	[]
Cartman	9	0	The following takes place between Recess and Geography class.	[]
Other	1	0	Hello?	[]
Cartman	9	0	Officer Barbrady, South Park Elementary is in serious danger!	[]
Other	5	0	From what? Who is this?	[]
Cartman	26	0	I've just ID'd a Muslim and his MySpace page does not check out. You've got to get these people out of here now!	[]
Other	3	0	Are you serious?	[]
Cartman	11	0	If I wasn't serious, would I be talking like this?	[]
Other	2	0	Like what?	[]
Cartman	8	0	Whispering, but whispering really loudly for dramatic effect.	[]
Other	2	0	Oh jeez.	[]
Other	3	1	What the hell?	['hell']
Other	8	0	All students are to evacuate the school immediately!	[]
Butters	16	0	Hey, Baahir, uh since we get to go home, you wanna come over uh, play checkers?	[]
Other	2	0	Sure, okay.	[]
Butters	3	0	Well all right!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Dude.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Kyle	13	0	Dude, I just got an IM from Stan that they evacuated the school.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Yeah. Now do you believe me that somethin' is goin' on?!	[]
Kyle	3	0	I guess so.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Yeah well I don't like it! It doesn't follow!	[]
Kyle	5	0	Wuh what doesn't follow?	[]
Cartman	40	0	Why would a terrorist just blow up a school? It's not their M.O. Unless... Oh my God! Unless this was all just a big diversion.  Kyle, I need you to Google-search the South Park Chamber of Commerce!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Okay.	[]
Cartman	18	0	Their Web site should have a calendar of events: is there anything big going on in town today?!	[]
Kyle	4	0	Yeah. Actually, there is.	[]
Cartman	1	0	What?	[]
Kyle	9	0	There's a Hillary Clinton campaign rally.  Cartman? ...Cartman?	[]
Other	21	0	Sir! There's somebody calling in saying there's going to be a terrorist attack on the Hillary Clinton rally today.	[]
Other	7	0	What?  This is CIA head, Alan Thompson.	[]
Cartman	17	0	Mr. Thompson, you have to call off the Clinton rally! There's a terrorist in South Park!	[]
Other	4	0	What do you know?	[]
Cartman	17	0	He just showed up out of the blue! I need to speak with the President right away!	[]
Other	11	0	I'm the head of the CIA! You can tell me!	[]
Cartman	9	0	I said I will only talk to the President!	[]
Other	10	0	Look, if you have information of a threat, you could-	[]
Cartman	1	0	LALALALALALALALA!	[]
Other	6	0	I will have you arrested for-!	[]
Cartman	10	0	LALALA-I can't hear you! Only the President! LALALALALALA!	[]
Other	7	0	Call is coming through now, Mr. President.	[]
Other	1	0	Hello?	[]
Cartman	12	0	President Bush, this is Eric Cartman! Are we on a secure line?	[]
Other	2	0	Huh? Who.	[]
Cartman	18	0	Look, I know you're not the biggest Hildog fan, but she is in great danger right now!	[]
Other	1	0	Hildog?	[]
Other	9	0	Yes, I understand. I'll let Ms. Clinton know.	[]
Other	4	0	What is it, Brian?	[]
Other	15	0	Ms. Clinton, we just received word of a possible terrorist attack on your rally today.	[]
Other	4	0	Is the thread credible?	[]
Other	13	0	We aren't sure, but... perhaps it's best we call it off.	[]
Other	29	0	No. No, I will not be bullied by terrorist threats. Your men do a good job, Brian. I have faith that any thread will be taken care of accordingly.	[]
Other	7	0	We've reached the rally site, Hildog.	[]
Other	12	0	Don't worry, Mrs. Clinton, I'm sure everything will be fine.	[]
Other	3	0	Thank you, Chris.	[]
Other	5	0	They know about the bomb!	[]
Other	15	0	That is impossible! We took every measure to assure the bomb was hidden from sight.	[]
Other	19	0	Well somebody tipped off the CIA. I don't know how much they know, but security has been heightened.	[]
Other	10	0	That bomb must travel with the Clinton rally to Boston!	[]
Other	24	0	The bomb won't make it to Boston now! With the heightened security, it's only a matter of time before they find it!	[]
Other	12	0	Then we have no choice. We have to move up the attack.	[]
Other	3	0	I understand, comrade.	[]
Other	9	0	Prepare yourself. We detonate the bomb... within the hour.	[]
Cartman	16	0	Kyle, I'm at the Clinton rally site, but there's no sign of that kid!	[]
Kyle	6	0	So then maybe you're wrong.	[]
Cartman	19	0	Nope, I'm not wrong. He must be somehow attacking remotely from his house. Did you find the address?	[]
Kyle	20	0	Yeah. I cross-referenced his MySpace page with realtor.com. His parents moved into that green house on Janice Street.	[]
Cartman	30	0	Jesus, that's on the other side of town. All right, Kyle, I'm going to take a picture with my camera phone and upload it to you. You ready?	[]
Kyle	4	0	Yeah.  What is that?	[]
Cartman	4	1	It's my balls!	['balls']
Kyle	4	1	God damn it Cartman!	['damn']
Cartman	8	0	Okay. Okay, Kyle, let's stay focused here.	[]
Other	21	0	People of South Park, it is my honor to introduce a woman who deserves nothing but respect. Mrs. Hillary Rodham Clinton!	[]
Other	17	0	It is so nice to be back in a small town like the one I came from.	[]
Other	3	0	Here we go!	[]
Other	7	0	Otis Green, anything on that bomb threat?	[]
Other	20	0	We have the bomb-sniffing pig going through the crowd. If there is a bomb, the pig will find it.	[]
Other	24	0	This is why I campaign in small towns like these! Because it is in towns like South Park that you find the true America!	[]
Other	7	0	Oh my God, she got a scent!	[]
Other	1	0	What?!	[]
Other	15	0	The pig is picking up the smell of nuclear residue. Terrorists have hidden a bomb!	[]
Other	10	0	Oh my God! Where?! Where could they have stashed it?!	[]
Other	5	0	Come on, find it. Find!	[]
Other	8	0	My God, they hid it under the stage?!	[]
Other	3	0	No wait, look.	[]
Other	43	0	How much money do we have to waste on needless spendin' when we should be focusing all our attention on... uh...  on the education of all- Woo haha, whoa there, girl. Haha,  uh, uh, on the education of all children.  Oh, I declare!	[]
Other	17	0	Oh my God. Do you think they could have hidden a nuclear device up Mrs. Clinton's...	[]
Other	36	0	Mr. Thompson, the kid who called in the warning was right! We uncovered intel that terrorists have obtained a nuclear device, and that they have most likely hidden it in Mrs. Clinton's... well, in her...	[]
Other	3	0	In her what?	[]
Other	4	0	In her snatch, sir.	[]
Other	1	0	What?!	[]
Other	8	0	What is goin' on? I wasn't finished.	[]
Other	7	0	Security measure, Mrs. Clinton. Probably nothing.  Yes.	[]
Other	25	0	Mr. Jeffries, this is Alan Thompson with the CIA. We have reason to believe that Mrs. Clinton may have a nuclear device up her snatch.	[]
Other	2	0	A what?!	[]
Other	9	1	A snatch. It's the technical term for vagina.	['vagina']
Other	8	0	No, I mean what kind of nuclear device?!	[]
Other	24	1	Mr. Jeffries, this is Frank Waters. It's a suitcase nuke, designed to fit in a woman's snizz. It's called a snuke.	['snuke']
Other	5	0	What is goin' on, Brian?	[]
Other	13	1	Ms. Clinton, it appears that terrorists have snuck a snuke up your snizz.	['snuke']
Other	2	0	Oh my.	[]
Other	9	0	What do we do? Can we disable the timer?	[]
Other	19	0	It won't have a timer. Snukes are detonated remotely. Whoever our terrorist is has a detonator with him.	[]
Other	4	0	But then that means...	[]
Other	21	0	Yes. If we don't find that detonator, everyone in the town of South Park is going to die. For-ever.	[]
Other	6	0	Do we have that phone trace?	[]
Other	7	0	The call is going through now, sir.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Yeah?	[]
Other	11	0	This is CIA head Alan Thompson. We spoke before about the-	[]
Cartman	3	0	Yes, Mr. Thompson?	[]
Other	8	0	Well, we've just arrived in your town.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Why? Did you find something?	[]
Other	11	0	Yes. There's a suitcase nuke in Ms. Clinton's snizz.	[]
Cartman	2	1	A snuke?	['snuke']
Other	21	0	That's right. It's controlled by a remote detonator. We have to locate the terrorist before he sets it off.	[]
Cartman	19	0	I have the address of the house the terrorist moved into. I'm almost there now; where are you?	[]
Other	14	0	We're on the town's main street, right by an ice cream shop.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Oh dude, I'm, I'm right next to you.	[]
Other	2	0	Oh, hey.	[]
Stan	8	0	Dude, we totally got let out of school.	[]
Kyle	40	0	I know. Something big is going on. Take a look at this. I did a Google search for Hillary Clinton Campaign Rally right? And one of the links was to YouTube, where this Russian guy had a bunch of videos.	[]
Stan	1	0	Russian?	[]
Kyle	14	0	Yeah, this guy.  Vladimir Stolfsky. He had videos on YouTube of every single rally.	[]
Stan	7	0	So he's a Hillary Clinton fan.	[]
Kyle	29	0	No. I cross-referenced his YouTube profile with MySpace, and according to his blog, he's an old-school Communist. So what's he doing at every Clinton rally?	[]
Stan	10	0	Do a WebCrawler search: maybe he has podcasts up somewhere.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Oh that's a good idea.	[]
Other	8	0	What is going on? What have we done?	[]
Other	10	0	They claim they don't know anything about an attack.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Big surprise!	[]
Other	14	1	Sir, first pass of the house, we didn't find a snuke detonator anywhere.	['snuke']
Other	6	0	Mr. Hakeem, where is your son?	[]
Other	11	0	We thought he was at school. He's not at school?	[]
Other	6	0	You're doing great, Ms. Clinton.	[]
Other	16	1	Do they know how long, Brian? How long before the snuke in my snizz goes off?	['snuke']
Other	6	0	They'll find the detonator, Hildog.	[]
Other	36	0	We can't wait for them to find the detonator. If we can get to the bomb, me-maybe we can deactivate it. Can't somebody go and take a look inside Mrs. Clinton's snizz?	[]
Other	10	0	I'm not sending any of my men in there.	[]
Other	9	0	Are you almost ready to set off the bomb?	[]
Other	10	0	Everything is set. We have the detonator up and running.	[]
Other	10	0	Mr. Hakeem, we need to know where your son is!	[]
Other	7	0	I tell you, I do not know.	[]
Other	13	0	This is getting us nowhere. If he knows anything, he's not saying.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Let me have time with him.	[]
Other	6	0	What are you going to do?	[]
Cartman	20	0	We have to find that detonator! Let me have time with him!  You will tell me where your son is!	[]
Other	6	0	He should be at school!  Hey!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Where is the detonator?!	[]
Other	6	0	Wuh-what detonator are you ta-	[]
Cartman	6	0	I can do this aaall day.	[]
Other	11	0	I don't know anything about a-  Aawwwwgh  Stop it! Really!	[]
Cartman	5	0	You can make it stop!	[]
Other	5	0	I don't have the-	[]
Other	8	0	Are we just gonna let this go on?	[]
Kyle	20	0	Okay, I got a text of the Russian guy's podcast. It's all a bunch of links to eBay.	[]
Stan	19	0	You should be able to search his username on eBay and see what he's been buying and selling.	[]
Other	13	0	Ferris, set up over there. Two of you can take that bed area.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Hey.	[]
Other	5	0	Donner, take over that station.	[]
Kyle	4	0	What's going on?	[]
Other	8	0	This apartment is being absorbed by Homeland Security!	[]
Kyle	2	0	...Homeland Security?	[]
Other	27	0	Look, your little game of goin' over people's heads is over! You could still work, but from now on you answer to me, you got that?!	[]
Other	7	0	'Scuse me, who's in charge here?!	[]
Other	2	0	I am!	[]
Other	16	0	Yeah well not anymore you're not. This apartment has just been assigned to the FBI.	[]
Other	6	0	That's outrageous! On whose orders?!	[]
Other	16	0	On order of the Secretary of Defense! You had your shot, now I'm in charge!	[]
Other	30	0	Not anymore you're not! Orders just came down from Central! They want ATF handling this on all fronts! All right people, from now on you're answering to me!	[]
Other	22	0	Not anymore they're not! Orders from the President: he wants this handled by his staff personally! Now Nelson is in charge.	[]
Other	5	0	Not anymore I'm not!	[]
Other	9	0	What are you going to do to my wife?!	[]
Cartman	9	0	Nothing... if you tell me where your son is!	[]
Other	7	0	We told you: we don't know.	[]
Cartman	15	1	Do you know what this is?!  This... is apple juice. It gives super bad farts.	['farts']
Other	8	0	Did he just inject himself with apple juice?	[]
Cartman	4	0	Where is your son?!	[]
Other	5	0	She doesn't know either.	[]
Other	2	0	Aaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaah!	[]
Other	11	0	I mean it! Stop! That is disgusting! Where is your mother?!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Answer it!	[]
Other	10	0	Hallo? Hallo Baahir. Where are you? Who it But-ters?	[]
Cartman	1	0	Butters.	[]
Other	11	0	Baahir, one of your classmates is keeping us hostage.  Aaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaah!	[]
Other	5	0	Ogh! You filthy little rapscallion!	[]
Cartman	8	0	We got him! I know where he is!	[]
Other	9	0	All right, where? We'll send our people in.	[]
Cartman	6	0	No no, he's my lead.	[]
Other	5	0	You're not going alone.	[]
Cartman	23	0	You blow in there and you risk taking him down without finding the detonator! I'm going to find out where it is!	[]
Other	37	0	All right, people, I'm in charge now and we will find the terrorists. Jarvis, I want you to check for any terrorist chatter on AOL. Marley and Greggs, try searching for nuclear devices on askjeeves.com.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Ask Jeeves? Nobody uses Ask Jeeves! Just Google-search it!	[]
Other	9	0	Are you tellin' me how to do my job?	[]
Kyle	19	0	Yes. There's a Russian guy named Vladimir Stolfsky who's got search engine hits all over this thing.	[]
Other	13	0	Chase, search the name Stolfsky on YouTube and cross-reference it with JDate!	[]
Other	1	0	Checking.	[]
Stan	21	0	Look, these Russian guys all have blogs talking about this like it's just some big diversion for something much bigger!	[]
Other	21	0	Sir, these kids are right. We've just received intel that Russian terrorists are believed to be responsible for the threat.	[]
Other	5	0	Where's the intel from?	[]
Other	7	0	We just read it on Drudge Report.	[]
Kyle	20	0	Look, we already have the guy's blog. Maybe we can find an address and check it out on MapQuest.	[]
Other	11	0	We do this my way! I'm the one in charge!	[]
Kyle	5	0	...Not anymore you're not.	[]
Other	2	0	Oh, snap.	[]
Butters	9	0	Whoopee! I captured another one of your pieces, Baahir.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Uuugh!	[]
Butters	3	0	Oh hey Eric.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Where is the detonator!	[]
Other	2	0	The what?	[]
Cartman	17	1	You have exactly five seconds before I start dropping serious apple juice farts on your face! One!	['farts']
Other	4	0	Leave me alone!  Upta!	[]
Butters	6	0	Hey, I was about to win!	[]
Cartman	7	0	Stop, terrorist, or I will shoot you!	[]
Other	4	0	Get in the van!	[]
Cartman	10	0	Uh, that's cool. I'm actually not... playing anymore.	[]
Other	4	0	Get in the van!	[]
Other	25	1	That's it! We don't have a choice anymore! Somebody is going to have to go in, and try to disarm the snuke manually!	['snuke']
Other	19	0	No, it's too dangerous! That snatch has not seen action in over 30 years! It could be toxic!	[]
Other	12	0	I'll do it! I'll check out Ms. Clinton's snizz.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Let me go! Please! I am just a little boy!	[]
Other	37	1	You called and warned the government of our plans! What you don't know is that we are simply mercenaries! We were paid to set up the snuke so that the real enemy of America could attack!	['snuke']
Cartman	9	0	That's cool. I'm fine with Muslims invading.	[]
Other	10	0	Do you really think Muslims are behind this terrorist threat?!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Uhh yes, of course?	[]
Other	15	0	America had other enemies before the Muslims, you know. Who is America's oldest enemy?	[]
Cartman	2	0	The Russians?	[]
Other	2	0	Before that.	[]
Cartman	2	0	The Germans?	[]
Other	2	0	Before that.	[]
Cartman	3	0	The Germans again?	[]
Other	18	0	Before that! I am talking about the oldest threat to America! The greatest enemy America has ever known!	[]
Cartman	5	0	You can't possible mean...?	[]
Other	18	0	Two hundred years we've waited. Finally. We will get those traitors to the Crown!  Yes, Your Majesty?	[]
Other	11	0	The Russians are ready to set off the diversion. Full sail.	[]
Other	4	0	Full sail, Your Majesty?	[]
Other	22	1	All right, Brian, this is it. Get in there and see if you can disarm the snuke in Ms. Clinton's snatch.	['snuke']
Other	8	0	All right. I'm nearing her snizz now.	[]
Other	3	0	God help him.	[]
Other	5	0	What do you see, Brian?	[]
Other	4	0	It's dark... cold...	[]
Other	19	0	You're doing fine, Brian. Get as close as you can... Y-you have to look inside the snizz.	[]
Other	14	0	Uh, uh, all right, I'm looking. Yes, I see... I see the device!	[]
Other	8	0	You're doin' great, Brian. Hang in there.	[]
Other	24	0	There's um, metal housing... some kind of three-pronged triggering mechanism that... Wait there's... there's something else here! There's something...	[]
Other	3	0	Say again, Brian.	[]
Other	16	1	There's something perched on the snuke's coil... Oh God, it's looking at me!	['snuke']
Other	5	0	Brian, get out of there!	[]
Other	17	0	Wha... what are you?! I have no qualm with you! Stay back! Stay back I- agh! Aaagh!	[]
Other	5	0	Brian? Brian, what's happening?	[]
Other	10	0	It's... eating my head! It's eating my head!	[]
Other	2	0	Hoh my!	[]
Kyle	38	0	I got it! I got it! According to PayPal, the Russian guys are just hired mercenaries who had ads up on Craig's List and got paid through eBay so that Boston could be attacked by... the British.	[]
Other	2	0	The British?	[]
Other	3	0	Loyalist Red Coats!	[]
Other	16	0	Sir, I found the Russian's eHarmony account! It does list an address in South Park!	[]
Kyle	5	0	All right! MapQuest the address!	[]
Other	9	0	I'll use Google Maps. It has live traffic.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Good thinking	[]
Other	10	0	Sir, we have the terrorists' location. IM'ing you now.	[]
Other	6	0	It was good knowing you, comrade.	[]
Other	18	0	Please. Think about what you are doing. The British are just using you; you're going to die.	[]
Other	6	0	Yes, but we will be rich.	[]
Other	9	0	Left flank, prig prang and clear! Go go go!	[]
Other	9	0	The game is over! Get down on the ground!	[]
Other	5	0	How did they find us?	[]
Other	13	0	We know about everything! Your diversion to help the Red Coats is over!	[]
Other	20	1	It doesn't matter. The detonator is on a timer. You are too late! In three minutes!  What the hell?!	['hell']
Other	4	0	The power went out!	[]
Other	7	0	Well so then what time is it?	[]
Other	2	1	Oh crap.	['crap']
Other	3	0	Take 'em down!	[]
Other	10	0	No! I don't want to die without being paid!	[]
Other	10	0	The detonator is secured, general. You are cleared to proceed.	[]
Other	7	0	The Rebel Americans know of our attack?!	[]
Other	1	0	How?	[]
Other	3	0	Fire at will!	[]
Other	1	0	Yes?	[]
Other	14	0	Your Majesty, the attack has failed. We were... unable to end the American Revolution.	[]
Other	2	0	I see.	[]
Other	12	0	Well, looks like we saved our country from British rule once again.	[]
Kyle	23	0	Yeah. It just proves we need to learn not to profile one race of people. Because, actually, most of the world hates us.	[]
Cartman	12	0	Well Baahir, I was thinking that maybe I owe you an apology.	[]
Other	1	0	Really?	[]
Cartman	35	0	Yes, but then I realized that, technically, I don't. Because by being suspicious of you I saved your life and everyone else's. So really, you owe me an apology. But that's cool.	[]
Kyle	13	0	...You didn't save everyone, I did! You were just out harassing Muslims!	[]
Cartman	27	0	But if I hadn't called you in the first place to check out the Muslim, you would have just stayed in bed sick all day, right?	[]
Kyle	1	0	...Maybe.	[]
Cartman	28	0	Maybe? If I hadn't called you, you wouldn't have been on your computer checking out the Clinton rally. That means my intolerance of Muslims saved America.	[]
Kyle	6	0	...That is so missing the point.	[]
Cartman	14	0	Me being a bigot stopped a nuclear bomb from going off, yes or no?!	[]
Kyle	12	0	The-that's not the right way to look at it, I-	[]
Cartman	4	0	Yes or no, Kyle?!	[]
Kyle	7	0	No! ...Not... not like you're saying.	[]
Cartman	19	0	But that's all I'm saying: today, bigotry and racism saved the day. Baahir, you get this, right?	[]
Other	22	0	Baahir! Get away from that disgusting child! Get back home and start packing your things! We are leaving this whole intolerant country!	[]
Butters	1	0	Awwwww.	[]
Cartman	17	0	Okay. Who got rid of the Muslims, huh?  That was all me. Simple thank you will suffice.	[]
