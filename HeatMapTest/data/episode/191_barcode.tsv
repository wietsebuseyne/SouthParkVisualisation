Stan	19	0	If you love Juggernaut, Irene, then tell him what you did two years ago! How you killed his child!	[]
Cartman	12	0	It's true. I was pregnant with your child and aborted it.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Irene, no! Why?	[]
Cartman	29	0	Do you know what it's like to have an abortion at seven years old? DO YOU? I've had so many abortions. I just... got addicted to them.	[]

Other	21	0	It isn't real! Don't you people understand that stuff isn't real?! None of it! How stupid are you?!	[]
Other	8	0	What do you mean, it ain't real?	[]
Other	28	0	It's all made up! Fiction! Real wrassling is a serious and respectable sport! Why can't you people understand that that kind of wrestling isn't real?!	[]

Butters	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Kyle	6	0	Let's do this! One! Two!	[]
Other	2	0	Backyard wrestling!	[]
Cartman	34	0	Oh what a perfect night for fighting. Lo, the moon sets upon the tips of the trees and I, the man known as the Rad Russian, start to stir with the excitement of violence.	[]
Stan	47	0	Only a country like yours can breed men of such discontent, Rad Russian. But you don't know what real pain is! PAIN! Like I've known. Abandoned when I was four years old by my parents. Left to die in a cold and dark sewage tunnel!	[]
Other	9	0	Gee, I didn't know his parents did that.	[]
Other	1	0	Shhh.	[]
Other	19	0	I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid we have to terminate your employment here at South Park Elementary.	[]
Other	5	0	You're firing me? Why?!	[]
Other	22	0	The school board has decided to discontinue the wrestling program. Wrestling simply involves too much adult subject matter, like murder and abortion.	[]
Other	25	0	No, this isn't wrassling! THIS ISN'T WRASSLING! Principal Victoria, just let me stay on and I can teach kids what real wrassling is!	[]
Other	10	0	I'm sorry, the board has made up their minds.	[]
Other	10	0	You can't fire me for what these kids do!	[]
Other	11	0	That isn't the only reason you're being let go.	[]
Other	4	0	What do you mean?	[]
Other	11	2	We... found all the gay porn on your iPhone, Mr. Connors.	['gay', 'porn']
Kyle	23	0	So I'm thinking we do the part about Jimmy's relationship with his alcoholic father after you smash Butters onto the table.	[]
Token	4	0	Oh! Sure, that works.	[]
Cartman	10	0	You guys! You guys, listen to this! It's amazing!	[]
Kyle	2	0	What dude?	[]
Cartman	8	0	We just received a letter from the WWE.	[]
Stan	8	0	From the professional wrestlers we saw in Denver?	[]
Butters	2	0	No way!	[]
Cartman	43	0	Gentlemen, We have heard of your wrestling federation and are quite interested in its popularity. The WWE is delighted to inform you that it will be sending a talent scout, President Vince McMahon to view your wrestling event this Saturday the twenty-fourth.	[]
Stan	7	0	Vince McMahon is coming to see us?	[]
Kyle	14	0	This is our shot at making it into the WWE. To be real wrestlers.	[]
Stan	11	0	Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod!..	[]
Kyle	6	0	Oh my God... Oh my God...	[]
Token	7	0	I can't believe it's him.	[]
Butters	4	0	I'm freaking out...	[]
Kyle	3	0	Omigod! Omigod! Omigod!	[]
Cartman	35	0	Okay guys! Guys, listen! We seriously have to focus here! We have exactly three days before the scout is here to see us wrestle. We gotta step it up and work it like never before.	[]
Stan	25	0	Alright it's time to start the second act. Let's bring the crowd back in from intermission and then improvise some stuff for Saturday!	[]
Other	18	0	Yeah, no I I think Congo is a great wrestler; I just think Rad Russian has his number.	[]
Other	10	0	Yeah, but Rad Russian has a lot of abandonment issues.	[]
Other	12	0	Uh oh, it looks like the intermission is over, better head back.	[]
Kyle	30	0	I left my wife today. Walked out of the apartment without saying a word. I ran away from my responsibilities... just like I always do.  And I, again, am alone.	[]
Stan	11	0	Here he is, hiding in the forest as I told you.	[]
Butters	19	0	Juggernaut! There is to be an Ultimate Smackdown this Saturday! Are you going to run from that as well?	[]
Kyle	5	0	I'll fight anytime, anywhere!	[]
Other	9	0	He don't run from fights, just from responsibilities.	[]
Other	2	0	Oohhhhh!  Boooooooo!	[]
Stan	18	0	What do I do? Juggernaut is my long lost brother.  And yet Congo saved my life in Nam.	[]
Other	5	0	It's El Pollo Loco!	[]
Cartman	18	0	Thanks for coming, guys. I'm sure you're wondering why I've called you here to Sizzler.	[]
Kyle	13	0	Yeah, what's this about? We should be writing our monologues for Smackdown.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Well guys, Kenny and I have been talking.	[]
Kenny	5	0	(Yeah, we've been talking.)	[]
Cartman	26	0	And, I mean, Smackdown might be our one shot at making it into the WWE, right? I mean a shot like this might never come again.	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah?	[]
Cartman	20	0	Well, the way we see it, we have three primary obstacles in making Smackdown a great show: Token, Butters, Jimmy.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Yep.)	[]
Kyle	5	0	What are you talking about?	[]
Cartman	46	1	Guys, let's face it: they can't wrestle for crap! I mean, every time I wrestle with one of them, they flub a line or blow their monologue. And Token? He has no emotion, no timing, he's the worst wrestler I've ever seen!	['crap']
Stan	3	0	He's right.	[]
Kyle	1	0	What?	[]
Stan	16	0	Dude, it's really hard to do your best wrestling when you're up against Token.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Right?	[]
Stan	19	0	And Butters and Jimmy I mean, they're okay but, they're never gonna make it as professional wrestlers.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Well, so then WWE will recruit us and not them.	[]
Cartman	8	0	No dude, they're gonna hurt our chances.	[]
Kenny	6	0	(They're gonna hurt our chances.)	[]
Cartman	24	0	Because we all know that the new material I've written is stuff those guys can't handle, and we'll suffer from it!	[]
Kyle	5	0	So what do we do?	[]
Kenny	7	0	(We've gotta bring somebody else on.)	[]
Cartman	24	0	Yep. We've gotta bring somebody else on who can handle the more difficult roles that we can wrestle against instead of those guys.	[]
Stan	20	0	Somebody who can do the harder stuff we've written so that Token, Butters, and Jimmy can have smaller parts.	[]
Kyle	10	0	How do we find somebody who can wrestle that well?	[]
Cartman	8	0	It's simple. We just gotta hold tryouts.	[]
Cartman	28	0	Number seventeen step forward, please?  You're wrestling a Muslim immigrant. You suspect he could be a terrorist and your parrents died in the 9/11 attacks. Go!	[]
Other	35	1	You dirty Muslim bastard! I don't trust you, and I never will! Do you know how it feels to lose your parents?! No you wouldn't, you smelly brown Middle Eastern piece of sh-	['bastard']
Cartman	27	1	Thank you! Number twenty-four?  You're wrestling for the right to marry Mackenzie Phillips, but just learned that she had sex with her father uh, go!	['sex']
Other	17	1	Your father! Your own father!  I don't care if you were on drugs, you sick! Whore!	['whore']
Cartman	2	0	Thank you.	[]
Kyle	7	0	That guy's a pretty good wrestler.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Mhm.)	[]
Stan	4	0	Yeah yeah, not bad.	[]
Cartman	32	0	Let's see uh, can we get number thirty seven to step forward again.  We just wanna get to know you all a little better. What can you tell us about yourself?	[]
Other	96	0	Not a whole lot to tell, really. Was born in Fort Collins, started watching wrestling when I was four years old. My father... he liked it too. Until he died.  Sometimes I think it's 'cause of him I followed this dream.  All my life, all I ever wanted was to Beeeee a wrestler Fiiiiighting in the ring Winning that belt. And so I dreamed every night that I was the Uuuuundertaaker Smaaaaashing skulls in Breaking arms. But I'm so worked up. This is something I can do. Do I have what it takes inside?	[]
Stan	7	1	Damn dude, that is some badass wrestling.	['damn']
Cartman	4	0	Yeah, this guy crushes.	[]
Other	37	0	It isn't fair. All my hard work.  I'm not going to take it anymore.  That wrestling show is in for a big surprise.  I'm putting an end to this once and for all!  Hyaaaaa!	[]
Kyle	7	0	He's here! Vince McMahon is here!	[]
Other	5	0	Oowow, it's really him.	[]
Stan	16	0	He's here, Ohh my God  Omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod o-	[]
Cartman	3	0	Alright, places everyone.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Welcome to this performance of Wrestling Takedown Federation: Smackdown.	[]
Stan	7	0	Juggernaut? Juggernaut, hey, what's goin' on?	[]
Kyle	19	0	You know what's goin' on. It's Smackdown tonight. Which means we might have to fight each other.	[]
Stan	12	0	Heyhey whoa, you shouldn't be fighting anybody. What about your cancer?	[]
Kyle	6	0	Wait a minute. Who is that?	[]
Stan	8	0	It's Triceratops, and he's with Irene.	[]
Kyle	6	0	You aren't welcome here, Triceratops!	[]
Cartman	7	0	My man can do whatever he wants.	[]
Other	9	0	Stay calm, you know what you have to do.	[]
Cartman	9	0	You're just gonna have to deal with that.	[]
Other	6	0	For the good of real wrassling.	[]
Butters	11	0	No Irene, please! Just this once, do not abort this baby!	[]
Cartman	25	0	My body, my rights! In fact, I'm jonesing for the rush so badly, I don't think I'll make it to the clinic.	[]
Stan	7	0	No, you can't possibly mean that-!	[]
Cartman	13	0	Yes! I think maybe I'll have another abortion! Right here, right now!	[]
Other	1	0	Awwwww!	[]
Butters	21	0	There's someone here to wrestle you, Irene! A baby you aborted many years ago survived! And he's here now!	[]
Other	7	0	Mother! Why did you abort me? Why?	[]
Other	3	0	He's alive!	[]
Cartman	9	0	You! Get back in the trashcan where you belong!	[]
Other	4	0	What do you thnk?	[]
Stan	19	0	Irene, there's no way we could let you here, and I'd let you something informal like that.	[]
Other	17	0	They are decent wrestlers. We'll see how they develop their through lines in the second act.	[]
Other	9	0	Aha! I thought I would find you here, Triceratops!	[]
Butters	14	0	Stay out of my business Sergeant Hammerclaw! You just stay out of my way!	[]
Other	13	0	Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm afraid this area is off limits	[]
Butters	3	0	Are you sure?	[]
Other	10	0	Oh don't mind me.  I was just about to-	[]
Other	12	2	Heh whoa-ho! Heh hey! Whoawhoawhoa. Whoahoho. Eheheh. The fuck is this?	['ho', 'fuck']
Cartman	14	0	O, how I long for the spring meadows of Russia! The soft Russian sky!	[]
Stan	21	0	When are you going to face reality, Congo? Just because you were raised by panthers doesn't mean you are one!	[]
Butters	11	0	He's closer to a panther than you'll ever be!	[]
Other	31	0	Lies! These are all a bunch of lies!  Now you listen here, El, Pollo Loco! It doesn't matter if your wife was killed, you cannot keep Irene's aborted baby!	[]
Kenny	5	0	(I can keep the baby...)	[]
Cartman	42	0	Just let them crawl back to Mexico Sergeant Hammerclaw.  We can't... might as well go back to your land of burritos, tacos, and take this aborted baby where it will fit in right with all the other aborted babies in Mexico!	[]
Other	25	1	Only one shot.  Maximum damage.  This is all your fault, you WWE president asshole! Your fault we all die here. Right. Now. FOR WRASSLING!  NO!	['asshole']

Other	2	0	Huh? What?	[]
Other	4	0	They took his job.	[]
Other	3	0	I know. Sshh.	[]
Other	32	0	You want to know pain? Pain is dedicating your entire life to a sport, to a career, and then having it all ripped away from you like a babe from its mother.	[]
Other	6	0	Oh man, they took his job?	[]
Other	4	0	They took hid-drr.	[]
