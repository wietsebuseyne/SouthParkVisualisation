Other	28	0	Our factory works 24/7 to produce candy, and we have over 500 employees. Here you can see where the cocoa is mixed with the sugar and milk.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Wow, coo'..  Chocolate rules!	[]
Kyle	4	0	You should know, fatass.	[]
Cartman	8	2	AY! I'm not fat, you sneaky Jew!	['fat', 'jew']
Stan	7	0	Oh God, you guys, really? This again?	[]
Other	18	0	And here is where all the fudge is put into boxes to be shipped all over the world.	[]
Kyle	9	0	Kinda like Cartman's dad shipped out on him.	[]
Cartman	10	1	I have a dad, butthole. My mom is my dad.	['butthole']
Stan	14	0	You guys stop! All you're doing is rehashing a bunch of old stuff!	[]
Butters	7	0	Hey Stan, isn't that Tom Cruise?	[]
Stan	16	0	Huh?  Oh wow it is! Hey guys check it out, Tom Cruise is a fudge packer!	[]
Other	5	0	What did you call me?	[]
Cartman	5	0	Hey, that is Tom Cruise!	[]
Butters	8	0	How come you're packin' fudge, Mr. Cruise?	[]
Other	6	0	I'm not a fudge packer!	[]
Kyle	10	0	Dude, you don't have to be ashamed or anything.	[]
Other	7	0	But I'm not a fudge packer!	[]
Stan	6	0	Then why are you packing fudge?	[]
Other	23	0	I'm not. I am a very busy actor who is trying to get away for a week and do some fly fishing!	[]
Stan	9	0	Dude, you are in a fudge factory packing fudge.	[]
Other	8	0	Oh, that does it. I will SUE you!	[]
Stan	2	0	For what?	[]
Other	14	0	You can't just call somebody a fudge packer and get away with it!	[]
Mr. Garrison	7	0	Hey, is that fudge-packer Tom Cruise?	[]
Other	10	0	That's it!  I'm suing this entire intolerant town!	[]
Stan	2	0	But dude-	[]
Other	18	1	No buts! If you want to accuse somebody of being a fudgepacker, you're gonna pay the consequences!	['fudgepacker']
Other	32	0	Guys, I want to really thank you all for coming. Shockingly, I've just been slandered once again in the town of South Park, something I know you can all relate to.	[]
Other	12	0	That town just seems to be a hotbed of hatred and lies!	[]
Other	15	1	I'm fed up with it. That town suggested that I was made of shit!	['shit']
Other	40	0	Yeah, well I was just over there doing a little fly fishing and this little boy walks up and calls me a fudge packer!  I know, right? And then other kids in the town and their teacher start joining in.	[]
Other	14	0	South Park, Colorado, is the most racist, insensitive, and bigoted place in this country!	[]
Other	16	0	That place thinks they can say whatever they want about us and get away with it!	[]
Other	11	1	If anyone has a gripe against that shithole, it's me!	['shithole']
Other	35	0	Yeah, well I say enough. All of us together can put a stop to that slander coming from that town once and for all! No longer will they make snide remarks about whoever they want.	[]
Other	1	0	YEAH!	[]
Other	11	0	Hey, Tom. I ate too much Subway. Where's your bathroom?	[]
Other	44	0	Oh, just the door down the hall there, Jared.  No, no, no, that's a closet. Go down more.  No that's a closet too.  Nope, Jared. That's a closet too.  No.  That's a closet... No that- that's a closet too.	[]
Other	15	0	Stan Marsh, to the principal's office. Stan Marsh to the principal's office immediately!	[]
Kyle	5	0	Dude, what did you do?	[]
Stan	4	0	I have no idea...	[]
Randy	20	0	You just had to push it, didn't you Stan. You just had to make fun of Tom Cruise again!	[]
Other	7	0	Did you call him a fudge packer?	[]
Stan	5	0	Aww... he was packing fudge!	[]
Other	24	0	Little boy, you don't understand how serious this is. Tom Cruise has put together a class-action lawsuit, along with 200 other celebrities!	[]
Mr. Mackey	14	0	They are going to sue the bejezzus out of this entire town, m'kay!	[]
Stan	15	0	It wasn't just me. Other kids called him a fudge packer, even Mr. Gar-	[]
Other	12	0	But you started it. Mr. Broflovski, tell him what you told us.	[]
Other	20	0	Stan, a class-action lawsuit means the end of this town. We can't possibly go up against their lawyers!	[]
Other	15	1	Dammit Marsh, why couldn't you have just kept your stupid ugly son in line!	['dammit']
Randy	9	0	Hey, don't start blaming me for his looks!	[]
Randy	19	0	Mr. Cruise. My son is so, so sorry and he would do anything to take back his hurtful comments.	[]
Other	15	0	That's nice!  I'm still suing you all! Nobody calls me a fudge packer!	[]
Randy	23	0	Yes, it was a terrible mistake. But maybe you could see how, since you do... take fudge and... pack it into a box...	[]
Other	1	0	WHAT?	[]
Randy	16	0	We-, I-I'm just saying that you are employed currently as a person who... packages...	[]
Other	9	0	I am an actor. I do not pack fudge!	[]
Randy	50	0	Right, my son just got confused. Because you have a little uniform, and a... hat that says Fred's Fudge and Candies... and you are... Look it doesn't matter. Just please withdraw the class-action lawsuit. Nobody in our town will ever call you a fudge packer ever again.	[]
Other	18	0	Well, there is... one thing that your town could do to... maybe make me forget about this lawsuit.	[]
Randy	6	0	ANYTHING! anything you want Mr. Cruise.	[]
Other	28	0	It's just that there's somebody that I have always wanted to meet... face to face. If you could get him to show up in your town-	[]
Randy	10	0	Sure! Who is it, we can get anybody for you.	[]
Other	7	0	Muhammad. The prophet of the Muslim faith.	[]
Stan	1	0	Ooooooo...	[]
Randy	3	0	That's... tricky...	[]
Other	7	0	Well then you can just get sued!	[]
Randy	13	0	Mr. Cruise, if there is anybody else we could bring to town, we-	[]
Other	14	0	No! Just him. You get Muhammad to appear or your little town is DONE!	[]
Randy	27	0	Okay people, I know, I know. But he will get the other celebrities to withdraw their lawsuit if we just... get Muhammad to appear in South Park.	[]
Mr. Garrison	12	1	Are you nuts? If Muhammad appears in South Park, we get bombed!	['nuts']
Other	21	0	Now we don't know that. Maybe enough time has passed that it is now OK to show Muhammad in public.	[]
Kyle	13	0	Dude, I can't believe we are dealing with this Muhammad thing again.	[]
Mr. Mackey	17	0	But even if it were safe for Muhammad to be shown, how would we ever find him?	[]
Other	20	0	Yeah, showing an image of him is completely off limits and censored, so nobody has seen what Muhammad looks like.	[]
Stan	4	0	I saw him once.	[]
Other	2	0	You did?	[]
Stan	32	0	Yeah, one time, my friends joined David Blaine's cult, and I had to go to the Super Best Friends to rescue them, and Muhammad was one of the Super Best Friends.	[]
Mr. Garrison	19	0	Oh, and what- he was just out in the open where everybody could see him and nobody got bombed?	[]
Stan	6	0	No, dude, it was totally fine.	[]
Other	10	0	Muhammad showed up and there was no violence at all?	[]
Stan	9	0	Well, a giant John Wilkes Booth shot Abraham Lincoln...	[]
Randy	42	0	Alright Stan, that's enough. Jesus, can't learn to shut up, can you? Now look, I believe we CAN find Muhammad. I have done a lot of research and I have completed a sketch of what Muhammad might look like today.	[]
Mr. Garrison	8	0	No, don't!  Is that okay to show?	[]
Other	9	0	I don't know. I guess we'll see.	[]
Other	13	0	Tom, what is up with this Muhammad thing? It doesn't make sense!	[]
Other	9	0	Yeah, you said we were just suing South Park.	[]
Other	41	0	No, I said we were going to use South Park to make sure we never got ripped on again. Look people, all of us get ridiculed, but who is the one person on this earth who is completely free from slander?	[]
Other	9	0	You want Muhammad because he can't be ridiculed?	[]
Other	40	0	Muhammad has a power that makes him impervious to being made fun of. What if we could harness that power?  Jimmy Buffet, how would you like it if no-one could ever call your music drunken frat boy monkey garbage?	[]
Other	5	0	I... I'd love it!	[]
Other	93	2	By taking what Muhammad has, we could all be safe from ridicule.  Like Tim Burton here. Imagine it Tim; nobody could rip on you for all the rehashed movies you've made lately. There'd never be a TV show that pointed out that you have never had an original idea since Beetlejuice. And, you put Johnny Depp and all the same crappy music in every film. And if you're that in love with Johnny Depp, then you should just have sex with him already. A TV show could never say that!	['crappy', 'sex']
Other	5	0	Gee, that'd be swell.	[]
Other	17	0	Well it can be a reality. Once we have Muhammad, we can take that power from him.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Excuse me...  This is the home of Tom Cruise, right?	[]
Other	13	0	Hey! It's one of the boys from South Park who slandered me!	[]
Cartman	21	0	I didn't come for myself. I just came as an escort for another celebrity who wants in on your lawsuit...	[]
Other	1	0	Who?	[]
Other	1	0	Alllloooo...	[]
Other	2	0	Jennifer Lopez!	[]
Other	11	0	Yes, I am Hennifer Lopez, and I like tacos and burritos.	[]
Other	33	0	In the great hall of the Super Best Friends, there are assembled the leaders of the world's greatest religions; Jesus!  Buddha!  Krishna!  Muhammad!  Lao Tzu and Joseph Smith  and... the mighty Semen!	[]
Other	7	0	It's not semen, it's Seaman!	[]
Other	12	0	Their mission; right that which is wrong, and to serve all mankind.	[]
Stan	18	0	Jesus, all we are asking you to do is bring Muhammad to our town for like an hour.	[]
Jesus	15	0	My son, much has changed since you were last here. Muhammad cannot make public appearances.	[]
Other	10	0	We simply cannot risk any violence from the Muslim people	[]
Stan	8	1	Awww, not you guys too... Jesus fucking Christ!	['fucking']
Other	9	0	Back in the hall of the Super Best Friends...	[]
Kyle	16	0	Okay, will you let Muhammad come to South Park if we dress him like a pirate?	[]
Other	11	0	No, Muslims would still be angry if you showed his face.	[]
Kyle	11	0	K... what if we cover his face with a paper bag?	[]
Other	15	0	No, cause you would still be showing him walking around, that could be a-trouble.	[]
Stan	20	0	Okay. A suit of armor? We just have Muhammad in a suit of armor so you can't see anything.	[]
Jesus	10	0	But it's still Muhammad walking around in human form.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Aww come on! This is ridiculous!	[]
Other	20	0	Boys, you need to understand that people get very offended when Muhammad is mocked because he is a religious figure.	[]
Jesus	9	0	Buddha, don't do coke in front of kids!	[]
Kyle	27	0	A U-Haul. What if we bring Muhammad to South Park in the back of a U-Haul, and he just stays in there out of sight?	[]
Other	8	0	But he's talking from the U-Haul?	[]
Stan	14	0	Well yeah, he's got to talk or nobody knows he's in there!	[]
Jesus	12	0	Hearing his voice, I don't know. What do you think Moses?	[]
Other	9	0	Um... would there be windows on the U-Haul?	[]
Kyle	6	0	There doesn't have to be...	[]
Other	9	0	Um... I guess... I guess that would be okay.	[]
Other	21	0	Here it is friends. Once we have Muhammad, this machine will give us the power to not be made fun of.	[]
Other	20	0	Tom, Tom, you're talkin' crazy mate. Only Muhammad has that ability, how could we ever get it from him?	[]
Other	11	0	We take his goo! It's as simple as that friends.	[]
Other	16	0	Rob Reiner has been telling me about the goo that is inside every person on earth.	[]
Other	15	0	Any goo can be harvested from a person's body, and easily placed into another.	[]
Cartman	17	0	Wait, wait, wait, you mean we aren't going to sue and get a bunch of money?	[]
Other	8	0	No Jen, we all have got enough money.	[]
Other	16	0	Yes, who needs more money, we need to get Muhammad's goo! Yes, yes, ariva ariva!	[]
Cartman	6	0	Uh, excuse us for a second...	[]
Cartman	11	1	Alright, just what the hell do you think you are doing?	['hell']
Other	9	0	What am I doing? Just having some fun, cholo!	[]
Cartman	11	1	Cut the crap, I thought we were here for lawsuit money!	['crap']
Other	11	0	Just keep your mouth shut, and do what I tell you!	[]
Cartman	25	0	If we are staying here, then I want to know what is going on. Don't forget, I know who you really are...  Mitch Conner.	[]
Other	15	0	If you know what's good for you, you'll keep your mouth shut, kid.	[]
Cartman	18	0	You're a no-good swindler and a 2-bit thief. We were here for money, not goo!	[]
Other	22	0	Think about it. Muhammad is the only person in the world who can't get ripped on. Those celebrities want his goo.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Yeah, so what?	[]
Other	27	1	You know what the goo is worth on the open market? Hell, I got people in Hong Kong who'll give me 50 mil for that goo.	['hell']
Cartman	14	0	So we let them take it from Muhammad, then we take it for ourselves.	[]
Other	5	0	You catch on quick kid...	[]
Other	2	0	Mrs. Lopez...	[]
Other	6	0	Hurry, get my wig back on!	[]
Other	17	0	Hey, I was just seeing if you needed some- Oh, god  you found my fudge packing uniform...	[]
Other	8	0	Oh, your secret is safe with me, Tommy!	[]
Randy	14	0	Boys, we are so sorry for doubting you. You really did bring us Muhammad.	[]
Other	7	0	Thank you so much for coming, Muhammad.	[]
Other	3	0	You're welcome.	[]
Other	4	0	Oh, is that okay?	[]
Other	4	0	I don't know.	[]
Randy	23	0	Alright, now we just need to figure out how to get Muhammad from the back of the truck into Tom Cruise's limo.	[]
Stan	16	0	What! No, dad. we promised the Super Best Friends that Muhammad would stay in the truck.	[]
Other	20	0	Cruise's lawyers were very specific boys. He's sending a limo for Muhammad to meet him outside of town.	[]
Kyle	7	0	But Muhammad can't be seen dad.	[]
Other	8	0	Alright, we'll put a sheet over him.	[]
Stan	8	0	No, you can't even show his feet.	[]
Other	11	0	How about a Halloween costume with one of those plastic masks?	[]
Mr. Garrison	7	0	No, you could still see his eyes...	[]
Randy	22	0	Okay. How 'bout like... like a big mascot outfit? One that covered him completely, head to toe, without even showing his eyes?	[]
Other	5	0	Muhammad, would that be OK?	[]
Other	1	0	OK.	[]
Other	19	0	Tom, Rob, we've just received word from the lawyers. South Park is saying they have Muhammad for us!	[]
Other	6	0	Rob, will the machine be ready?	[]
Other	5	0	Oh, it'll be ready!	[]
Other	2	0	More tacos!	[]
Other	2	0	More tacos!	[]
Cartman	6	0	No! No more tacos Mrs. Lopez.	[]
Other	2	0	More tacos.	[]
Cartman	5	0	You just had seven tacos.	[]
Other	4	0	I want more tacos!	[]
Cartman	8	0	I'm sorry  Why are you doing this?	[]
Other	9	0	I am Jennifer Lopez, I need tacos to live!	[]
Cartman	14	1	You know goddamn well you are not Jennifer Lopez, so stop pissing me off!	['goddamn']
Other	12	0	Mrs. Lopez, I can go. What do you want, like three tacos?	[]
Other	10	0	Oh, thank you 'harlie Sheeeeen. And maybe an enchirito too?	[]
Cartman	9	0	Aw- Jee-. They don't even make enchiritos anymore!	[]
Other	3	0	Yes they do!	[]
Cartman	6	0	I tried getting one last week!	[]
Other	11	0	Not all Taco Bells have enchiritos, but some still carry them.	[]
Cartman	6	0	God, will somebody shut her up?	[]
Randy	11	0	Alright, the limo's here. Muhammad, thanks again for doing this.	[]
Other	9	0	You've done this town a huge favor Muhammad.	[]
Mr. Garrison	4	0	Hold on a second!	[]
Mr. Garrison	22	0	Stop! There are some extremists! They are threatening that if we give Muhammad to the celebrities, they are going to bomb us!	[]
Other	1	0	What?!	[]
Randy	21	0	Aw. Aw it's just a stupid threat! Come on Muhammad, we don't want to piss off Tom Cruise again.	[]
Other	5	0	Alright, we got him Tom.	[]
Stan	4	0	Muhammad, are you okay?	[]
Randy	5	1	What the hell was that?!	['hell']
Other	41	0	Obviously the terrorists are for real!  What does that paper say?  We have placed bombs all over your city. You will give Muhammad to us. The celebrities want Muhammad for his power not to be ridiculed. We want that power... huzzah.	[]
Stan	4	0	They want his power?	[]
Kyle	6	0	What kind of extremists are these?	[]
Other	5	0	You won't believe it...	[]
Other	13	1	Our time is near! Soon, gingers will never be made fun of again!	['gingers']
Other	1	0	Huzzah!	[]
Other	9	1	Where the hell do you think you're going?	['hell']
Cartman	18	0	I'm through with your stupid plans, Conner! I've got better things to do with my time.	[]
Other	7	0	You gonna walk away from 50 mil?	[]
Cartman	3	0	Let me by...	[]
Other	14	0	You walk away now, and you will regret it the rest of your life.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Screw this Conner.  Find yourself another partner.	[]
Other	11	0	Then I guess I won't tell you about your father.	[]
Cartman	2	0	My father...	[]
Other	13	0	Thought that might get your attention. You know nothing about your dad, right?	[]
Cartman	14	0	I know enough, my mother is a hermaphrodite, so she is actually my father.	[]
Other	26	0	You really still believe that garbage? The people in your town sold you that line. Come on, you've had to have doubted it all along.	[]
Cartman	10	0	How could you know anything about who my family is?	[]
Other	41	0	Heh. I know all about the swindles and schemes in this dead-end town. You got lied to kid. By the people who were closest to you. I can prove it too, but I'm going to want something in return.	[]
Cartman	15	0	If you're making this up to keep me around Conner, the you'd better-	[]
Other	23	0	You just take me where I tell you, and when you learn the truth, you will learn to trust me. And nobody else...	[]
Other	12	0	Okay people, let's try to evacuate in an orderly fashion. Geez.	[]
Other	17	0	Mayor, we do not have the resources to deal with this situation! A full evacuation is impossible!	[]
Other	7	0	Jesus, what are we supposed to do?!	[]
Other	8	0	We have to give in to their demands.	[]
Other	16	1	I'm sorry Muhammad, but we are going to have to give you over the gingers.	['gingers']
Kyle	9	1	We can't give him over to the gingers!	['gingers']
Stan	9	0	Yeah, we said we'd take care of him.	[]
Other	9	0	But our homes and our lives are at stake.	[]
Stan	6	0	We made a promise... to Jesus!	[]
Randy	9	0	Stan, Jesus doesn't matter when Muhammad is involved.	[]
Other	5	0	That'll be Tom Cruise...	[]
Randy	1	0	Helllo?	[]
Other	5	0	Yeah, so whats going on?	[]
Randy	15	0	Uh... I'm afraid we can't... well, we can't give Muhammad to you.	[]
Other	11	0	What do you mean, you're not givin' him to us?!	[]
Randy	21	1	There are these ginger fundamentalists saying that if we don't give Muhammad to them, they are going to bomb us.	['ginger']
Other	1	1	Gingers?	['gingers']
Other	4	2	Gingers? Aww, hell no.	['gingers', 'hell']
Randy	10	0	Please, understand that we have no choice here Mr. Cruise.	[]
Other	19	1	You're going to give Muhammad to gingers instead of us, just because they are threatening you with violence?	['gingers']
Randy	2	0	Well, yeah.	[]
Other	16	0	Oh, we can play that game too! You want to see violence, well you got it!	[]
Other	39	2	Goddamn stupid assholes! You want to play rough?! OK! Spielburg, go and get some automatic rifles! We'll go in there, and we're going to take  Muhammad by force! And then we are going to show them th-	['goddamn', 'assholes']
Other	9	0	Tom, Tom. We can't be seen getting violent.	[]
Other	7	0	Yeah, that would kill all our careers!	[]
Other	23	1	But the only way we are going to get Muhammad from South Park now is by getting just as violent as the gingers!	['gingers']
Other	8	0	Fine, then let's have Her do it.	[]
Other	2	0	Her who?	[]
Other	3	0	You know... Her.	[]
Other	3	0	Oh right...  Her.	[]
Other	6	1	There she is Tom... Barbra Streisand.	['streisand']
Other	10	0	My God, she's even more terrifying than I remember.	[]
Other	19	1	Tom, Barbra Streisand hasn't been active for a long time. Are we sure we want to do this?	['streisand']
Other	23	1	Mrs. Streisand got torn apart in the town of South Park. She's probably more angry at that town than any of us.	['streisand']
Other	6	0	Power her up! Release the Kraken!	[]
Other	7	0	Hey Barbra. It's me, Rob Reiner.	[]
Other	17	0	Listen, Babs, we are taking on the town of South Park and we really need your help	[]
Other	12	1	We figured you're pissed at South Park too, right Mrs. Streisand?	['streisand']
Other	6	0	Oh, she's pissed all right.	[]
Mr. Garrison	6	0	Eric, what are you doing here?	[]
Cartman	21	0	Did you all lie to me? All of you, in that room, when you told me my mother was my father?	[]
Mr. Garrison	14	0	What? N-No Eric, are you still worried about that old issue, I mean-	[]
Cartman	12	0	I don't trust you. I want to talk to Mr. Hat.	[]
Mr. Garrison	12	0	Eric, I haven't used Mr. Hat in a long time, and-	[]
Cartman	5	0	I said GET. Mr. Hat!	[]
Cartman	6	0	Put it on!  Do the voice.	[]
Other	7	0	Hello kids, it's me, Mr. Hat.	[]
Other	10	0	Good to see you Hat. Helluva night, isn't it?	[]
Other	8	0	I... I don't believe I know you.	[]
Other	15	0	The name's Mitch Conner, I flew the same division as you back in Saigon.	[]
Mr. Garrison	10	0	Eric, this is silly, why don't we just stop-	[]
Cartman	4	0	Keep... your hand... UP!	[]
Randy	12	1	Alright gingers, we have Muhammad for you, now hand over the detonators.	['gingers']
Other	21	0	Nuh uh, first you gotta prove that that is still Muhammad in there! Have him step out of the bear costume...	[]
Other	1	0	Ohhhhhhh...	[]
Stan	6	0	Dude, we can't do that	[]
Other	10	0	Show us it's Muhammad or South Park is finished!	[]
Other	11	1	Dammit Mitch, you're asking questions that shouldn't be answered!	['dammit']
Other	9	0	So you admit it. There was a cover up.	[]
Mr. Garrison	8	0	No Mr. Hat, don't say any more!	[]
Other	5	0	Yeah, tell 'im whatcha know!	[]
Other	20	0	Alright Eric, your father was in the room the day of your DNA test, but the results were... tampered with.	[]
Cartman	8	1	By who? Goddammit Garrison, who is my father?	['goddammit']
