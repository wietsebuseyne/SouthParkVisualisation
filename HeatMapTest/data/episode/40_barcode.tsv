Kenny	3	0	(What's that?)	[]
Kyle	43	2	It's what we do in Jew Scouts. Usually we just sit around and make stuff. But tonight, because there's a meteor shower, we're gonna do some big thing out in the woods. It's gonna suck ass, I'm sure.	['jew', 'ass']
Kenny	4	0	(Oh, that's alright.)	[]

Other	11	0	Enough, elder! You will not speak the name of Haman here!	[]

Other	6	0	We pray to Moses here, elder.	[]
Other	13	0	If you guys love Moses so much, why don't you marry him?!	[]
Other	31	0	We accept all denominations of Judaism here at Scouts, elder, but your synagogue of anti-Semites is too strange! Get out and do not return: you are no longer welcome here!	[]
Other	64	1	Fine!  Jewbilee is the time of Haman! You will all see how wrong you are, very soon! When Haman returns from the Ninth Tower of Disillusionment, and smotes Moses and all his followers into pillars of dust that would cry for their petty lives but can't, having recently been turned into dust and all, you will see!
