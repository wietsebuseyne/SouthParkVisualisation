Stan	4	0	Oh, cool. A preview.	[]
Other	49	0	Coming this summer , it's the classic film that changed America. E.T.: The Extraterrestrial, the new, redone version for 2002.  All the E.T. effects have been digitally upgraded.  All the guns have been digitally changed to walkie-talkies. And the word TERRORIST has been changed to HIPPIE.	[]
Stan	7	0	Aw, dude, why would they do that?	[]
Cartman	8	0	Yeah, hippies and terrorists are the same thing.	[]
Kyle	15	0	No, dude. They only changed terrorist to hippie to make E.T. more P.C.	[]
Stan	3	1	That's gay.	['gay']
Other	40	0	Coming this summer, it's the motion picture that changed America. Saving Private Ryan, the RE-RE-RELEASE, where the word NAZI has been changed to PERSONS WITH POLITICAL DIFFERENCES, and all their guns have been replaced by walkie-talkies.	[]
Stan	10	1	Why the hell do these directors keep updating their movies?	['hell']
Other	19	0	And now, for your feature presentation: the classic RE-RE-RE-RELEASE of Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back	[]
Other	1	0	Woohoo!	[]
Other	23	0	In the version, the word WOOKIE has been changed to HAIR CHALLENGED ANIMAL and the entire cast has been digitally replaced by Ewoks.	[]
Other	1	0	AWWWW!!!	[]
Stan	5	1	Goddamnit, that pissed me off!	['goddamnit']
Cartman	6	0	Yeah, we want our money back!	[]
Other	2	1	Sorry, suckers!	['suckers']
Cartman	2	1	You asshole!	['asshole']
Kyle	15	0	Why don't they leave those movies alone? We liked them the way they were!	[]
Other	26	0	Don't you see what this means? All our favorite movies are going to be changed, and updated, until we can't even recognize them anymore.	[]
Stan	29	1	Tweek is right. It isn't fair for those asshole directors to keep changing their movies and making them different! Movies are art, and art shouldn't be modified!	['asshole']
Kyle	20	1	Yeah, what if they had modified the Roman Coliseum every year? It would just be another big douchey stadium now.	['douchey']
Stan	10	0	We have to do something. Let's form a club.	[]
Cartman	24	0	Yeah! We can form a club that takes food stamps from poor people and then sells them back to the government for a profit.	[]
Stan	19	0	No, fatass! I mean a club to protect films from their directors, so they can't be messed with!	[]
Kyle	12	0	Yeah. We'll be the Save Films From Their Own Directors club	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah	[]
Other	43	0	NO! Nono, ah I don't wanna form a club! That's too much pressure! Look, ah-I'm supposed to take it easy; just, watch the clouds, sit on the grass. And, if we form a club there'll be responsibilites. Commitments!	[]
Cartman	22	1	Tweek, now Goddamnit, we picked you to be our new friend to replace Kenny because we thought you were a team player!	['goddamnit']
Other	9	0	I'm not! I'm not a team player!	[]
Cartman	15	1	Now, either you stop with these faggotronics or we'll find someone to replace YOU!	['faggotronics']
Other	5	1	D'oh-ho! Oh Jesus!	['ho']
Cartman	9	0	Dude, that sign sucks! Nobody's gonna show up!	[]
Stan	6	0	Well what's wrong with it?	[]
Cartman	29	1	Look at it, dude. You're not offering any fabulous prizes. You have to offer fabulous prizes if you want people to show up for your stupid crap. Here.	['crap']
Kyle	2	0	Free hat?	[]
Cartman	12	0	Yeah, if you offer free hats, m-maybe people will show up.	[]
Other	6	0	But we don't have hats!	[]
Cartman	9	0	Well we can just make them out of paper.	[]
Other	1	0	Aahh!	[]
Cartman	23	0	It's not hard, it's just a stupid little paper hat. People just need free stuff - don't you guys know anything?!	[]
Other	19	0	You see?? First we were just forming a club, now we have to make hats! When does it end??	[]
Stan	14	0	Alright, let's go get the gymnasium ready. Tweek, you go make fifty hats.	[]
Other	4	0	Fifty hats? Oh Jesus!	[]
Other	11	0	Ah! I'll never make it! I'll never make it!	[]
Other	1	0	Tweek!	[]
Other	1	0	Hrrr!	[]
Other	12	0	Calm down, son. Remember what Dr. Norris told you. Find your center.	[]
Other	6	0	My center. My... center.  Calm  Cup?	[]
Cartman	3	0	Tweek!  TWEEK!!  TWEEK!!	[]
Other	1	0	Gaaaaah!	[]
Cartman	6	0	How many hats have you made?	[]
Other	2	0	Oh God!	[]
Cartman	12	0	We only have until 10 a.m. tomorrow!  Get the lead out!	[]
Other	3	0	Aaaah! Oh God!	[]
Other	7	0	You guys, we have a big problem!	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Other	25	0	I was up, all night, making hats. I only slept for an hour, ...and then I dreamt about making hats, but I only made fifteen!	[]
Kyle	7	0	Calm down, Tweek. Fifteen might be enough.	[]
Stan	20	0	Yeah, let's see if anyone has even shown up yet.  Dude, there's like a thousand people in there!	[]
Other	13	0	A thousand?  Oh Jesus man! I don't have nearly a thousand hats!	[]
Cartman	7	1	Then I'mo kick your ass, Tweek!	['ass']
Other	1	0	Goohoo!	[]
Kyle	27	0	Wait. It's okay. Look, maybe these people all turned out because they believe in saving films. Maybe they don't even care about the free hats.	[]
Other	6	0	Free hat!  Free hat! Free hat!	[]
Other	2	0	Oh God!	[]
Cartman	12	0	I told you guys: never underestimate the power of a free hat.	[]
Other	4	0	Free hat! Free hat!	[]
Other	6	0	I gotta move away, you guys!	[]
Stan	25	0	Relax, Tweek, we're just gonna have to go in there and explain what happened. There are more important things right now than free hats.	[]
Stan	20	0	Okay, uh, we wanna thank you all for coming. We're really happy to see such enthusiasm for our cause.	[]
Other	2	0	Yeah! Yeah!	[]
Stan	18	0	Uh, one thing before I continue. Unfortunately we don't have enough of the... free hats for everyone.	[]
Other	3	0	Eh- Excuse me?	[]
Cartman	14	0	Yes, we apologize, but our friend Tweek here didn't make enough of them.	[]
Other	9	0	Oh! Jesus! Don't tell them it was me!	[]
Other	6	0	We don't care about that.	[]
Other	3	0	You don't?	[]
Stan	11	0	You mean, you just came because you believe in our cause?	[]
Other	3	0	Yeah. Free Hat.	[]
Other	1	0	What?	[]
Other	16	0	Hat McCollough. He was sent to prison in '82, and we believe he should be released!	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Other	14	0	Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!	[]
Stan	21	0	Aaaah, , okay apparently there's been a bit of a misunderstanding. This is a rally to save films from their directors?	[]
Other	3	0	To do what?	[]
Kyle	20	0	We believe that films are pieces of art that must be preserved from the perverse hands of their agent filmmakers..	[]
Other	13	0	Oh. Sorry. Um, come on, everyone, guess we're in the wrong place.	[]
Other	6	0	Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!	[]
Stan	45	0	Waitwaitwaitwait!  Don't you see what's happening out there? The films you all grew up with, that touched YOUR lives and are part of YOUR soul are now being updated and changed. Join us and we CAN be a group that makes a difference!	[]
Other	8	0	Can't we also work towards freeing Hat?	[]
Stan	10	0	Uh, sure, and we'll also try to free Hat.	[]
Other	4	0	Oh yeeaahhh!! Raaaaah!! Woohoo!!	[]
Other	6	0	Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!	[]
Stan	4	0	...212, 213, 214 members!	[]
Other	12	0	You guys! You guys! Oh God! Um, I've got terrible news!	[]
Kyle	1	0	What?	[]
Other	13	0	Ted Koppel wants us to appear on Nightline to talk about our cause.	[]
Stan	4	0	Really? That's great.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Yah.	[]
Other	11	0	No it isn't, man! Thahat's waaay too much pressure!	[]
Stan	18	0	If we go on Nightline, the whole country can hear about what's happening to our classic films.	[]
Cartman	9	0	But just remember that I do all the talking.	[]
Kyle	2	0	You?? Why?	[]
Cartman	11	0	Because I'm the official spokesman. I got dibs on it.	[]
Stan	7	0	When did we do dibs for it?	[]
Cartman	6	0	Just now -  1 2 3 dibs!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Me.	[]
Other	2	0	Ga-ahah!	[]
Kyle	15	0	Alright, fine!  You're the spokesman, Cartman! But you'd better not screw it up!	[]
Cartman	5	0	What could possibly go wrong?	[]
Other	69	0	A new movement is sweeping the country, led by four determined boys from South Park, Colorado. The organization was created to protect Hollywood's classic films from the hands of their directors. And also to free Hat McCollough. So boys, I ask you the question that's on everyone's minds, why does your organization want to free Hat McCollough, the convicted, confessed serial murderer of twenty-three babies?	[]
Cartman	12	0	...I believe that can best be answered by our official spokesman, Tweek.	[]
Other	1	0	Gaaarh!	[]
Other	14	0	Well, Hat McCollough admitted he killed those toddlers? Why do you want him free?	[]
Other	5	0	Oh, Jesus, man! ...N'ahah!	[]
Other	14	0	Just answer me this, Tweek: What do you see as positive about toddler murder?	[]
Other	6	0	Ahah. U-uh. It's easy?	[]
Other	30	0	Yes... It is easy.  Alright, then on to your other cause, saving films from their directors. What got you boys interested in this, especially given your pro-toddler-murder status?	[]
Kyle	21	0	We believe that films have to be taken away from people like Steven Spielberg and George Lucas because they're insane.	[]
Other	18	0	Well I'm glad you said that, boys, because joining us now are Steven Spielberg and George Lucas.	[]
Other	3	0	Oh Christ! Wwwaaaaaaah!	[]
Other	2	0	Hello, Ted.	[]
Other	3	0	Oh hi, Ted.	[]
Other	20	0	Gentlemen, these toddler-murder fans think you're insane and shouldn't be allowed to alter your films. Your response?	[]
Other	16	0	Well, first of all, both George and I are very firmly against the murdering of toddlers.	[]
Other	3	0	You're here.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Dude, that's Steven Spielberg and George Lucas.	[]
Other	12	0	Get me out of here! Please, somebody get me out of heeerre!	[]
Other	32	0	And as for altering our films, all we're doing is trying to reach a... new audience with our movies. As the makers of dreams, we like to speak ...for the children.	[]
Kyle	9	0	Ah, I thought we were speaking for the children.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Yeah, we're children.	[]
Stan	20	0	Uh-look, if the Beatles went back and updated their White Album every few years, what would we have now?	[]
Cartman	9	0	Yeah, these guys are only motivated by money, Ted.	[]
Other	2	0	How so?	[]
Cartman	10	3	Think about it. Spielberg? Jew. Lucas? Jew. Kyle? Jew. Coincidence?	['jew', 'jew', 'jew']
Other	5	1	I'm not a Jew!	['jew']
Other	27	0	You little brat-! Ah, I mean, you darling children don't know what you're talking about. Changing E.T. was the best thing I ewver did.	[]
Kyle	19	0	Dude, don't you see that it's not? It'd be like, changing Raiders of the Lost Ark!	[]
Other	7	0	Wait a minute. What'd you say?	[]
Other	4	0	Eh, that's brilliant!	[]
Other	15	0	Yes. Change Raiders of the Lost Ark! Why didn't we think of it before?!	[]
Kyle	2	0	No. NOO!!	[]
Stan	47	0	Members, this is our darkest hour. We've just learned that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg now intend to update and change Raiders of the Lost Ark.  There's only one way we can stop this important and historical piece of art from being harmed. Mr. Secretary?	[]
Cartman	32	0	Thank you.  Our intelligence tells us that the original negative to Raiders of the Lost Ark is currently somewhere in George Lucas's house. We need to find and usurp that negative.	[]
Other	15	0	And if we get a hold ot the negative they can't change the movie?	[]
Stan	4	0	That is our understanding.	[]
Other	19	0	Sounds like a good idea to me. I don't want them to change Raiders of the Lost Ark.	[]
Other	1	0	YEAH!	[]
Other	14	0	Yeah! We should go get that negative as soon as we get Hat free!	[]
Other	7	0	YEAH!  Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!	[]
Kyle	7	0	Nonono! We need to do this first.	[]
Other	6	0	But we have to free Hat.	[]
Stan	11	0	It's just that, you know, he killed twenty-three babies.	[]
Other	8	0	Well yeah, but it was in self-defense!	[]
Other	1	0	YEAH!	[]
Cartman	8	0	He... killed... twenty-three babies in self-defense?	[]
Other	26	0	Hat was attacked maliciously and unprovoked by a gang of babies in West Town Park. When that many babies get together they can be like piranha.	[]
Other	16	0	Three eyewitnesses testified that if Hat hadn't killed those babies, they'd have killed him!	[]
Other	7	0	YEAH!  Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!	[]
Stan	16	0	Alright alright. But right now we've gotta focus on getting those original prints of Raider	[]
Other	36	0	He's right. We'd better split up. Some of you go with the boys and get those film prints, the rest of us come with me to go talk to the governor about freeing Hat.	[]
Other	17	0	YEAH!  Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!	[]
Stan	12	0	Well, it looks like we're gonna have to do this ourselves.	[]
Other	16	0	No! Not this! I'm out! I can't deal with the stress you guys create!	[]
Kyle	19	0	We're just gonna fly to California and break into George Lucas's house. What's stressful about that?	[]
Other	1	0	Hwaaah!	[]
Cartman	31	0	Okay, Tweek, let me tell you something: You've been our new friend now for two weeks, okay? And I've gotta be honest with you, it isn't going well.	[]
Other	1	0	Haaah!	[]
Cartman	40	0	People aren't that into you, Tweek. They find you kind of annoying. Now, I say you've got one last shot here, and I don't want you to blow it, okay? Does that help take the stress off?	[]
Stan	2	0	Okay, go.	[]
Other	23	0	I'm breaking into George Lucas's house. I'm not breaking into George Lucas's house. I'm in a green field.	[]
Cartman	9	1	Stop, Tweek! This is not the time for faggocity!	['faggocity']
Kyle	6	0	This looks like the right room.	[]
Other	8	0	I'm in a field... surrounded by deer.	[]
Stan	2	0	Over here!	[]
Kyle	3	0	That's it!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Alriiight! Get it, Tweek!	[]
Other	2	0	Huh uh.	[]
Cartman	14	1	Get it, you piece of crap, before I grab your nutsack and twist it!	['crap']
Other	3	0	Guh huh huh!	[]
Other	4	0	What are you doing?!	[]
Other	4	0	Oh God! Oh Jesus!	[]
Other	11	0	You're the boys from that ...stupid club. Give me that!	[]
Other	1	0	Aaaaaah!	[]
Kyle	18	0	Do with us what you will, Mr. Lucas!  But please, don't change Raiders of the Lost Ark.	[]
Other	16	0	We're gonna make it better. The movie's gonna be changed, and that's that!	[]
Cartman	19	0	Alright, you asked for it. I'm afraid you leave us no choice. It's time for Plan B.	[]
Stan	2	0	Aw, really?	[]
Other	6	0	Oh God, no! Not Plan B!	[]
Cartman	25	0	You have a heart made of ice, Mr. Lucas, and so we're goin' tuh melt your icy heart... with a cool island song. Gentlemen?	[]
Other	1	0	...What??	[]
Cartman	16	0	Hit it, Tweek!  In the tropical isle with the coconut tree, there's a lots of-	[]
Stan	15	0	Waitwaitwaitwaitwait. I thought we were gonna cool his hot heart with a cool island song.	[]
Cartman	6	0	...No, he has an icy heart.	[]
Kyle	11	0	...But you can't melt ice with a cool song, 'tardheart.	[]
Stan	13	0	So we have to warm his icy heart with a hot island song	[]
Cartman	6	0	It's a cool island song.	[]
Kyle	16	0	Well then we're gonna end up freezing his hellish heart with a cool island song.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Oh, do we wanna do that?	[]
Other	4	0	ALRIGHT, that does it!	[]
Other	19	0	Yes, thank you, officer.  The police are on their way, boys.  Soon you'll be in jail getting RAMMED!	[]
Other	1	0	Aaaahh!	[]
Stan	20	0	Those rams can do to us what they will, Mr. Lucas, but we'll never stop trying to protect films.	[]
Kyle	27	0	It's not too late to do what's right. Give us the print. There's still some good in you, Mr. Lucas. We know there is.	[]
Other	7	0	It is... too late for me, boys.	[]
Kyle	18	0	You yourself led the campaign against the colorization of films. You understand why films shouldn't be changed.	[]
Other	23	0	M-that's different. These are my movies. I made them, and I have the right to do whatever I want with them	[]
Stan	38	0	You're wrong, Mr. Lucas. They're not your movies. They're ours. All of ours. We paid to go see them, and they're just as much a part of our lives as they are of yours.	[]
Kyle	10	0	When an artist creates, whatever they create belongs to society	[]
Other	15	0	Have I... become so old that I've forgetten what being an artist is about?	[]
Stan	21	0	Give the print to us so that we can protect it from Spielberg and anyone else who wants to alter it.	[]
Other	4	0	Perhaps... you are right.	[]
Other	6	0	STOP!  What are you doing, George?!	[]
Other	3	0	Steven, Uh, I-	[]
Other	11	0	Give me that print, George! We need to make the alterations!	[]
Other	17	0	Steven, these boys had a point. I don't remember what it was, but it was good.	[]
Other	21	0	You haven't let these doe-eyed children affect your judgment, have you, George?!  Don't forget: you belong to me.	[]
Kyle	14	0	Don't listen to him! You still have a chance to preserve your film!	[]
Other	7	0	I'm... ah I'm sorry, boys.	[]
Other	5	0	Now take the children prisoner!	[]
Kyle	1	0	What??	[]
Other	25	1	You troublemakers shall be my guests of honor at the premiere of the NEW Raiders of the Lost Ark! Your gay little club is over!	['gay']
Stan	8	1	Fuck you, Steven Spielberg! Come on, you guys!	['fuck']
Other	8	0	Oh my God they're gonna kill us.	[]
Other	16	0	Don't even think about it, kid! I'm not afraid to use this walkie-talkie!	[]
Other	9	0	The one with the cocaine-problem escaped, mein Direktor.	[]
Other	20	0	Leave him!! Let him run back to his mommy!  We must get the film ready for the premiere.  Lucas! Come!	[]
Other	68	0	Coming, this summer!  It's the digitally-enhanced re-release of the very first pilot episode of South Park!  Yes, the classic, rough, hand-made first episode is getting a make-over for 2002!  The simple, funny aliens are now super-badass and kewl!  Flying saucer? No longer cheap construction paper, but a 4.0 megapixel constructed through a masterpiece of technology! Everything's new! New is better!	[]
Other	21	0	When we first made South Park, we didn't wanna use construction paper. We just had to because it was cheap.	[]
Other	18	0	And now with new technology we can finally remaster South Park, make it look sharp, clean and focused.	[]
Other	1	0	Expensive.	[]
Other	24	0	Yes, all the charm of a simple little cartoon  will melt before your eyes as it is replaced by newer and more standardized animation!	[]
Other	29	0	For instance, in the scene at the bus stop, we always meant to have Imperial walkers and giant dewback lizards in the background, but simply couldn't afford it.	[]
Other	17	0	Get this special enhanced version quick, because another enhanced version will likely be coming out for 2003!	[]
Other	25	0	Members, uuhh, oh Jesus, uh, we have to do something! Our club president , treasurer , and secretary  have all been taken hostage be Steven Spielberg! Haaa!	[]
Other	5	0	Prisoner? You mean, like Hat?	[]
Other	4	0	Yes, just like hat!!	[]
Other	16	0	But the governor won't pardon Hat. So how can we get him out of prison?	[]
Other	68	0	No! Listen to me! We're not talking about Hat right now, okay?! Gad!! Look, we went to George Lucas's house a-and tried to melt his icy heart with a warm island song, but then Spielberg showed up and took three of our members prisoner! They're goin' to premiere their new Raiders of the Lost Ark, and we have to rescue them! Do you understand?!	[]
Other	7	0	Hey, he's got a point there.	[]
Other	15	0	Yeah... Maybe we could melt the governor's icy heart with a cool island song!	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Other	1	0	No!	[]
Other	1	0	No?	[]
Other	16	0	No! He's right. We have to freeze his hot heart with a cool island song.	[]
Other	12	0	Or is ti freshen his hot temper with a cool island song?	[]
Other	11	0	Let's cool his hot temper with a fresh island song.	[]
Other	3	0	That's it!	[]
Other	5	0	Let's go! Come on!	[]
Other	12	0	Oh God. I'm gonna have to do this myself. Oh God!	[]
Other	53	0	Well, the print is finished and the day has come. Tonight, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas  will be at the premiere of the new special edition of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Lots of celebrity guests and other rich people will be on hand to witness all the updated effects and modernized technology.	[]
Other	1	0	Hello!	[]
Other	6	0	The kid? The tweaked out kid?!	[]
Other	8	0	I'm gonna blow up the print, Spielberg!	[]
Other	5	0	Your pesistence surprises even me.	[]
Other	11	0	Surely you don't think you can escape from this premiere.	[]
Other	17	0	That depends on how reasonable we're all willing to be. All I want are my friends.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Wow.	[]
Other	7	0	Except for Cartman - you can keep him.	[]
Cartman	1	0	AY!	[]
Other	4	0	And if we refuse?	[]
Other	6	0	Then your premiere has no movie!	[]
Stan	5	0	He's definitely lost it	[]
Kyle	1	0	Yup.	[]
Other	59	0	Okay, okay. Stan- stand back, stand ba- stand back! Back!  Okay kid, you win.  Blow it up.  Zuroch!  Zuroch!  Blow it back to God.  All your life has been the pursuit of seeing a great film! This new version of Raiders has digital effects beyond your wildest dreams! You want to see it screened just as much as I.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Come on, Tweek! Blow it up!	[]
Other	15	0	Son, we are simply passing through history. This... is imPROVED history.  Do as you will.	[]
Other	17	0	In the tropical isle with the coconut tree, the air is fresh and the people are free.	[]
Other	11	0	But here in the mountain there's no freedom like that.	[]
Other	11	0	There's a man in prison and his name is Hat.	[]
Other	34	0	Hafaa malifi! Thanks for coming, everyone.  This is the birth of the NEW version of Raiders of the Lost Ark! We shall screen it here, and then destroy all the old prints in celebration!	[]
Other	3	0	Hooray! All right!	[]
Other	3	0	Begin the film!	[]
Other	1	0	Whoa.	[]
Stan	10	0	You guys, close your eyes. Don't look at it.	[]
Other	2	0	Ah, what?!	[]
Stan	14	0	Don't watch the movie, you guys. It'll be terrible. Close your eyes!	[]
Other	2	0	Whoa. Ahhh.	[]
Other	3	0	It's beyooootiful.	[]
Other	7	0	Wait a minute. This version is awful!	[]
Other	4	0	Yeah! They ruined it!	[]
Other	6	0	Oh my God, it's terrible!	[]
Other	1	0	AaaaAAAAA!!	[]
Stan	4	0	Yuh, you guys okay.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Yeah. I I think so.	[]
Cartman	8	1	Man, that new version must have sucked balls.	['balls']
Other	17	0	Today is a day of celebration, and we owe it all to these four brave young boys.	[]
Other	2	0	Yeah! Alright!	[]
Other	18	0	And thanks to the bravery of this young man in particular,  ...Hat McCollough is finally free from prison!	[]

Other	2	0	Yeah! Woohoohoo!	[]
Stan	10	0	Come on, you guys. Let's get out of here.	[]
Other	3	0	Oh my God!	[]
Kyle	17	0	Do you think we did a good thing, Stan?  I mean, no one even seemed to notice.	[]
Stan	43	0	Yeah well, sometimes the things we do don't matter right now. Sometimes they matter... later. We have to care more about later sometimes, you know? I think that's what separates us from the Steven Spielbergs and George Lucases of the world.	[]
Cartman	7	0	That and youth. Those guys are old.	[]
Other	23	0	But what about the original prints of Raiders of the Lost Ark? What if somebody else takes them and tries to change them?	[]
Stan	15	0	Don't worry, Tweek. It's somewhere safe. Somewhere where... nobody will ever find it.	[]
