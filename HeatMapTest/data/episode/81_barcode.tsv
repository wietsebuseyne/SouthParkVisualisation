Other	11	0	Thanks for having us all over for dinner, Chris and Linda.	[]
Other	4	0	Yes, it was fabulous!	[]
Other	18	0	Oh, we're just really happy that your boys have become such good friends with our little Butters!	[]
Other	20	0	Yeah. We figure that if our boys are goona be great friends, we should all get to be friends, too.	[]
Other	3	0	Friends, by default.	[]
Randy	32	0	Well, our boys do seem to be spending a lot of time together lately. I think ever since their friend Kenny died they've been looking for someone to fill the void.	[]
Other	22	0	Well, our son is a perfect void-filler. It's nice that he finally has your sons to be his best buddies!	[]
Cartman	6	0	Look you guys, Butters is asleep.	[]
Stan	5	1	He's such a douchebag	['douchebag']
Cartman	27	0	Hey! Have you guys ever seen this trick?  When someone's sleeping, you can take a glass of warm water,  and you put their hand in it...	[]
Stan	4	0	Yeah, and then what?	[]
Cartman	8	0	And then, you pee on it!  heheh-heheheheheheheh.	[]
Kyle	17	0	No, dude, you're supposed to put their hand in warm water and it makes them pee.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Oh, really? ...Oh well, heh, heheheheh, heh	[]
Other	29	0	And we were thinking, since they've all become such close friends, how great it would be for us to all go together to Aspen for a ski weekend.	[]
Other	10	0	A-Aspen? Uuuh, we, we can't really afford that.	[]
Other	28	0	No, you see, Linda and I found this ad where you can get two night free at a condo in Aspen if you attend a time-share presentation..	[]
Randy	6	0	They let you stay for free?	[]
Other	13	0	Yes! And all we have to do is attend a thirty-minute meeting!	[]
Other	7	0	Well that sounds like a good deal.	[]
Randy	9	0	Sounds good to me; let's go this weekend!	[]
Other	9	0	Oh, boy! Skiing in Aspen! I can't wait!	[]
Other	11	0	Hey boys! We're all going to Aspen for the weekend!	[]
Other	2	0	All right!	[]

Other	14	0	Oh, this is gonna be so much fun; I haven't skied in years!	[]
Other	5	0	Where are Butters and Eric?	[]

Other	10	0	Butters? Eric? Come on! We gotta get to the powder!	[]
Other	17	0	Hello, folks, I'm Phil and this is Josh . We're with the Aspen Time-Share Company.	[]
Other	1	0	Hello.	[]
Other	5	0	You folks enjoying the condo?	[]
Other	5	0	It's lovely. Thank you.	[]
Cartman	14	0	You guys, you guys! You're not gonna believe this, this is so funny!	[]
Kyle	1	0	What	[]
Cartman	12	0	So last night, while Butters was asleep, I gave him a Hitler.	[]
Stan	4	0	What's a Hitler?	[]
Cartman	34	1	You know, when somebody is sleeping and you put your finger up your butt and then, wipe it on their upper lip to give them a little Hitler mustache? You've never Hitlered anyone?	['butt']
Stan	4	0	No, I never have.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Shh-shh, here he comes.	[]
Butters	17	0	Goooood mornin', fellas! All set to go skiin'?!  A-huh, u-uh, uh what's so funny?	[]
Cartman	4	0	Nothing, Butters. Right, guys?!	[]
Other	22	0	Well, we can't wait to show you what Aspen Time-Share is offering investors. Shall we do our thirty-minute meeting?	[]
Randy	9	0	Oh, do we have to do it right now?	[]
Other	12	0	Well, best to do it and get it out of the way.	[]
Other	1	0	Okay.	[]
Other	23	0	Boys, we have to go to this time-share presentation real quick, but you go meet your ski instructor on the bunny hill.	[]
Other	1	0	Okay.	[]
Other	8	0	We'll meet you boys on the slopes.	[]
Butters	6	0	Hey, do you guys smell that?	[]
Stan	2	0	Smell what?	[]
Butters	9	0	Ehh, it kind of smells stinky in this condo.	[]
Cartman	8	0	I don't smell anything. Do you guys?	[]
Butters	22	0	Do you guys smell that? It smells bad out here, too. I'm starting to think this whole town smells like doodoo.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Yeah, well, that why they call is Asspen.	[]
Other	23	0	All right, little dudes,  great to see you out here. My name is Thumper, and I'm gonna be your cool ski instructor.	[]
Cartman	4	0	His name is Thumper?	[]
Other	83	0	We're gonna take it slow, take it easy, make sure everybody has a goood time. 'Cause what is skiing about? Having a good...?  Time, that's right. Now, just a few safety things to keep in mind: First of all, look straight ahead when you ski. You look down, you're gonna fall, you're gonna have a bad time. Also, be aware of skiers around you. You run into another skier, your skis are gonna cross, gonna have a bad time.	[]
Butters	11	0	So where's the part where we have a good time?	[]
Other	9	1	Hey, little dude, you got some crap right here.	['crap']
Butters	6	0	Wuh, that's my face, sir.	[]
Other	53	0	Alright, we're gonna do this without any poles until we know our two primary feet positions. To go slow, we wedge our skis together , in the shape of a slice of pizza. Then to go faster, we put 'em parallel, like... French fries.  You see that?  Pizza,  French fries,  Pizza,  French fries.	[]
Butters	14	0	Ah-hey, this is gonna be just like eatin' at Shakey's, huh fellas?	[]
Other	16	0	Okay, let's have the little dude at the end try first! What's your name?	[]
Ike	1	0	Iiiiike!	[]
Other	6	0	Okay, Mike, ski down to me!	[]
Kyle	3	0	Go on, Ike.	[]
Ike	12	0	Pee-za, Fron fries. Pee-za, Fron fries. Fron friiiies.  Peeee-zaaa	[]
Other	28	0	Okay, you see what he did?! He French-fried when he should've pizza'd. You French-fry when you pizza, you're gonna have a bad time!	[]
Other	22	0	And so, we think we can convince you to buy one of our combos that's opening right here in Phase 4.	[]
Other	7	0	That sounds like a GREAT investment opportunity!	[]
Other	17	0	I-I'm sorry, but none of us can really afford to own our own vacation condo.	[]
Randy	18	0	Yeah, and to be honest, we're just doing this meeting because of the two nights free deal.	[]
Other	33	0	Oh, I know, that's what everybody says - Not me, I can't afford it. But what if I told you you could own one of our properties for only eight thousand dollars!	[]
Other	1	0	Wow!	[]
Other	11	0	For only eight thousand dollars we can buy a condo here?	[]
Other	32	0	Well you see, time-share means you buy the condo with about twenty other people like yourselves  You  share the condo with other investors and pick the  time you want to stay.	[]
Other	4	0	Share,  time.  Time share.	[]
Randy	7	0	So then it's not really ours.	[]
Other	35	0	Sure it is, one twenty-fourth and a half yours! You see, time-share has made it possible for even working-class people like you to say, I've got a little place in Aspen.	[]
Other	13	0	Try it. Try saying it. I've got a little place in Aspen.	[]
Other	8	0	I've got a little place in Aspen.	[]
Other	31	0	Rolls off the tongue, doesn't it? Say guys, how'd you like to tell that hot secretary I've got a nice little place in Aspen? Hahaha! Just kidding, wives.	[]
Randy	16	0	Listen uh, it's been thirty minutes. We'd like to go hit the slopes now?	[]
Other	21	0	Woll uh, you still gotta come to the time-share luncheon. We did give you a free condo for the weekend.	[]
Other	13	0	Well your ad said we only had to attend a thirty-minute meeting.	[]
Other	26	0	Right, but this isn't that meeting. The luncheon is that meeting.  Don't worry, you're gonna have a great free meal at  the luncheon.	[]
Kyle	8	0	...French fries... pizza... french fries...  come on, Cartman.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Ugh, no more.,	[]
Other	12	0	Looks like you think you're a pretty good skier, huh, kid?	[]
Stan	9	0	Well I'm... catchin' on pretty fast, I guess.	[]
Other	13	0	I've been skiing for twenty-two years. Think you could beat me?	[]
Stan	2	0	Uhh... no.	[]
Other	6	0	What's your name, hot shot?	[]
Stan	2	0	Stan. Marsh.	[]
Other	8	0	Stan Marsh  Stan DARSH is more like it.	[]
Other	2	0	Haaaa, Darsh!	[]
Other	9	0	Alright, how about a race, then? You and me.	[]
Stan	5	0	Dude, I'm just learning.	[]
Other	13	0	OooooOOOOooo!  Looks to me like you're not a hot shot after all.	[]
Stan	5	0	I never said I was.	[]
Other	1	0	Oooooooo!	[]
Other	1	0	Oooooooo!	[]
Other	26	0	You may think you've got what it takes, but as long as I'm around, you'll always be number two!  See ya later, Darsh!	[]
Other	15	0	And THAT is why owning a piece of an Aspen condo is not only possible,...	[]
Other	4	0	It's downright smart!	[]
Other	1	0	Aha.	[]
Other	10	0	Op, here it is! As promised, a fabulous free lunch!	[]
Other	5	0	Wow, filet mignon' and lobster!	[]
Other	2	0	Not bad.	[]
Other	9	0	It's nice to feel rich, isn't it.	[]
Other	7	0	Oh, you know, this is really great.	[]
Other	3	0	It sure it.	[]
Other	1	0	What?	[]
Randy	1	0	Wait...	[]
Other	21	0	You see? That's the great thing about time-share. You get a little taste of luxuries you can't afford.	[]
Other	10	0	And then share it with the people who come tomorrow.	[]
Randy	11	0	All right, look, we've been here for over three hours	[]
Other	6	0	Yeah. Can we go now, please?	[]
Other	32	0	Of course you can. Go hit those slopes!  If you could just please show me the backs of your table place cards real quick?  Oh my God! You got the red sticker!	[]
Other	5	0	They got the red sticker?!	[]
Other	5	0	They got the red sticker!	[]
Other	5	0	What's the red sticker?	[]
Other	22	0	Uh, well, well, that means if you come up to the condo sales office you'll receive one of three great prizes.	[]
Randy	19	0	No, no-no-no-no. We, we did your meeting and we did your lunch, we're finished, okay.	[]
Other	47	0	Okay, okay, fine, I mean...  It would only take a second, but, I mean, you know, what did we do for you except, give you a free condo for the weekend. Huh. Seems like you could just... could just come up... and see what prize you had...	[]
Other	3	0	O-all right!	[]
Stan	6	0	...pizza... french fries... french fries... pizza...	[]
Kyle	13	0	...french fries...pizza...pizza...pizza-french fries... I wonder where our parents are.	[]
Stan	10	0	Who cares? I'm having more fun on my own.	[]
Other	9	0	well well well, if it isn't Stan Darsh!	[]
Stan	2	0	Oh no.	[]
Other	17	0	Say Darsh, you don't mind if I take Heather out for some fondue tonight, do ya?	[]
Stan	1	0	Heather?	[]
Other	17	0	Sorry, Stan, it's just that when it comes to skiing, Tad has all the right moves.	[]
Other	14	0	I just might show her my moves tonight, if you know what I mean.	[]
Other	19	0	You aren't mad, are you, Stan? I mean, a girl's gotta look out for her best interests.	[]
Stan	4	0	...who are you people?!	[]
Other	17	0	Still don't wanna race me? I told you he was chicken, Heather. Stan Marsh the Darsh!	[]
Stan	12	0	All right dude, if I race you will you leave me alone?	[]

Other	6	0	Finally, we get to go skiing!	[]
Randy	10	0	Oh my God, look how long the lift lines are.	[]
Other	15	0	Yeah, I guess these passes the time-share salesman gave us will come in handy.	[]
Other	4	0	Can I help you?	[]
Other	16	0	Yes, we have the special passes to use the exclusive lift from the time-share company?	[]
Other	6	0	Ooooh, go right on ahead, folks.	[]
Other	2	0	Thank you.	[]
Randy	5	0	Well, this certainly is nice.	[]

Randy	3	1	Oh, God-damnit!	['damnit']
Kyle	12	1	Dude, it's been twelve hours. Where the hell are our parents?!	['hell']
Other	12	0	I'm glad you guys came. Do you like our youth center?	[]
Stan	3	0	I' seems fine.	[]
Other	20	0	Yeah, too bad we're getting shut down. That hot-shot skier Tad's father is gonna bulldoze the building	[]
Other	8	0	Where are all us kids supposed to go?	[]
Stan	3	0	Don't care.	[]
Kyle	6	0	What do you wanna do now?	[]
Stan	2	0	I dunno.	[]
Butters	3	0	Let's dance.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Butters, I hate you with every inch of my body.	[]
Other	21	0	Alright, Aspen-heh. As a special treat tonight we're proud to have the winner of today's race, Tad Mikowski.	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Stan	2	0	Oh,. God.	[]
Other	13	0	Hey everyone.  I'd like to sing a little song, if I may.	[]
Other	1	0	Ooooooooo.	[]

Other	11	0	A rematch? Oh, Darsh. You're even dumber than I thought.	[]
Other	6	0	He'll ski you anytime, anywhere	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Other	16	0	But this time, if he wins, you get your dad to not close our youth center	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Other	13	0	Alright then, let's make it interesting. Tomorrow afternoon. On the K-13.	[]
Other	14	0	The K-13? But that's the most dangerous run in all of America.	[]
Other	8	1	Hell, I'm not chicken! Are you, Darsh?!	['hell']
Stan	6	0	I'll be there, you queen!	[]
Other	2	0	Oh, yeah?!	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Other	13	0	Oh, Darsh, you're even dumber than I thought... Again! See ya tomorrow.	[]
Butters	15	0	Uh you're not really gonna go down that K-13 run, are ya, Stan?	[]
Stan	4	0	Dude, I have to!	[]
Kyle	14	0	Stan, you can't let that Tad guy get to you. Screw him, dude.	[]
Stan	5	0	Dude, he's got Heather!	[]
Kyle	6	0	You don't even know Heather!	[]
Stan	32	0	I know I know I-, ugh. Look I can't explain it but I have to do this. I'm not gonna die. I mean, how bad can the K-13 be?	[]
Other	94	0	The K-13? You don't wanna go down that run. That run has got a history. Thirty-five people have died goin' down it, and some say you can still see their ghosts up there. It was on that very ski run that a group of students were killed by a wolf-boy who escaped from a mental institution. You see, that ski run was once a burial ground to a tribe of vampire Wichicaw who ate the flesh of children with no eyes. Yah-, a lot of history on that ski run.	[]
Stan	2	0	...Thank you.	[]
Other	1	0	Yah.	[]
Kyle	18	0	Look, Stan. When Kenny died I learned how important friends are. I'm not gonna lose another friend.	[]
Stan	15	0	This isn't about you, Kyle, I have to do this, okay? I have to!	[]
Other	13	0	...And so you see it's the investment opportunity that keeps on giving.	[]
Other	20	0	How many times do we have to tell you this? We don't want to buy shares in a condo!	[]
Other	9	0	And we certainly don't want to pressure you.	[]
Other	17	0	Pressure us?! You kept us all day yesterday and then had a chair lift bring us back!	[]
Other	27	0	Heh-ey, you can leave anytime you want. Of course, that is, if you don't want the super-secret fun prize for attending the slide show.	[]
Randy	18	0	No, we don't want the super-secret fun prize alright?! We just wanna ski! Come on, everybody!	[]
Other	12	0	I know! Have you ever considered going in on a time share?	[]
Other	8	0	That's only a couple thousand each, Josh!	[]
Randy	9	0	Don't listen to 'em, let's just go!	[]
Other	7	0	My God, can you believe those people?!	[]
Other	21	0	I hope you don't blame me for all that. I mean, the ad ...did... just say a thirty-minute presentation.	[]
Randy	7	0	Let's just get out of here.	[]
Other	19	0	Folks, I'm glad you're back, because we forgot to mention, time-share condos are still deeded properties!	[]
Other	1	0	Aaagh!!	[]
Other	14	0	Oooo, you folks really lucked out this time. You're visitor number one thousand!	[]
Other	13	0	That means you can listen to our special offer for privileged members only!	[]
Stan	8	0	That does it! I'm calling the police!	[]
Stan	18	0	Mr. Ski Instructor, I need a lot of training, fast. I'm gonna race down the K-13.	[]
Other	20	0	K-13?! But you're just a beginner! You ski outta your league, you're gonna have a bad time.	[]
Stan	9	0	I have to do this, okay? I have to!	[]
Other	21	0	Alright, well, if you gotta get good at somethin' really fast, there's only one way to do it. Come on!	[]
Other	148	0	The day is approaching to give it your best You've got to reach your prime! That's when you need to put yourself to the test And show us the passage of time We're gonna need a montage (Montage) A sports-training montage (Montage) And just show a lot of things happenin' at once. Remind everyone of what's goin' on. (What's goin' on?) And with every shot, show a little improvement To show it won't take too long That's called a montage (Montage) Even Rocky had a montage (Montage) In any sport, if you want to go From just a beginner to a pro You'll need a montage (Montage) a simple little montage (Montage) Always fade out (Montage) into a montage (Montage) If you fade out it seems like a long time (Montage) has passed in a montage (Montage) Montage (Montage)	[]
Randy	32	0	All the ad said was that we had to attend a thirty-minute meeting, right, and- and it's been a day and a half! These guys won't let us leave!	[]
Other	13	0	That's not true, officers, we said they could leave at any time.	[]
Other	35	0	All right, let me see if I got this straight. You two gentlemen are offering part-time limited liability  ownership in one of your fabulous condos for the one-time price of eight thousand dollars?!	[]
Other	3	0	That's right!	[]
Other	21	0	Sounds to me like if anybody should be arrested it should be you people for passin' up such a great deal!	[]
Other	14	0	That's right, you're practically stealing condos at that price. Book 'em, Danno!	[]
Randy	2	0	Oh, Jesus.	[]
Other	2	0	No! No!	[]
Other	7	0	The police work for time-share, too?	[]
Other	31	0	The police, the mayor, the president of the United States. Perhaps now you see the severity of your situation. I think we shall all sit down...  and listen to the presentation.	[]
Other	1	0	Sit!	[]
Other	15	0	Now, you're probably asking yourselves... Can my time-share condo turn into a profit?	[]
Other	11	0	What kind of cash flow can I realize from my investment?	[]
Other	13	0	The answer might astonish you. For over ten years investors have seen their-	[]
Other	17	0	The powder is fresh and the stage is set for Tad versus Stan on the K-13!	[]
Other	12	0	This time you're not just gonna lose, you're gonna die!	[]
Kyle	21	1	I can't lose another friend. First Kenny and now Stan? All I'm gonna have left are you two douches.	['douches']
Other	3	0	Ready. Set. Go!	[]
Stan	3	0	Pizza... pizza... pizza...	[]
Other	5	0	Tad's got the lead.	[]
Butters	3	0	Come on, Stan!	[]
Other	8	0	Haha.  This should slow down Darsh a bit!	[]
Other	10	0	And it looks like Tad is way out in front.	[]
Other	6	0	Now, I'll win for sure!	[]
Kyle	6	0	Awgh, dude, I can't look.	[]
Other	23	0	Let's see what some sand does to your speed, Darsh! He doesn't stand a chance, now! I'm gonna beat 'em!	[]
Other	13	0	The race is half over and Tad is still out in the lead!	[]
Other	26	0	Heh, when Darsh skis by here, I'll let all these hamsters go. That should distract him just long enough for me to win the race!	[]
Other	2	0	Oh, Tad.	[]
Other	6	0	...What are you doing up here?	[]
Other	11	0	Oh nothing. I just thought I could distract you. With these.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Good job, dude!	[]
Stan	1	0	Thanks.	[]
Other	4	0	You did it, Stan!	[]
Other	15	0	Thanks a lot, Stan. Now we're gonna be able to keep the youth center.	[]
Other	17	0	Well, that does it. Looks like the spirits of the Wakichaw Indians can finally rest in peace.	[]
Other	13	0	Stan, I was wrong about you. Would you like to go out again?	[]
Other	9	0	Go ahead, Stan. She's everything you ever wanted.	[]
Other	4	0	There you are, boys!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Mom, Dad!	[]
Stan	7	1	Where the hell have you guys been?!	['hell']
Other	13	0	Uh, we got a little held up at the time-share sales office.	[]
Randy	32	0	Yeah, but the good news is we finally came to our senses and bought some shares in a condo. So we all get to come to Aspen for two weeks every year!	[]
Other	1	0	Awwwwww!	[]
Other	10	0	What's the matter? Didn't you boys like skiing?	[]
Stan	61	1	No! We can't keep track of when you pizza and when you French-fries and when the hot-shot asshole skier takes your girl or if you're supposed to race him the first time or train first to beat him on the really difficult mountain so you can save the dorky but hot girl's youth center. Skiing sucks!	['asshole']
Kyle	5	0	Yeah, what a stupid sport!	[]
Other	15	0	I heard that you were the one responsible for making Tad lose the race. Thanks.	[]
Other	9	0	Yeah. Well he really flipped when he saw these.	[]
Other	1	0	Quaid...	[]
Other	3	0	Start the reactor...	[]
