Right now, I would like all students of Canadian descent in this school to stand up.  Just look at all these fine Canadians in your school. See how diverse they are. When you think of Canada, what's the one thing that comes to mind?	[]

Other	12	0	It's like the world doesn't respect Canada at all, eh?	[]
Other	36	0	That's right! And I think it's time for Canada to show the world just how bad things would be without it! Together we can send a message! It's time for Canada ...to strike!	[]
Other	4	0	Did you say strike?	[]
Other	7	0	Yes! Every Canadian join me! Join together!	[]

Other	5	0	No, it uses natural gas.	[]
Other	6	1	Not as fat as your face!	['fat']
Butters	9	0	Huh, it somehow loses its punch after multiple viewings.	[]
Cartman	14	1	God damn it, when are they going to air new Terrance and Phillip shows?!	['damn']
Kyle	26	0	There aren't gonna be new shows! Don't you get it?! Terrance and Phillip are Canadian! We have to get Canada to end this strike!	[]
Stan	12	0	It's not a big deal. We can just watch American comedy.	[]
Other	15	0	You think that's bad? Remember the time I sang La Cucaracha for Paul McCartney?	[]
Cartman	2	0	No! NOOO!	[]
Other	8	0	La Cucaracha-  We are NOT... resorting to that!	[]
Other	6	0	We want more! We want more!	[]

Kyle	10	0	Huh? Well we don't really have that much money.	[]
Other	11	0	Oh, negotiating hardball, are we?! What about all that Internet money?!	[]
Kyle	2	0	The Internet?	[]
Other	61	2	You listen to me, friend!  You'd better figure out a way to get us our fair amount of money, and until you come back with a solid fair number, I'm finished talking to you, you slimy corporate dickhead!  Don't worry, don't worry. This is how negotiating works. This is good. We've got 'em by the balls.	['dickhead', 'balls']
Stan	4	0	What'd they say?	[]
Kyle	14	0	They said we have to give them money that we make on the Internet.	[]
Cartman	10	0	How are we supposed to make money on the Internet?	[]
Butters	10	0	Well, how do other people make money on the Internet?	[]
Kyle	15	0	We'd have to put something up on the Internet that everyone would find fascinating.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Wait. I've got it.	[]
Butters	120	11	I said what what? In the butt I said what what? In the butt I said what what? In the butt  I said what what? In the butt You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?

Kyle	10	0	Don't worry, Ike! The strike will be over soon!	[]
Other	18	0	And in other world news, the leader of Japan today is calling for an increase in military spending.	[]
Other	16	0	How come they never mention anything about us?! When are they gonna get to the strike?!	[]
Other	19	0	Don't worry, the strike is big news. I'm sure it will be one of the top stories.	[]

Other	28	0	Look, ah, Stephen, Terrance and I were talking andeh, well it's, it's starting to look like maybe we're not gonna win this thing, you know?	[]
Other	10	0	We'll win! We'll just have to stay resilient!	[]
Other	8	0	Wull, yeah, but everyone is dying of starvation.	[]
Other	7	0	Yeah, let's give it up, guy.	[]
Other	12	0	Don't call me your guy! I'm not your guy, friend!	[]

Other	1	0	What?	[]
Other	10	0	Do you really think you Danish can replace the Canadians?	[]
Other	22	0	Well, where we come from it's pretty cold too, ja. We like hockey and nobody really pays any attention to us.	[]
Other	5	0	Nobody knows where Denmark is.	[]
Other	13	0	Right. So when you think about it, we're the Canadians of Europe.	[]
Other	4	0	SCABS! How could you?!	[]
Stan	19	0	Ah, hi. We made a really successful thing on the Internet, and we'd like to collect our money.	[]
Other	8	0	Take a number and wait with everyone else.	[]
Cartman	15	1	Ma'am, perhaps you don't recognize the Internet sensation Little Gay Kid from YouToob.	['gay']
Other	8	0	Take a number and wait with everyone else!	[]
Other	2	0	Chocolate Raaain.	[]
Butters	1	0	Aaah.	[]
Other	13	1	Hey, I know you. You're the What What (In My Asshole) kid.	['asshole']
Butters	6	1	What What (In The Butt), sir.	['butt']

Even if it means we all. Die.	['ass']
Kyle	7	0	We don't want you to die.	[]
Other	18	0	Then you'd better hurry. We don't have much longer. The blood will be on your hands.	[]
Kyle	18	0	We have to speed this up!  Uh, can we collect our Internet money in front of you, please?	[]
Other	11	0	I don't think so. Nothing takes priority over Chocolate Rain.	[]
Other	15	0	Oh, here he goes with the ego again. Who crowned you the top Internet star?!	[]
Other	10	1	I did. When I became bigger than all you bitches.	['bitches']

Other	10	0	Stephen!, Stephen! They're here! They've come to negotiate!	[]
Other	4	0	What?! You mean it?!	[]
Kyle	4	0	Okay, we did it.	[]
Other	5	1	Who the hell are you?	['hell']
Stan	10	0	We're the ones you told to get Internet money.	[]
Kyle	12	0	Here.  We made ten million theoretical dollars. It's all for you.	[]
Other	13	0	Theoretical dollars? What am I supposed to do with that?!  You little timewasters!	[]
Stan	10	0	Hey, we worked really hard to get this theoretical money!	[]
Kyle	8	1	Yeah. Everyone thinks I'm a homo now.	['homo']
Cartman	5	1	...You are a homo, Butters.	['homo']
Kyle	14	0	Dude, will you just end this thing now?! My little brother is gonna die!	[]
Other	40	1	Nooooo! I'm not gonna look like an idiot! If I fucked up and led everyone astray, the last thing I'm going to do and admit it!  Yes, this is the head of the WGA. The World Canadian Bureau.	['fucked']
Other	19	0	Ah, Mr. Abootman. It's the global world summit leaders. We want to talk to you about the strike.	[]
Other	6	0	You... You do? You wanna negotiate?!	[]
Other	22	0	No, actually we were just wondering if, when you're all dead, we can use Newfoundland for a new global theme park.	[]
Kyle	9	0	Hello? Will you just give this guy something, please?!	[]
Other	2	0	Excuse me?	[]
Kyle	25	0	He just doesn't wanna look like an idiot, so he wants everyone to think the strike was for something. Just, just give him anything!	[]
Other	9	0	Well, we could give Canada some small consolation prize	[]
Kyle	11	0	If they give you something small, will you end the strike?	[]
Other	18	0	Will they... act like they're giving Canada a lot so everyone thinks I did a good job?	[]
Kyle	10	0	Can you act like you're giving him a lot?	[]
Other	3	0	Sure, why not?	[]
Other	3	0	We have won!	[]
Other	6	0	Well how much did we get?	[]
Other	54	0	Well, we uh, we didn't get everything that we wanted, but... we negotiated hard and... we got these...  coupons to Bennigan's! And...  free bubblegum... for every Canadian.  These coupons entitle every Canadian to a free meal at Bennigan's. With the purchase of a meal at equal or greater value, of course.	[]
Other	3	0	We did it!	[]
Other	10	0	My friends. This is the greatest victory in Canadian history.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Ike. Ike!  It's over.	[]
Ike	3	0	It's over?	[]
Kyle	4	0	Yeah. Here you go.	[]
Stan	9	0	Boy, I'm sure glad that's over with.	[]
Butters	2	0	Me too!	[]
Kyle	89	0	Yeah, but you know, I learned something today. We thought we could make money on the Internet. But, while the Internet is new and exciting for creative people, it hasn't matured as a distribution mechanism to the extent that one should trade real and immediate opportunities for income for the promise of future online revenue. It will be a few years before digital distribution of media on the Internet can be monetized to the extent that necessitates content producers to forgo their fair value in more traditional media.	[]
Stan	1	0	...Yeah.	[]
Other	7	0	Yeah, we did it! Celebrate, everyone! Woohoo!	[]
Other	27	0	Hold on a minute! Wait just a second!  We just did some calculating! By NOT working during the strike, Canadians lost more than 10.4 million dollars!	[]
Other	16	0	And our Bennigan's coupons and bubble gum is worth roughly... three thousand and eight dollars!	[]
Other	11	0	Don't look at that. Come on, friends, let's dance.	[]
Other	28	0	You had no idea what you were doing and now you're trying to make it look like you won so that we won't set you adrift!	[]
Other	31	1	Damn it friends, don't you see? We won for future Canadians, guy. So the little guy doesn't get pushed around anymore. This was a victory for Canada's respect.	['damn']
Other	8	0	Eh?! What do you think you're doing?!	[]
Other	6	0	We're setting you adrift, idiot!	[]
Other	8	0	Maybe you can go live with the Danish!	[]
Other	6	0	You'll regret this day, friend!	[]
Other	6	0	I'm not your friend, buddih!	[]
Other	6	0	I'm not your buddih, guy!	[]
Other	6	0	He's not your guy, friend!	[]
Other	6	0	I'm not your friend, buddih!	[]
Other	6	0	We're not your buddih, guy!	[]
Other	6	0	I'm not your guy, friend!	[]
