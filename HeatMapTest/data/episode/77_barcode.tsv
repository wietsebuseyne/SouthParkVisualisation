Butters	32	0	...And so, just like in nature, ah I can add the mixture into the volcano and...  O Pele! God of Fire! Show us you uh-  Aw, it's all uh g-gooey.	[]
Other	8	0	Okay, good job, Butters. You get a check.	[]
Butters	14	0	Ah, thank you, Ms. Choksondik!  I got a check. That's like a C!	[]
Other	13	0	Okay. Whose project should we look at next? How aboouuut Eric?  Eric Cartman?	[]
Cartman	3	0	Stand by, please.	[]
Other	2	0	NOW Eric!	[]
Cartman	3	1	Oh, god dammit!	['dammit']
Kyle	1	0	Haha!	[]
Cartman	29	1	Shutup, Jew!  Yes, well. For my project, I made a pencil, taped to a pen. In this way we see the duality of writing devices that occur in nature.	['jew']
Other	15	0	You just put that thing together just now! I'm giving you a check minus.	[]
Cartman	6	1	Oh GODDAMMIT I HATE CHECK-MINUS!	['goddammit']
Other	1	0	Siddown.	[]
Cartman	7	0	I'll make you eat your parents!	[]
Other	4	0	What did you say?!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Nothing!	[]
Other	5	0	Alright, Token, you're next.	[]
Token	43	0	Using my laptop computer, I hooked into the Internet and found a meteorology Web site.  I donwloaded the data, and with my dad's video projector, I can show you the graph I made of predictable weather patterns over the next three months.	[]
Clyde	1	0	Wwooww.	[]
Token	15	0	I also printed out the results on my color printer. Here you are, Ms. Choksondik.	[]
Other	9	0	Very very good, Token. You get a check plus.	[]
Token	1	0	Alright!	[]
Cartman	5	1	Aw, that is such bullcrap!	['bullcrap']
Other	6	0	Eric, for the love of God.	[]
Cartman	32	0	No! No, see, this is the fundamental flaw with the check check-plus check-minus system! The only reason Token was able to do all that is because his family is rich!	[]
Token	5	0	My family isn't rich.	[]
Cartman	32	0	Oh, come on, Token! Your new house is four times the size of anyone else's in town! And who else gets crab cakes and, and lobster tail in their lunch boxes?!	[]
Stan	5	0	Your family is rich, dude.	[]
Token	2	0	But I...	[]
Cartman	15	0	Let's just see where Token's clothes come from, shall we?  Ooooo, Armani Exchange!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Aharmani Exchange?	[]
Cartman	27	0	All the rest of us have to buy our clothes at J mart! Have you even been inside a J mart, Token?!  I didn't think so!	[]
Stan	13	0	Yeah, dude, your family is so rich they have their own pool table.	[]
Butters	13	0	Yeah. And their own sprinkler system. You don't think you're rich?	[]
Other	6	0	Hello Token. How was school today?	[]
Token	15	0	Mom? Dad? Why do we have a bigger house than everybody else in South Park?	[]
Other	7	0	Well, because we have more money, son.	[]
Token	4	0	I know. But why?	[]
Other	47	1	...W-well, because we went to graduate school and therefore have more lucrative jobs than most people in town. For instance, your mother is a chemist for a pharmaceutical company, whereas your friend Eric Cartman's mother is a crack whore. One pays more than the other.	['whore']
Other	6	0	Why, sweetie? What's the matter?	[]
Token	14	0	All the kids at school made fun of me today because I'm rich.	[]
Other	1	0	...Oh.	[]
Token	22	0	I don't wanna be rich anymore! I wanna eat macaroni and cheese for dinner and, and wear clothes from J mart!	[]
Other	2	0	J mart?	[]
Other	10	0	Son, you, you don't know what you're saying.	[]
Token	17	0	I just wanna be like all the other kids in South Park. Please, Mom and Dad, please.	[]
Other	8	0	You... sure you want to do this, son?	[]
Token	3	0	I'm sure.	[]
Other	1	0	Hmmm...	[]
Other	4	0	Where's the... valet?	[]
Other	8	0	He must be parkiing someone else's car.	[]
Other	24	0	Ah, here we go.  Take good care of it, please.  Here's twenty dollars.  Hoh?  They've activated some kind of alien blinding device.	[]
Token	11	0	That's not a blinding device, Dad. It's fluorescent lighting.	[]
Other	1	0	Oh.	[]
Other	13	0	Excuse me, where can where would we find young men's fashion apparel?	[]
Other	6	0	Aisle 6, next to the pretzels.	[]
Other	3	0	Next to the-?!	[]
Token	19	0	Come on!  Hey look: there pants are only five bucks apiece. They must really suck. What do ya think?	[]
Other	5	0	What, what brand are they?	[]
Token	10	0	It doesn't matter, Mom. They're poor people pants.	[]
Randy	8	0	Hey, uh, Sharon? Isn't that the Williamses?	[]
Other	18	0	Huh?  Oh. Yeah, it is.  What are they doing here? They can afford to shop at Cherry Creek.	[]
Other	10	0	Do you see that, Sheila? The Williamses are shopping here.	[]
Other	16	0	I don't get it. He must pull in at least two hundred thousand a year.	[]
Other	17	0	S-son, can you just hurry it up? I don't think we quite fit n here.	[]
Cartman	15	0	Oh, looks like you landed on Park Avenue, Stan. You own me ten million dollars.	[]
Token	3	0	Hey you guys.	[]
Stan	8	0	Oh hey, dude. Did you bring the movie?	[]
Token	3	0	I sure did.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Hey, you changed your clothes, Token.	[]
Token	12	0	Yeah, well, you know, I did a little shopping at J mart.	[]
Stan	13	0	Alright, well, let's just watch the Lion King. Cartman's cheating anyway.	[]
Token	3	0	Here you go.	[]
Stan	3	0	What's that?	[]
Token	8	0	It's a DVD of the Lion King	[]
Stan	8	0	DVD? We don't own a DVD player.	[]
Kyle	8	0	Yeah, dude.  Nobody does. They're too expensive.	[]
Cartman	10	1	Not too expensive for Token's rich ass family, apparently.	['ass']
Craig	8	0	Don't you have a VHS of it?	[]
Token	4	0	I only have this.	[]
Cartman	19	0	Oh, well, let me take this disk up to the Enterprise and see if Captain Kirk can decrypt it.	[]
Token	4	0	What's a VHS?	[]
Cartman	3	0	Oh, Jesus, dude.	[]
Stan	13	0	Come on, guys. We'll just have to find other stuff to do.	[]
Kyle	4	0	What's a VHS?	[]
Token	141	0	Why can't I be like all the other kids? They all have three-bedroom homes, broken trucks on their lawns. And cut-up hot dogs for lunch It's not my fault my parents succeed so much. There's no one in town I can relate to. I play with autographed baseball bats while everyone else just plays with sticks and pine cones Has a boy ever felt so alone? Well, who needs them anyway? I won't pretend to be something I'm not If I can't be poor, I've got to deal with what I've got. If I can't be like them, what I need is more rich kids around, So I'm not the only one, and then I won't be so... down. Please, God, send more rich kids... To my... Town	[]
Other	21	0	Ooo, look at this, honey.  A beautiful unspoiled town in the Rockies. This is just what we've been looking for!	[]
Other	8	0	Like Aspen was 30 years ago. Sounds nice.	[]
Other	21	0	We could buy hundreds of acres of land for next to nothing! And then I could finally live like a cowboy.	[]
Other	14	0	Oh Will, the country would be such a nicer place to raise our kids!	[]
Other	2	0	O kids?	[]
Other	2	0	Yes, Daddy?	[]
Other	10	0	How would you like to move to the Colorado Rockies?	[]
Other	3	0	The mountains, Daddy?	[]
Other	4	0	Can we have horses?	[]
Other	6	0	O can we? Can we Daddy?	[]
Other	2	0	You bet!	[]
Other	1	0	Hooray!	[]
Other	8	0	Well, here it is. Our home to be.	[]
Other	5	0	Oh, Will, it's beautiful.	[]
Token	5	0	Hi! Welcome to the neighborhood!	[]
Other	9	0	Why thank you, young man. We're the Smiths.	[]
Other	22	0	Ah, a local boy. You shall be our new playmate. I'm Frederick. This is my sister Lisa, and my brother Daniel	[]
Token	3	0	I'm Token.	[]
Other	12	0	Our daddy is a very famous actor. What does your daddy do?	[]
Token	7	0	Aah, he's a lawyer. I think.	[]
Other	20	0	How quaint. Kids, why don't you play with little Token while your mother and I check out the town.	[]
Other	13	0	Very well. Come, local boy.  Show us how to play your mountain games.	[]
Token	4	0	All right!  Thanks, God.	[]
Token	17	0	...And this is the room where my mom and dad keep their original v-Van Gogh painting.	[]
Other	17	0	Yes, yes, we have one of those, too. In fact, we have seven of them, I believe.	[]
Token	6	0	You do? God, that's great!	[]
Other	1	0	Why?	[]
Token	31	0	I'm just so happy you guys moved into town. You see, I used to be the only rich kid. All the other families here are kinda  low to  middle-income.	[]
Other	7	0	Why? What happened to all their money?	[]
Token	7	0	Well, they never really had any money.	[]
Other	12	0	Well, then, why don't their daddies just act in a movie?	[]
Token	5	0	Well I... think that.. they...	[]
Other	9	0	Sometimes children must be very firm with their daddies.	[]
Other	1	0	Indeed.	[]
Other	18	0	Like when Daddy doesn't want to act in a movie because he thinks the script is bad.	[]
Other	15	0	So we must plead with him:  Please, Daddy, please! It's twenty million dollard, Daddy.	[]
Other	3	0	Please, Daddy, please!	[]
Other	9	0	Twenty million is still twelve million after taxes, Daddy!	[]
Other	5	0	I want a llama, Daddy!	[]
Other	6	0	I'd do the picture, Daddy!	[]
Other	2	0	Please, Daddy!	[]
Other	2	0	Daddy, please!	[]
Other	5	0	Daddy, do the movie, Daddy!	[]
Other	2	0	But Daddy!	[]
Other	6	0	And so Daddy does the picture.	[]
Token	3	0	...That's ...great.	[]
Other	4	0	Twenty million dollars great.	[]
Other	26	0	I found a girl who had an innie and I felt her with my jimmyPlayer-haters try to do me 'cause my rhymes are just tooo-	[]

Other	6	0	Oh.  William! How are you buddy?	[]
Other	5	0	Great, Snoop Dogg, and you?	[]
Other	15	0	Couldn't be better. I'm just laying down some vocals for my new album.	[]
Other	26	0	Great, Snoop-Snoop. Listen: Remember how we always talked about wanting to buy property up in the mountains so our kids could ski and ride horses?	[]
Other	11	0	Oho yes, the kids bug me about it all the time.	[]
Other	19	0	Well I found the place, Snooty-roo. It's in the Rockies, but totally undiscovered, laid-back, and beautiful.	[]
Other	4	0	Ogh. It sounds lovely!	[]
Other	21	0	You really should come give it a look. Jada and I would love for some friends to move here with us.	[]
Other	25	0	I certainly will, William. And perhaps I'll give ol' Maigc and Kobe Bryant a call. They've been looking for vacation properties as well.	[]
Other	11	0	Great! Well, let me let you get back to your recording.	[]
Other	5	0	Hah, see you soon. Bye.	[]

Other	20	1	Alright, let's take it from the top, gang. I shout Hell Yeah! from my vehicle. Livin' is a miracle-	['hell']
Mr. Garrison	34	0	Look, there's more of them moving into our town.  You know, Oprah Winfrey is building a house up on Cannon, and some Snoop Doggy Doo Doo buildin' a gigantic place up on Main.	[]
Other	5	0	Yep, there goes the neighborhood.	[]
Mr. Garrison	25	0	That's the fifth family of them that's moved here. Seems like all of a sudden South Park is being overrun by those types.	[]

Other	12	0	Oh. I don't take kindly to rich folk. Neither does Ned.	[]

Other	21	0	I remember back in the day, RICH folk weren't alLOWED in South Park! Now thery're movin' here in droves!	[]
Other	19	0	They're gonna be sending their kids to our schools, and mixin' them with our pure, non-rich kids!	[]
Mr. Garrison	25	0	Oh, yeah, and it won't be long before they drove all of us poor underachieving people out of town with inflated real-estate costs!	[]
Other	6	1	Damn, I hate those stupid richers!	['damn']
Mr. Garrison	23	0	Yeah.  Hey, rich guy!  Hey, Richie Rich! Yeah, I'm talkin' to you, richer! What's in the huge box, richer?! Your checkbook?	[]
Other	24	0	Yeah. How many rich people does it take to screw in a light bulb? None! They can hire people to do it for them!	[]
Mr. Garrison	40	0	Yeah. Hey, hey, you guys know why richers have such big garages? 'Cause they need a place for all their Porsches and boats and aircraft carriers!  Yeah, that's right, cashchucker! Go have fun with your two million dollar house!	[]

Other	19	0	...Maybe you didn't see the sign out front: This bar is for people livin' below their means ONLY!	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Other	13	0	This is a free country. I can have a drink wherever I want.	[]
Other	7	0	Come on, Kobe, let's just go.	[]
Mr. Garrison	17	0	Those richers are getting snooty. We've got to show those richers they're not welcome here!	[]
Other	5	0	Nn-what do you mean?	[]
Mr. Garrison	25	0	How about tonight, we sneak up to one of their houses, and right on their lawn we'll set fire to a big lowercase t!	[]
Other	2	0	Lowercase t?	[]
Mr. Garrison	5	0	Yeah, for time to leave!	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Mr. Garrison	24	0	Jimbo, you take some folk and build a big wooden lowercase t! I'll take the rest and get some gas and torches ready!	[]

Other	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Other	18	0	Now Token, polo is very simple. You simply must hit the williard into some cilium with your fracaman.	[]
Token	12	0	Well, yeah, but can't we just play without these uncomfortable uniforms?	[]
Other	40	1	Can't we play without the uniforms? Yes, um. Lert's eat caviar without Bellini's as well!  Now come, Token, and remember: it doesn't matter who wins. It matters who wins three times in a row. Tally ho!	['ho']
Other	2	1	Tally ho!	['ho']
Other	1	0	Oh!	[]
Other	1	0	Yay!	[]
Other	3	0	This is exciting.	[]
Other	5	0	Oh, Frederick, this is wonderful!	[]
Cartman	7	1	What in the hell are they doing?	['hell']
Kyle	3	0	Is that fun?	[]
Stan	14	0	I don't know. We don't have horses, so we can't play.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Well, let's just play our game, then.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Alright.	[]
Cartman	12	1	Alright, I'll start. I'll kick you in the nuts, Kenny!	['nuts']
Kenny	1	0	(Ow!)	[]
Kyle	8	1	I'll kick you in the nuts, Stan!	['nuts']
Stan	8	1	I'll kick you in the nuts, Cartman!	['nuts']
Cartman	3	0	Kick his nutsack!	[]
Other	17	0	You see, you must pay attention, Token. I was able to jollyrow your davishmere with a forecastle.	[]
Token	12	0	This game is too confusing. How about we have a snowball fight?	[]
Other	3	0	A snowball fight?	[]
Other	2	0	How barbaric.	[]
Other	17	0	Yes, Token, if you want to play such savage games, I suggest you go live with lions.	[]
Token	6	0	I don't fit in anywhere.	[]
Other	25	0	Hey! What are you doing? If you're going to ride the bus in South Park, you're gonna have to sit in the FRONT!	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah	[]
Other	9	0	Yeah, that's where the first-class seating is!	[]
Other	7	0	Yeah. How do you like that, richer?!	[]
Other	6	0	Well it's very nice, actually	[]
Other	6	0	Yeah, I'll bet it is!	[]
Other	3	0	Very, very comfy.	[]
Other	5	0	Uh huh, looks like it.	[]
Token	77	0	Hello, my name is Token. I don't fit in with all the kids at South Park Elementary so, I invited a bunch of rich kids to move to town. The problem is, I don't fit in with them, either. That's why I've come to live with you.  So if you'll have me and raise me as one of your own, I promise to be the best lion I could be.  Uuuh, yeah.	[]
Chef	12	0	Shovel that snow, babih, it's all nice, heavy and wet. Just-	[]
Other	6	0	We shall perservere. We shall perservere.	[]
Other	6	0	You there, come march with us!	[]
Chef	2	0	For what?	[]
Other	16	0	All the poor people in town think they can persecute and harass us decent rich folk.	[]
Other	10	0	So we're uniting and marching on the town square!	[]
Other	4	0	The Million Millionaire March!	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Other	3	0	Come on, brother!	[]
Chef	5	0	But... I'm not rich.	[]
Other	1	0	What?	[]
Chef	14	0	I'm just a school cafeteria chef. Ahah I don't make much money.	[]
Other	7	0	We'll give you a hundred dollars.	[]
Chef	5	0	Woo, fudge the snow now.	[]
Other	6	0	We shall perservere. We shall perservere.	[]
Chef	6	0	I shall perservere. We shall perservere.	[]
Token	1	0	RRrrr!!	[]
Other	7	0	Look at the little black lion, Mommy.	[]
Other	6	0	He's cute, isn't he?	[]
Token	1	0	Roar!	[]
Other	6	0	What are you doing here, boy?	[]
Token	13	0	You- you talked. I, I understood you. I must be becoming a lion!	[]
Other	17	0	You're not becoming a lion. The only way you can do that is to see Aslan.	[]
Token	3	0	Who's Aslan?	[]
Other	5	0	Very well, walk this way.	[]
Other	11	0	Is this the boy who's been living in our realm?	[]
Other	1	0	Yes.	[]
Token	3	0	Are... you... Aslan?	[]
Other	3	0	M-I am.	[]
Token	4	0	Well, I'm Token	[]
Other	10	0	So, you want to live with the lions, do you?	[]
Token	11	0	Yes. Um. Great Aslan. I don't fit in anywhere else.	[]
Other	11	0	And what makes you think you can fit it with us?	[]
Token	5	0	Well, I don't know.	[]
Other	4	0	Do you like jokes?	[]
Token	1	0	What?	[]
Other	9	0	Jokes! You know, funny, hahaaa. Us lions love jokes.	[]
Token	5	0	...I like jokes a lot.	[]
Other	48	8	Mmm. Then there may be hoipe in you yet, young apprentice lion. Very well. We wihill let you stay, if... you can pull this thorn from my paw.  Go on, try it. Pull my thorn! Come on! Pull my thorm!  Ho ho ho ho ho ho! Ho ho!	['ho', 'ho', 'ho', 'ho', 'ho', 'ho', 'ho', 'ho']
Token	4	0	So can I stay?	[]
Other	13	0	He-you may. But being a lion may be harder than you think.	[]
Other	53	0	A billion billionaires are gathering their ranks and will be marchng on the town square tonight  in South Park to petition the end of separate bars, bus seating and restaurants. It looks like it will be a great turnout, as some of the millionaires also paid several thousand Mexicans to march for them.	[]
Other	10	0	If they get that petition passed, it's all over.	[]
Other	17	0	I guess we learned our lesson: you can't fight rich folk; they're just too powerful.	[]
Mr. Garrison	9	0	Now, come on! Is that any way to talk?	[]
Other	11	0	They won, Garrison. They can't be scared out of town.	[]
Mr. Garrison	20	0	No! We just haven't scared them the right way! Think about it. What scares rich people more than anything?	[]
Other	1	0	...Ghosts?	[]
Mr. Garrison	17	0	Bingo! Rich people don't want to live in South Park if they think it's HAUNTED!	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Mr. Garrison	19	0	Everyonen get some sheets from home! If we can't chase the richers out, we'll spook 'em out!	[]
Other	6	0	Alright! Yeah! Let's Go! Right!	[]
Token	2	0	Huuuunh  Aslan.	[]
Other	7	0	Yes? What is it, young lion apprentice?	[]
Token	8	0	...I thnk I'm gonna go home now.	[]
Other	12	0	Home. But I thought your friends made fun of you at home.	[]
Token	49	0	They do. But, I guess I learned something today. You see, even though kids at South Park make fun of me, I still like hanging around them more than snobby rich kids or, lions. Even though I may be different from them, I still like my old friends best.	[]
Other	23	0	It sounds like you learned much, young lion apprentice. Very well. But before you go, perhaps you would like... a stick of gum?	[]
Token	2	0	...No thanks.	[]
Other	5	0	Go on. It's spearmint!	[]
Token	21	0	No, because there's a spring in there, and if I pull the gum out, it's gonna hurt my finger.	[]
Other	16	0	Oh. So you don't want any gum then? Are you... sure? Go on, try it!	[]
Token	1	0	Ow.	[]
Other	4	0	That is good stuhuff!	[]
Token	3	0	Jesus, lions suck!	[]
Other	22	0	And so it is with great determination that us decent rich Americans have gathered to say: We will be separated no more!	[]
Other	1	0	Hooray!	[]
Other	20	0	This certainly has been an enlightening evening. And as Mayor, I accept your petition and will abolish all separation laws.	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Other	21	0	And I want to assure the nation that is watching that South Park is not a town of prejudice or bigotry.	[]
Other	1	0	Woooooo!!	[]

Token	4	0	That's right, huh?	[]
Kyle	8	0	And Stan for being in love with Wendy.	[]
Stan	6	0	Yeah, I get it for that.	[]
Kyle	5	1	And Cartman for being fat.	['fat']
Cartman	2	0	Uh huh.	[]
