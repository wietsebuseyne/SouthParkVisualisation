Other	20	0	He's still lookin' good! His name is Jared His name is Jared and he likes to eat the sandwiches...	[]
Butters	3	0	Uh, hey, fellas.	[]
Stan	2	0	Hey Kenny	[]
Butters	23	0	Now gosh darnit, my name's not Kenny! Kenny's dead, and you're all gonna have to learn to deal with it!	[]
Kyle	3	0	Okay, Not-Kenny.	[]
Other	18	0	Hey South Park!  You can meet Jared IN PERSON March 6 at the Kenny McCormick Memorial Town Square!	[]
Butters	7	0	Woh, boy! Jared's comin' to town!	[]
Kyle	4	0	Dude! That's today!	[]
Stan	10	0	We've gotta get down there! Come on, Not-Kenny!	[]
Butters	9	0	Now gosh darnit, my name's not Not-Kenny!	[]
Cartman	6	0	Okay, come on, Not-Not-Kenny.	[]
Butters	7	0	Wo-ah I'm getting steamed now.	[]
Other	10	0	Hello! City Wok! City Wok, I take your order prease!	[]
Kyle	7	0	Excuse me? Could we get through here?	[]
Other	25	1	Hell no! I've been savin' this spot for six hours!  His name is Garrison, Mr. Garrison. He lost ten pounds takin' Jared's lead-	['hell']
Randy	3	0	Here he comes!	[]
Other	10	0	He's still lookin' good, with all those... sub sandwiches...	[]
Other	38	0	Thank you all so much. You know what? After a year of eating delicious sub sandwiches, I've proven weight loss is easy!  And I promise you, I will always be your faithful leader in easy weight loss!	[]
Other	1	0	Alright!	[]
Cartman	15	0	That guy ate all the sandwiches he wanted and lost weight. He is so cool.	[]
Other	13	0	Mr. Vogle, some fans wanted to see if you'd sign their sandwich?	[]
Other	6	0	Sure, let 'em in.  Hi kids.	[]
Butters	2	0	Wow, Jared!	[]
Kyle	13	0	Dude! Did you really lose all that weight eating nothing but sub sandwiches?	[]
Other	16	0	I sure did! And- Well- Well I, I also had a little help on the side.	[]
Stan	4	0	What kind of help?	[]
Other	24	0	Well, eating sub sandwiches was a big part of it. But the way that I lost so much weight was that I got aides.	[]
Cartman	2	0	A- AIDS?	[]
Other	28	0	That's right. I got aides about two years ago and I've been losing weight ever since. It's amazing how slim you can get with aides.	[]
Stan	5	0	I'll bet you can.	[]
Other	6	0	Would you like to meet them?	[]
Kyle	1	0	Them?	[]
Other	14	0	My aides. Scott! Tyler!  Scott is my personal trainer  and Tyler is my dietitian.	[]
Other	1	0	Hello.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Oh, A I D E S, aides.	[]
Other	4	0	Yep. Hooray for aides!	[]
Kyle	11	0	Well, that's not really what you say in the commercial.	[]
Other	44	0	I know. You kinda have to read the fine print at the bottom of the screen. It says I only ate a half-sized lean turkey sandwich with no mustard or mayo or anything like that and then had proper diet and exercise aides.	[]
Kyle	26	0	But you're lying to people. If they knew that you didn't eat just all the sandwiches you want, you might not be so popular.	[]
Other	9	0	Y- you think so. Well, why... should it matter?	[]
Kyle	3	0	It matters, dude.	[]
Other	1	0	Hmmm.	[]
Kyle	20	1	That penisbutt didn't lose weight eating sub sandwiches. He lost weight because he ate less of them and exercised.	['penisbutt']
Stan	26	0	Yeah, it's only in America that somebody can become famous just because they go from being a big fatass to not being a big fatass.	[]
Cartman	20	0	Oh-my-god!  You guys! I think I'm having a genius moment. Yes. Yes! Its coming to me now.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Tha- that's diarrhea.	[]
Cartman	54	0	Noo. Don't you see what this all means? Anybody could do what he did. What's to stop someone else from going to say, City Wok, and cutting a deal with them? Say they'll eat nothing but their Chinese food, but then eat only a little tiny bit of it and exercise.	[]
Stan	11	0	Then City Wok could say their food makes them lose weight.	[]
Cartman	12	0	That's right Stan.  It's a cash cow, I tell you.	[]
Kyle	5	0	That's a great idea!	[]
Cartman	20	0	Lose weight and make money... I tell you this is gonna be the greatest thing that Butters has ever done.	[]
Butters	1	0	Me?!	[]
Cartman	13	0	Weh- who do you think I'm talkin' about, Butters? Joyce de Witt?	[]
Butters	13	1	Oh, no, I thought you meant you. Eh, you're the fat one.	['fat']
Cartman	22	1	I can't lose weight, Butters, 'cause I'm not fat. I'm big-boned. You can't slim down bones, stupid!	['fat']
Kyle	5	1	But Butters isn't fat.	['fat']
Cartman	24	0	That's my whole point. First we fatten him up, then we make the deal with City Wok, then take the weight back off.	[]
Stan	18	0	He's right. If Butters is naturally skinny, he'll be able to take the weight off faster.	[]
Butters	11	1	But fellas, if I get fat my parents will ground me.	['fat']
Cartman	11	0	Oh, come on! Just think about how famous you'll be!	[]
Butters	4	0	You mean like Jared?	[]
Kyle	8	0	Yeah dude! You'll be just like Jared!	[]
Butters	12	2	Well the heck with that! You said Jared was a penis-butt!	['penis', 'butt']
Stan	38	2	You wouldn't be a penis-butt, Butters, you'd be famous. Just think about all those people following you around, singing songs to you just because you lost some weight...  His name is Butters, it's Butters.	['penis', 'butt']
Cartman	9	1	He used to be fat but not no more	['fat']
Kyle	9	0	City Wok brought him down to a size 4.	[]
Stan	9	0	Now, he's got lots of moneys and girls	[]
Cartman	9	0	and a lifetime of free food at City Wok.	[]
Butters	1	0	Wow.	[]
Other	17	0	Christine, you know I love you very much, and I, I can't wait for the wedding.	[]
Other	25	0	I love you too, Jared. You've changed my whole life. Her name is Jonez, Christine Jonez She lost forty pounds when she met Jared-	[]
Other	37	0	Yeh, I know I know, I know. But uh... some young boys were talkin' to me earlier, and... it made me think that people might not be so proud of my weight loss if they knew something.	[]
Other	6	0	Jared, what's this all about?	[]
Other	16	0	Uh, Christine, this isn't probably gonna matter to you at all, but... I have aides.	[]
Other	1	0	What?!	[]
Other	21	0	Yeah, I have aides. I've had aides since before we were together.  What, what are you thinking? Are you bummed?	[]
Other	14	0	Am I bummed?!  You've had AIDS all this time and you knew it?!	[]
Other	6	0	Well of course I knew it.	[]
Other	8	1	Why the hell wouldn't you tell me?!	['hell']
Other	11	0	I didn't think it was that big of a deal.	[]
Other	10	0	Not that big of a deal?! I slept with you!	[]
Other	7	0	Aren't you overreacting a little bit?	[]
Other	9	0	Well, Jesus Christ! We're supposed to get married!	[]
Other	67	0	We can still get married Christine, I mean, sure, they're my aides now, but after we get married... they'll be our aides  You'll love having aides, Christine, you really will. And when we have children, they'll have aides. It'll make things so simple!  Christine!  Jeez, those boys were right. People really don't like aides. I'd better tell everyone the truth.	[]
Chef	3	0	Hello there, children.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Chef, we need Butters to gain about fifty pounds fast.	[]
Chef	3	0	Fifty pounds? Why?	[]
Cartman	3	0	Uuuh, school project.	[]
Chef	21	1	Well, if you want him to get really fat as fast as possible, one of you will have to marry him.	['fat']
Stan	2	0	Marry him?	[]
Chef	9	0	It definitely worked for every woman I ever met.	[]
Butters	14	0	Oh, no, no, no! I ain't gettin' married; my parents will ground me!	[]
Kyle	7	0	Yeah, none of us wanna marry Butters.	[]
Butters	9	0	Well, uh, how come? What's wrong with me?	[]
Chef	18	0	Well, I guess we're gonna have to do this the old-fashioned way. Come on back, children.	[]
Butters	9	0	Ugh.  Wuh, wuh, I can't eat no more.	[]
Kyle	8	0	You have to! Here, have some more mayonnaise.	[]
Stan	5	0	Chef, we need more food.	[]
Chef	5	0	I'm runnin' out, children.	[]
Cartman	15	1	Damnit Butters! Keep eating or I'll kick you till you're deader than Kenny!	['damnit']
Stan	18	0	Dude, that isn't cool. You shouldn't joke about Kenny being dead. Enough time hasn't passed.	[]
Cartman	9	0	So how long until we can joke about it?	[]
Kyle	17	0	Twenty-two point three years. That's how long it takes for something tragic to become funny.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Wugh, that's a long time to wait.	[]
Butters	14	0	Wull I can't eat no more. I-I just keep pukin' it up.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Then eat your puke.	[]
Butters	1	0	No!	[]
Cartman	7	0	Oh, come on! Japanese girls do it.	[]
Other	28	0	Ladies and gentlemen, we at Subway are happy to inform you that Jared has elected to stay in South Park in order to speak to you once again!	[]
Other	9	0	He's going to speak with us once again!	[]
Other	5	0	So, here he is, Jared!	[]
Other	11	0	He's still lookin' good, eatin' them sandwiches all the time...	[]
Other	19	0	Thank you-hoo, thank you all. Subway's is a healthy way to eat fast food and lose weight!	[]
Other	2	0	All right!	[]
Other	24	0	But,  I feel like I need to come a little clean about something, uh-... it wasn't just Subway sandwiches that made me thin.	[]
Other	1	0	...Huh?	[]
Other	17	0	The reason I was able to lose so much weight so quickly was that I got aides.	[]
Other	1	0	Huh?	[]
Other	1	0	What?	[]
Other	4	0	Did he say AIDS?	[]
Other	28	0	But I still wanna be the leader in a fitter America, and so I'm here to tell you, that you should ALL go out and get aides!	[]
Other	3	0	Oh my God!	[]
Other	3	0	Is he serious?	[]
Other	27	1	Having aides - is - awesome! With aides you can literally watch the fat melt away! And with the proper mix of aides and Subway sandwiches, anything is possible!	['fat']
Other	15	0	Uh, the opinions expressed by Mr. Vogle are not necessarily those of the Subway Company.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Wow! He looks great!	[]
Stan	5	0	How do you feel, Butters?	[]
Butters	7	0	W-well, k-kinda like Cartman.  Aw!	[]
Cartman	6	0	Get a hold of yourself, man!	[]
Stan	8	0	Alright, now it's time for phase 2.	[]
Other	11	2	Welcome to Shitty Wok. You rike to try Shitty Chicken today?	['shitty', 'shitty']
Cartman	13	0	Sir, we have come to offer you the business deal of a lifetime.	[]
Other	5	1	You want the Shitty Beef?	['shitty']
Kyle	25	2	Nope. We wanna show the world how healthy your food is. Our fat friend here is going to lose forty pounds eating at Shitty Wok.	['fat', 'shitty']
Other	7	1	Which one? I see two fat friends.	['fat']
Cartman	3	1	The fat one!	['fat']
Stan	23	0	We're gonna take before and after photos, and then, when he gets skinny from eating your food, we'll show the world.	[]
Other	1	0	...Why?	[]
Kyle	12	0	Because then you can pay us to use our friend in commercials.	[]
Other	6	0	Oh! You mean like-a Jared?!	[]
Cartman	3	0	Just like Jared.	[]
Other	35	2	His name is Jared, he lose some weight. Shitty Wok food sure is great. Yeah, okay. That sound good. Saw if he lose weight eating Shitty Wok, I pay use to use him in commercial.	['shitty', 'shitty']
Other	2	0	All right!	[]
Cartman	5	0	Sir, we are in business!	[]
Other	23	0	Jared, first of all we want to say that all of us here at Subway appreciate everything you've done for our company.	[]
Other	12	0	Well, I appreciate your company doing everything it's done for me.	[]
Other	28	0	Yes, well, it is now the opinion of all of us that perhaps it would be best for you to take your... strange theories on weight loss elsewhere.	[]
Other	6	0	...'Scuse me... am I being fired?	[]
Other	19	0	Jared, it's just that your new take on weight loss is contrary to our commitment to good health.	[]
Other	2	0	How so?	[]
Other	18	0	Well, your new slogan, for instance.  When it comes to fitness, Subway goes hand in hand with aides.	[]
Other	2	0	Ah-hah.	[]
Other	12	0	His name is Jared. Jared lost weight eating Subway and... sandwiches of...	[]
Cartman	40	1	Come on, Butters, you gotta get skinny again!  You are such a flabby hunk of crap! Look at those jelly rolls! Jelly rolls I tell ya!! You still got seven chins, boah! You'll never be thin!! Nobody loves you!	['crap']
Butters	18	1	Wuh hey now, they do too! Uh, my mom and dad - love me even if I am fat.	['fat']
Cartman	11	0	Butters, I'm just trying to offer some motivational help here.	[]
Butters	3	0	Well alright then.	[]
Cartman	18	2	Row you fat bitch! Look at those jelly rolls! Nobody loves you! You're not even a person!	['fat', 'bitch']
Other	18	0	I never asked to be famous; now everyone hates me! I almost wish I had never gotten aides!	[]
Other	10	0	Hey now, come on. What kind of talk is that?	[]
Other	16	0	I'm sorry, guys, but I...I think I wanna be aides-free for a while.	[]
Other	10	0	Come on, Jared, lighten up! People don't hate you.	[]
Other	17	0	Yeah. Maybe they're all just jealous that they can't afford to hire their own aides.	[]
Other	17	0	Wait a minute... you're right!  Yeah! I think I know how to be a celebrity again!	[]
Stan	5	0	Did you bring the camera?	[]
Kyle	5	0	Yeah, we're all set.	[]
Cartman	13	0	Guys, I think this might be a good time to discuss some business.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Well, what do you mean?	[]
Cartman	25	0	Well, when City Wok sees how skinny Butters is, they're not gonna want him to just make one commercial, they're gonna want several.	[]
Stan	11	0	That's true. Jared did like a hundred for Subway Sandwiches.	[]
Cartman	24	0	I think we're looking at a non-exclusive two-year fifty-picture deal here. My calculations put that at about four million dollars.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Wow!	[]
Cartman	36	0	Now, I think the four million should be split evenly among the three of us, except that I should get a twenty percent per negation fee off the gross for having come up with the idea.	[]
Butters	2	0	Hey fellas.	[]
Stan	7	1	Butters?! What the hell are you doing?!	['hell']
Kyle	5	1	Yeah, you're still fat!	['fat']
Butters	11	0	Well, I know, ah I can't seem to lose it.	[]
Cartman	14	2	Well we're supposed to shoot your commercial today, you fat piece of crap!	['fat', 'crap']
Butters	18	0	Well ah I don't know what to tell ya. Losin' weight is harder than puttin' it on.	[]
Cartman	6	1	No it isn't, stupid blubberbutt!	['blubberbutt']
Stan	13	0	Did you eat only once ounce of City Wok like we told you?!	[]
Butters	9	0	Well uh yeah, but ah, I don't know...	[]
Kyle	7	0	Why are you doing this to us?!	[]
Stan	5	0	All prepared for liposuction surgery?	[]
Cartman	1	0	Check.	[]
Butters	8	0	Uh, I don't know about this, fellas.	[]
Stan	13	0	Hey, you're the one who screwed us by not losing weight, Butters.	[]
Kyle	25	0	Okay, it says here the operation begins with a one-inch incision in the ab-do-men on the left side just above the hip.	[]
Cartman	5	0	That should blah  ah- here.	[]
Butters	1	0	Woahhh!	[]
Cartman	12	1	Oh stop your bitchin' Butters! Kenny woulda took it like a man!	['bitchin']
Kyle	15	0	Okay, now put one end of the tube a half an inch into the incision.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Alrighty.	[]
Butters	12	0	Whoa. I think this is a bad idea, fellas. I feel woozy.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Alright, I think it's in.	[]
Kyle	11	1	The liposuction is a process of siphoning out the excess fat.	['fat']
Cartman	2	0	Bohogh, egh.	[]
Butters	1	0	Waaaahh!	[]
Cartman	3	0	There it goes.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Alright, it's working!	[]
Cartman	18	0	Aw man, it tastes like that, um, you know that cream-chipped-beef stuff that Chef makes sometimes.	[]
Butters	9	0	Aahh heh ahh, I don't feel very good.	[]
Stan	9	1	Shut up, Butters, it's your own damned fault.	['damned']
Butters	4	0	Everything's getting dark...	[]
Stan	6	0	We've gotta hurry this up.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Oh yeah, keep doing that. That's working good.	[]
Stan	4	0	He's losing weight.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Oh, whoa. Whoa!	[]
Kyle	5	0	It's out of control!	[]
Butters	5	0	Whoa, everything's getting sparkly.	[]
Stan	7	0	Oh no, dude, Butters' parents are home.	[]
Cartman	2	1	Oh, crap!	['crap']
Stan	2	0	Dude, bail!	[]
Other	2	0	Butters? Butters?!	[]
Butters	2	0	Mom. Dad.	[]
Other	10	0	Butters. Are you having liposuction surgery? Tell me the truth!	[]
Butters	2	0	Yes sir.	[]
Other	20	0	This is unbelievable! How many times have we told you not to have self-perform liposuction surgery in our house?!	[]
Butters	3	0	Four times, mom.	[]
Other	16	0	Well, I guess that wasn't enough! You get up to your room right now, mister!	[]
Butters	2	0	Yes, sir.	[]
Other	16	0	Oh, huh- Don't you give us that look young man! You're gonna get it!	[]
Other	55	0	Tom, I'm standing out in front of the Mayor's office, where the big liar, Jared, is once again about to speak. Apparently, Jared hopes to regain his celebrity hero status, which was lost when he announced that it was AIDS, not sub sandwiches, that caused him to lose weight. Let's listen in.	[]
Other	65	0	Ladies and gentlemen, a-at first I didn't understand why you felt betrayed by the fact that my aides helped me to lose weight, but now I understand that it isn't fair that- I had aides and most of you don't. And so, with all the money I've made from commercials, I have decided to start the Aides for Everyone Foundation!	[]
Other	1	0	What?!	[]
Other	17	0	I am going to personally see to it that each and every one of you gets aides!	[]
Other	4	0	This guy's insane.	[]
Other	29	0	But I won't stop there. I'm gonna seek out all the underprivileged and hungry children of the world, and I'm going to give them aides myself!	[]
Chef	6	0	You're gonna give children AIDS?!	[]
Other	20	0	Yes, it is my hope that every beautiful child on this earth has aides by next month! Aides for everyone!	[]
Other	2	0	Get him!	[]
Stan	6	0	Come on, Butters. Time to go.	[]
Butters	3	0	Uh- go where?	[]
Kyle	10	0	To City Wok so we can make our money. God!	[]
Butters	14	0	I can't go anywhere, fellas. I've been grounded for havin' liposuction... surgery.	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Butters	25	0	Wuh well I told you my parents would be sore, and they said for... havin' liposuction surgery, I can't play outside for five days.	[]
Cartman	21	0	Dude, we just need you to come down to City Wok real quick so they can see how skinny you are!	[]
Butters	41	1	Well you guys have already got me in Dutch for gettin' fat, and then I got in double-Dutch for... havin' liposuction, and now you're askin' me to be in triple Dutch?!  Huh-uh! I'll never be that Dutch!	['fat']
Stan	5	0	...Kenny would have done it.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Yep.	[]
Cartman	26	0	Do you guys remember what a cool friend Kenny was?  God.  He was always up for helpin' us out; man, he was the best friend ever.	[]
Butters	42	0	Look, fellas, I can't do it! My mom and dad call in every hour from work to make sure I am here. If I don't answer the ph-phone, it'll know I'm- I'm up to no good!	[]
Cartman	12	0	Alright alright, I'll stay here and answer the phone for you.	[]
Butters	8	0	No- but you don't sound like me.	[]
Cartman	25	1	Well, you don't sound like me. My name is Butters and I'm a little pussy who won't help his friends make money.	['pussy']
Kyle	5	0	Wow, that was pretty good.	[]
Stan	7	0	Alright, it's settled.Come on, Butters.	[]
Cartman	12	0	Don't forget, a third of that four million dollars is mine!	[]
Cartman	5	0	Eh.  Eh. Yeah.  Well hello?	[]

Kyle	57	2	Yeah, but you know, I've learned something today. It would have been wrong to exploit Butters' weight loss. Because then lots of fat people would have believed it.
