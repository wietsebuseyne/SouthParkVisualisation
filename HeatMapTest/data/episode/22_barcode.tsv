Other	15	0	Why do we hold the Sundance Film Festival here, Phyllis? It's so painfully crowded.	[]
Other	24	0	Because. People from L.A. love to come to a quaint little mountain town for a few days, and this gives them an excuse.	[]
Other	50	0	No, this used to be a quaint little mountain town. Now look at it. Sushi restaurants, upscale clothes stores, $25 parking, Liam Neeson... I tell you, Phyllis, I think we've tapped this town's resources out. We must move the festival to another small mountain town and begin again.	[]
Other	8	0	That's not a bad idea. But where?	[]
Other	4	0	Ching ching cha-ching.	[]
Other	1	0	Whoa.	[]
Mr. Garrison	19	0	Okay, children. I have some very exciting news for you... Oo-why don't you tell them, Mr. Twig?	[]
Other	14	0	That's right, Mr. Garrison. The First Annual South Park Film Festival begins today.	[]
Wendy	2	0	Wow! Cool!	[]
Kyle	13	1	They're not gonna show that stupid-ass Godzilla movie again, are they?	['ass']
Mr. Garrison	6	0	Nono, Kyle. These are independent films.	[]
Stan	8	1	Hoohh, like Independence Day? That sucked ass, too.	['ass']
Cartman	19	1	No, dude, independent films are those black and white hippie movies. They're always about gay cowboys eating pudding.	['gay']
Wendy	23	0	No they're not! Independent films are produced outside the Hollywood system. They're movies about all the glitz and glamour of Hollywood.	[]
Cartman	17	1	Byeh, sure. Well, you show me one independent film that  isn't about gay cowboys eating pudding!	['gay']
Wendy	12	0	Once again, you have no idea what you're talking about, fatass!	[]
Cartman	15	2	I'm not fat! I just haven't grown into my body yet, skinny bitch!	['fat', 'bitch']
Wendy	1	0	Hrmph!	[]
Mr. Garrison	19	1	Eric, if you call Wendy a bitch one more time, I'm sending you to the principal's office!	['bitch']
Cartman	1	1	...bitch.	['bitch']
Mr. Garrison	5	0	That's it Eric, you-!	[]
Cartman	3	0	I'm going!	[]
Mr. Garrison	44	1	Anyway, children, I want you all to see at least one independent film at the festival and then write a paper about it.  The first film showing is called Witness To Denial, and it's a sexual exploration piece about two women in love.	['sexual']
Stan	14	0	Oh, my uncle Jimbo has a ton of those movies in his dresser drawer.	[]
Other	13	0	Norma, I want to shoot the script next month with Demi Moore instead.	[]
Other	10	1	Well you can tell Spielberg he can kiss my ass!	['ass']
Other	28	0	Wow, look at this, Johnson. Traffic jams at every intersection, hoards of people pushing their way through the crowd. It's almost like we're a real city.	[]
Cartman	17	0	I can't believe I got sent to the principal's office because of your stupid girlfriend!	[]
Stan	5	0	She's not my girlfriend.	[]
Kenny	11	0	(Yeah, that's because you vomit on her all the time.)	[]
Kyle	2	0	Sick, Kenny.	[]
Stan	7	1	Damn, dude. Look at all these people.	['damn']
Other	13	0	I'm late for a screening, I'll call you from the theater.	[]
Kyle	8	0	All this for a bunch of stupid movies?	[]
Chef	3	0	Hello there, children!	[]
Other	2	0	Hey, Chef.	[]
Stan	2	0	Whatcha doin'?	[]
Chef	29	0	Children, this whole film festival thing has quite lucrative monetary possibilities. Now I'm gonna sell some of my famous cookies, to these Hollywood types, and make a mint!	[]
Cartman	4	0	What kind of cookies?	[]
Stan	3	0	Calm down, tubby.	[]
Chef	15	0	They're little cookies, with fudge in the middle. And I call them, Fudge 'Ems	[]
Cartman	4	0	I wanna Fudge 'Em.	[]
Chef	21	0	I can just see the commercial now. Wife got you down? Boss makin' you angry? Kids yellin' atcha? Well, Fudge 'Ems.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Cool!	[]
Chef	11	0	And I've also got my double chocolate cookies, Fudge This.	[]
Other	13	0	Oh look, one of the natives is selling local food wares. How quaint.	[]
Other	22	0	This is why I come to these things, to get away from L.A. and become one with the more simple culture.	[]
Chef	26	0	Well, perhaps you'd like to try my low-calorie cookies, Go Fudge Yourself, or my all-natural, I Don't Really Give A Flying Fudge.	[]
Other	9	0	Ooh, do you have any tofu or steamed celery?	[]
Chef	1	0	Huh?	[]
Other	9	0	I would kill for some cous cous right now.	[]
Chef	2	0	Whose goose?	[]
Other	14	0	Uuuuh, never mind. We brought some food from the Natural Market in L.A.	[]
Other	3	0	Cute sign, though.	[]
Wendy	19	0	Stan, I have two tickets for the opening film of the festival. Would you like to come with me?	[]
Cartman	20	0	Stan, nunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh hunh. Tunh tunh tunh tunh tinh teenh?	[]
Stan	18	0	Shut up, Cartman!  Sure, dude. I mean, since we have to write a paper on a film anyway.	[]
Cartman	18	0	She'll be the death of him, Kyle. Mark my words: she'll be the death of him.	[]
Kyle	13	0	If she holds his hand in that theater it'll be all over.	[]
Chef	17	0	Get 'em while they're hot! My all new cookies! I Just Went And Fudged Your Momma!	[]
Cartman	9	0	Jesus, he sure ran that one into the ground.	[]
Stan	12	0	When's this thing start? I hope there are some good previews.	[]
Wendy	11	0	Stan, film festival movies usually don't have previews before them.	[]
Stan	2	0	They what?!	[]
Other	32	0	Who are you to judge my womanly soul?  The Goddess flames that burn in my memory aren't dark. Dare you call them dark!  Here lies the Goddess truth of my body.	[]
Stan	2	0	Oh, brother.	[]
Other	34	0	The Goddess that cries, Freedom!  Here is the Goddess truth of my womanly being  You are my blossom, my flame. When we make love, it's like the sun is right outside the door.	[]
Other	7	0	Then make love to me, right now.	[]
Stan	1	0	Dude!	[]
Wendy	1	0	Sshh!	[]
Stan	1	0	Dude!	[]
Kyle	16	0	I can see clearly now, the rain is goneI can see all obstacles in my way-	[]
Other	10	0	Bubbeleh you need to get to bed! It's late!	[]
Kyle	4	0	I'm poopies, ma!	[]
Other	3	0	Well, hurry up!	[]
Kyle	8	0	Gone are the dark clouds that had me-	[]
Other	4	0	Ky-yle! Ky-yle!	[]
Kyle	3	0	Could it be?	[]
Other	2	1	Hooowwwdy ho!	['ho']
Kyle	8	0	Mr. Hankey? Mr. Hankey, is that you? Hello?	[]
Other	77	0	I'm here live in South Park, Colorado, where citizens from Los Angeles are arriving in droves for the town's first annual film festival. This is just a small quiet mountain community where nothing out of the ordinary ever really happens,  except for the occasional complete destruction of the entire town  and so the excitement level is naturally very high. Right now, the townspeople are anxiously awaiting the arrival of some of Hollywood's top celebrities.	[]
Kyle	11	0	It was him, dude. I told you, it was Mr. Hankey!	[]
Cartman	9	0	Wait, I thought Mr. Hankey only came at Christmastime.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Well, I'm sure it was him.	[]
Other	5	0	Look, look! Here comes somebody!	[]
Other	6	0	Move aside, I can't see.	[]
Other	7	0	Ladies and gentlemen, TV's Fred Savage.	[]
Other	1	0	AAWWWW!	[]
Other	11	0	Well, I'm sure a real person will show up soon.	[]
Kyle	8	0	So how was that movie last night, dude?	[]
Stan	8	0	Aw, dude, you don't even wanna know!	[]
Cartman	10	1	It had a bunch of gay cowboys eating pudding, huh?	['gay']
Stan	3	0	Yeah, pretty much.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Stan	11	0	The theater sucks, though. They need to get a bigger screen.	[]
Kyle	10	1	Maybe they should project the movies on Cartman's ass.	['ass']
Cartman	1	0	Ay!	[]
Stan	7	0	Dude, now that'd be like IMAX.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Okay, that's enough fatass jokes for this week.	[]
Kenny	23	2	(Cartman's ass is so fuckin' huge that they could probably show six stupid films on it and still have some room, heheheheheh)	['ass', 'fuckin']
Cartman	11	0	Okay, that does it. Screw you guys, I'm going home.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Well?	[]
Cartman	8	0	I'm gonna, just give me a minute.	[]
Other	26	0	This is perfect. Why didn't we think of it sooner? This town still has some charm left, not the mess we turned Park City into.	[]
Other	19	0	Forgive me for being observant, but, won't we just end up doing the same thing to this town?	[]
Other	41	0	Yes. And the town after, and the town after that. Like termites, we will move this film festival from town to town until we have used it up. And then move on, until every quiet mountain town is like Los Angeles.	[]
Other	8	0	Why? Why would we do such a thing?	[]
Other	44	0	Because we have to live in L.A. And if we can't live in quiet, simple, peaceful mountain towns, then nobody will!  Waitwaitwait. Zoom in to a close-up of my face when I do that. Ready? Then NOBODY will!  That's it.	[]
Chef	35	1	Children! I'm glad you're here! I want you to check out my new confectioneries. I think they're going to sell right through the roof! I call them, Chef's Salty Chocolate Balls.	['balls']
Stan	3	0	Are they good?	[]
Chef	2	0	Try 'em.	[]
Stan	5	0	Hey, dude, these are good!	[]
Cartman	8	1	Yeah, I love these Salty Chocolate Balls, Chef.	['balls']
Other	2	0	Ky-yle!	[]
Kyle	4	0	There it is again!	[]
Stan	4	0	There is what again?	[]
Other	2	0	Ky-yle!	[]
Kyle	13	0	It's Mr. Hankey! I think he's in some kind of trouble.	[]
Stan	13	1	Dude, how do you tell if a piece of poo is in trouble?	['poo']
Kyle	5	0	Where does that grill go?	[]
Stan	4	0	To the sewer, dude.	[]
Kyle	14	0	Of course, the sewer! That must be where he is. Come on!  Come on!	[]
Chef	54	3	Hey, everybody, have you seen my balls? They're big and salty and brown If you ever need a quick pick-me-up, just stick my balls in your mouth Ooooo, suck on my cho-colate salty balls put 'em in your mouth Put 'em in your mouth and suck 'em and suck 'em...	['balls', 'balls', 'balls']
Cartman	7	1	Aw, man, smells like ass down here.	['ass']
Kyle	11	2	Of course it smells like ass, retard. It's a sewer!	['ass', 'retard']
Stan	3	0	What was that?	[]
Cartman	8	0	Aw, man, let's get out of here!	[]
Kyle	10	0	We can't, dude. Not until we find Mr. Hankey.	[]
Other	1	0	Aaaaah!	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Wait!)	[]
Kyle	3	1	What the hell?	['hell']
Stan	2	0	Mr. Garrison?	[]
Mr. Garrison	4	0	Oh uh- hello, children.	[]
Cartman	15	0	What are you doing down in the sewer with a bunch of snorkel stuff on?	[]
Mr. Garrison	8	0	Oh I- I was just-uh hangin' out.	[]
Kyle	3	0	In a sewer?	[]
Mr. Garrison	10	0	Children, do you know how to file a police report?	[]
Other	1	0	No.	[]
Mr. Garrison	5	0	Good. See you in school.	[]
Cartman	10	1	This is ridiculous! What the hell are we, the Goonies?	['hell']
Kyle	17	1	Yeah, we're the Goonies, Cartman. Why don't you pretend like you're the fat kid?	['fat']
Cartman	10	0	Okay, that does it. Screw you guys, I'm home.	[]

Cartman	1	0	No.	[]
Kyle	9	0	What's the matter, Mr. Hankey? Are you sick?	[]
Other	21	0	Oh, I just got a little cold is all. All these new people in South Park are stressful on my home.	[]
Stan	4	0	What do you mean?	[]
Other	10	0	Well, you see, boys, the sewer is a fragile ecosystem.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Oh my God.	[]
Other	20	0	These new folks in town eat nothin' but cous cous, tofu, and raw vegetables, and it's destroying my environment.	[]
Kyle	8	0	And that's why you got a cold?	[]
Other	7	0	That's why, Kyle. That's why.	[]
Stan	10	0	Well, why don't you just ask them to leave?	[]
Other	28	0	There's only one time of year I can come to the surface, and that's Christmastime. That's why I need you boys to go for me.	[]
Kyle	13	0	Don't worry, Mr. Hankey. We'll go tell everyone. Come on, guys.	[]
Other	10	0	Don't forget to change your sheets once a week!	[]
Other	19	0	So without further ado we will begin this amazing film. It's a work of blood, sweat, and tears.	[]
Kyle	8	0	Wait! Stop! Could I have your attention, please?	[]
Other	4	0	Is that Leonardo DiCaprio?	[]
Kyle	1	0	Aaahh!	[]
Other	7	0	Ohuh no, wait, that's not him.	[]
Kyle	23	0	Ladies and gentlemen, my best friend, Mr. Hankey, is getting sick because South Park has become overcrowded with people who eat health food.	[]
Other	9	0	Excuse me, little boy, what's a Mr. Hankey?	[]
Kyle	70	2	He's a talking piece of poo that lives in the sewer. But now he's getting sick because his egosystem is all out of whack because of all the extra poo in the sewer. If you don't all leave and go home soon, Mr. Hankey's gonna die. He's one of my best friends in the whole wide worldeh, and I don't want him to die.	['poo', 'poo']
Other	7	0	What a great story-it has everything!	[]
Other	7	0	This could be the next Free Willy.	[]
Other	10	0	Great pic, son. How much do you want for it?	[]
Kyle	1	0	Huh??	[]
Other	11	1	Does it-uh have to be a talking piece of poo?	['poo']
Other	11	0	It could be a crime-fighting rabbit. Or a lovable turtle.	[]
Other	7	0	This could be a great summer movie.	[]
Other	8	0	Can we put a mon-key in it?	[]
Other	13	0	The Mr. Hankey Stor- uh is Harrison Ford available for a fall pic?	[]
Other	2	0	Keanu Reeves.	[]
Other	2	0	Matt Damon!	[]
Other	2	0	Fred Savage!	[]
Other	8	0	I'd pay a million for this story!	[]
Other	4	0	I'll pay two.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Dude, no one even listened to me.	[]
Stan	10	0	Well um, it does sound like a pretty sweet movie.	[]
Other	15	0	Mmuh I take it you're part owner of this whole Mr. Hooey story, right?	[]
Cartman	5	0	Huh? Uhuh, yeah, I guess.	[]
Other	11	0	I want you to do a big-money deal with me.	[]
Cartman	3	0	All of us?	[]
Other	24	1	Mm-we-hell, I can see that you're the real brains of the group. You don't really need those guys, do you?	['hell']
Cartman	11	0	Ye-ah, screw those guys. I don't even like them.	[]
Other	10	0	Hm-that's great, kid. Let's make a deal.	[]
Other	39	0	Ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you all for making the First Annual South Park Film Festival a success. We've barely even started and already the festival has seen more attendance than last year's Sundance festival.	[]
Other	1	0	Fantastic!	[]
Other	36	0	And I'm very pleased to announce that in honor of the South Park people who have welcomed us, we are going to build a Hollywood Planet restaurant, right here where this library used to stand.	[]
Other	1	0	Ooohhh!	[]
Other	4	0	Can they do that?	[]
Other	7	0	They're Hollywood! They can do anything!	[]
Kyle	6	0	Mr. Hankey!  Mr. Hankey?!  Mr. Hankey?	[]
Other	17	1	Oh, Kyle. Howdy-ho.  Well, how did it go? Is everyone gonna stop poopin' in my environment?	['ho']
Kyle	12	0	They didn't believe me. They thought I was pitching a movie.	[]
Other	15	0	Oh. I, I see. Welluh shucks, Kyle, I can't thank you enough for tryin'	[]
Kyle	13	0	We only have one option. I've gotta take you to the surface.	[]
Other	10	0	Aw I can't. The sun'll dry me out.	[]
Kyle	13	0	It's the only way to prove to them that you're real.	[]
Other	8	0	But I won't last long up above.	[]
Kyle	21	0	Well, you're not gonna last down here either, Mr. Hankey. Now, come on! I'm not gonna let you die!	[]
Other	8	0	All right, just let me get my toothbrush.	[]
Wendy	11	0	Come on, Stan, we're gonna be late for the screening!	[]
Stan	8	0	Jeez, they made that into a movie already?	[]
Other	13	0	Mr. Hankey, I can't go on anymore. I've lost the fight.	[]
Other	17	0	No, I'm not leaving without you.  We started this together, we're gonna finish it together.	[]
Other	15	0	I always thought death was something glorious, but now I know that it's not.	[]

Kyle	11	0	Mph. Okay, Mr. Hankey. We're out. How are you doin'?	[]
Other	6	0	It sure is -dry up here.	[]
Kyle	17	0	Don't worry. We'll do this quick, okay? Just hang on, Mr. Hankey, just hang on!	[]
Other	12	0	Excuse me, Mr. Film Commissioner, could I have a word with you?	[]
Other	3	0	Make it quick.	[]
Other	26	0	Well, the people of my town are a little upset. I don't think we realized what an impact this festival would have on our town.	[]
Other	2	0	Uh-huh.	[]
Other	14	0	Right. So, we were actually wondering if we could call this whole thing off?	[]
Other	29	0	We have contracts.  You try to pull out now, we'll sue your little town for every penny it's got. But thanks so much for the hard work.	[]
Cartman	22	0	Eh but, but this doesn't make sense to me, Marty! Okay, you told me the movie made a lot of money!	[]
Other	40	0	Mmp right. Two million, minus your agent's fee, minus your lawyer's fee, minus my fee, and the publicity and taxes taken out, you get three dollars! That's more than most people in your position make, trust me!	[]
Stan	8	0	Serves you right, Cartman! You're a sellout!	[]
Cartman	9	0	I'm not a sellout! What's a sellout?	[]
Stan	15	0	If you work in the entertainment business and you make money, you're a sellout!	[]
Chef	27	1	It's all gone to hell, children. And we're all to blame. Even me!  I was sellin' out my town, too! And now look at it.	['hell']

Kyle	9	0	Come on! Everything's gonna be okay!  Sir! Sir!	[]
Other	2	0	Not now!	[]

Other	3	0	What's this?	[]
Kyle	9	0	I want you guys to all meet my friend.	[]
Other	30	1	That's great, kid. A dried-out lump of shit; very compelling.  Okay, folks, let's move! We've gotta have that sign down in time for the opening tonight!	['shit']
Kyle	9	0	You can't die, Mr. Hankey. You can't.	[]

Kyle	2	0	Noo! No!	[]
Stan	11	0	Are you gonna be okay, dude? I'm here for you.	[]
Wendy	8	0	Hi, Stan. Ready to go see another movie?	[]
Stan	1	0	Okay!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Uuf.	[]
Other	8	0	Say, Tom. Do you have any pudding left?	[]
Other	6	0	I ate all mine up, silly.	[]
Other	7	0	Well then, now what do we do?	[]
Other	1	0	AAWWWW!	[]
Wendy	1	0	Eeewww!	[]
Other	1	0	Hey!	[]
Stan	1	0	Sorry.	[]
Other	9	1	Well, why don't we just explore our sexuality?	['sexuality']
Other	5	0	Ooh, good idea. Let's.	[]
Stan	9	0	Aw, dude, I shouldn't be seeing this!  Blaach!	[]
Other	7	0	Aaww!  Is there a problem, young man?	[]
Stan	3	0	No problem, dude.	[]
Kyle	12	0	I'll never forget you. You were my best friend after Stan.	[]
Chef	8	0	Come on, Kyle. It's time to go.	[]
Kyle	6	1	Chef, does poo go to heaven?	['poo']
Chef	33	2	Well, uh-I kinda hope not.  I mean, sure it does.  Here. I'll give him one of my Salty Balls to take with him to poo heaven.  Come on, let's go.	['balls', 'poo']
Other	1	0	Kyle.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Mr. Hankey?	[]
Other	2	1	Howdy-ho.	['ho']
Kyle	6	0	He's back! He's back!	[]
Other	3	0	That was delicious.	[]
Chef	9	1	My Salty Chocolate Balls must have re-juvenated him!	['balls']
Kyle	11	1	You've got the best balls in the whole world, Chef.	['balls']
Chef	4	0	You're daaamn right.	[]
Cartman	21	0	Step on up, get them here! Mr. Hankey & Me T-shirts! Get them while they last, folks. for only $14.95!	[]
Other	4	0	I'll take two.	[]
Other	7	0	I'd like to pay for one.	[]
Cartman	5	1	Selling T-shirts kicks ass!	['ass']
Other	50	0	Ladies and gentlemen, I'm pleased to announce on this Gala Opening of Hollywood Planet South Park, that the festival will be back next year!  And the year after that, and the year after that, and so on! And now, release the curtain!  I give you, Hollywood in South Park!	[]
Kyle	10	0	Wait!  I brought him! I brought him to show you!	[]
Other	4	0	Oh, not this again!	[]
Kyle	3	0	Behold! Mr. Hankey!	[]
Other	2	1	Hoooooowwwdy-ho!	['ho']
Other	13	0	Anyway, this new Hollywood Planet will be the official meeting place for all-	[]
Other	23	1	Howdy-ho, folks. I'm afraid my buddy Kyle was right. There's not enough room in South Park to accommodate a festival.	['ho']
Other	34	1	Mr. Poo, if you wouldn't mind, we can't hear our chairman. If you could just turn yourself down. You're at about 7 right now, we need you at about, 3, okay?	['poo']
Other	117	0	Uh, folks, please. Little towns like this simply aren't made for friggin' films. We love havin' visitors, but golly, too many of you is hurtin' our ecosystem. Be-sides, folks, film festivals shouldn't be about what celebrities are comin' or what film is gonna get sold. It should be about people gettin' together, and watchin' movies, and about people who could never get their movies seen havin' a chance to have it watched, if only once. A good film festival should be something where we all say, Gaw, let's forget about lawyers and managers and studios and celebrities. Let's forget all those things for just a while, and just watch some new art.	[]
Other	6	0	I have had enough of you!	[]
Other	1	0	Nyyaarrrr!	[]
Kyle	1	0	No!	[]
Other	16	0	Now, as I was saying, this shall usher in a whole new decade of film festivals.	[]
