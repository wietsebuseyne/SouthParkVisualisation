Other	9	0	Why, hello Chef. Let me guess, pink eye, right?	[]
Chef	22	0	No, no doctor, I've seen this type of thing before. This ain't no pink eye, it's the living dead.	[]
Other	7	1	What the hell are you talking about?	['hell']
Chef	23	0	Think about it: Dead people getting up and walking around, and Tina Yothers comin' to town? Coincidence?? Oooh I don't think so!	[]
