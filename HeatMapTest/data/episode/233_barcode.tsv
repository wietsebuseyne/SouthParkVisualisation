Other	84	1	Erectile dysfunction is a fact of life. You want to show her you love her, but you're old, and so is she.  The next time that special moment comes, don't let your sex drive fail you just because your wife looks like a shriveled prune. Fake it, with Cialis.  It won't make her any harder, but it will make you not care for up to three hours.  And then you can still have your own separate bathrub from her later on.	['sex']
Other	8	0	Hey Sheila. You feel like having some fun?	[]
Other	10	0	Oh dear, did the Cialis commercial turn you on again?	[]
Other	7	0	How about I put on the uniform?	[]
Other	2	0	Oh, Gerald...	[]
Other	10	0	Huh? What do you think? You know you like it.	[]
Other	2	0	Oh, hello.	[]
Other	10	0	UPS man. I have a ...package from Amazon for you.	[]
Other	7	0	Oh, dear, but I'm barely dressed.	[]
Other	7	0	If you'll just...  sign right here.	[]
Other	10	0	Oh, you're so rough with me, Mr. UPS man!	[]
Other	8	0	Yeah?  Do you like your package, ma'am?	[]
Other	2	0	Oh yes!	[]
Other	1	0	Huh?	[]
Other	5	0	Do it harder, UPS man!	[]
Kyle	28	0	Ike, what's the matter?  Dude, you've been in here crying all morning. What's going on?  Oh. My. God. Ike, a-are you sure about this?	[]
Ike	2	0	Yes! Yes!	[]
Kyle	13	0	I-Ike, this is a big deal. You have to be absolutely, 100%-	[]
Ike	7	0	I saw them, Kyle, I saw them!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Oh no...	[]
Kyle	16	0	You guys can't tell anybody, all right? Not until I figure out what to do.	[]
Stan	3	0	Dude, what happened?	[]
Kyle	3	0	Take a look.	[]
Stan	3	0	What's this?	[]
Kyle	14	1	Ike found out last night. My mom's having sex with the UPS man.	['sex']
Stan	1	0	Whoa!	[]
Cartman	3	0	Dude, no way!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Yeah dude.	[]
Stan	15	4	But are you sure they had sex, like, sex sex, or they actually had sex?	['sex', 'sex', 'sex', 'sex']
Kyle	50	1	Yeah dude, like, full-on. Ike saw everything. It totally makes sense now. My mom's been ordering all kinds of stuff from Amazon lately. Sometimes, sh-she doesn't even remember what she's ordered. She's probably been having sex with the UPS man for a long time.	['sex']
Randy	1	0	Ohhhh...	[]
Stan	7	0	Well are you gonna tell your dad?	[]
Kyle	18	0	I don't know. I feel like I should confront my mom first. But it's so embarrassing.	[]
Cartman	13	1	Kyle, have you stopped to think that maybe the sex wasn't consensual?	['sex']
Kyle	1	0	What?	[]
Cartman	44	2	Isn't it possible your mom was raped by the UPS man? We know nothing about this guy and he shows up to all of our houses. Think about it: what kind of sane, normal person would wanna have sex with Kyle's mom?	['raped', 'sex']
Stan	4	0	Cartman dude, not now.	[]
Cartman	44	2	No, hear me out, you guys. Haven't you seen those ADT commercials? Women these days get raped by perfectly normal-looking white guys in broad daylight. It may be too late for Kyle's mom, but I'm getting some God damned security!	['raped', 'damned']
Randy	17	0	Look, look, the thing is, do we tell Gerald, or do we just stay out of it?	[]
Other	23	0	How do you tell him? Hey Gerald, Sorry, but the UPS man is bangin' your wife. It's really none of our business.	[]
Other	18	1	If my wife was having sex with the UPS man, I'd want you guys to tell me!	['sex']
Other	50	2	How do you know she's not? I mean, think about it: this is a guy who visits all our houses during the day, who clearly has a kind of... insatiable lust... I mean, somebody who would have sex with Kyle's mom would have sex with just about anything!	['sex', 'sex']
Randy	13	0	Oh, come on, he can't be trying that with all our wives?	[]
Other	104	1	Wouldn't be the first time.  Hyeah, there's a price to be paid with having things convenient. Used to be... a man had to go to the store to buy himself a pitcher of milk. Hyeah, but men got lazy. They wanted that milk delivered right to the door. Only problem was, the guy deliverin' that milk end sup fuckin' your wife. Sure, you had your nice cold milk delivered right to your doorstep, but your wife was gettin' pounded out like a mallard duck.  And now you got your Amazon.  And the milkman's come back.  And none of ya are safe.	['fuckin']
Other	40	0	And so you'd need the motion detectors in the living room and the kitchen, the touch pads at the front and rear doors, and break-in monitors on all windows. I'm afraid those are not secure at all.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Oh no, really?	[]
Other	14	0	Oh, I'm sorry, but I really don't think I can afford this.	[]
Cartman	23	2	Mom, do you wanna get raped?! Haven't you seen their commercials?! You can get raped by a white guy these days, Mom!	['raped', 'raped']
Other	1	0	Ohhh...	[]
Other	14	0	Yes, unfortunately it's not enough to just be fearful of strangers these days.	[]
Cartman	5	0	What-what do you mean?	[]
Other	11	0	Well, many times, houses are burglarized by someone the victim knows.	[]
Cartman	25	1	Oh my God, I knew it! Kyle is always taking my stuff! Just yesterday I couldn't find my iPod headphones! That sneaky little Jew!	['jew']
Other	22	0	We realize that's a lot of money, Mrs. Cartman, but really, how much is feeling secure in your own home worth?	[]
Cartman	11	0	Yeah Mom! There's dangerous people trying to screw us both!	[]
Other	10	0	Don't you need to be getting to work, Rand?	[]
Randy	16	0	No, I think I'll uh, ...just hang out a little longer.  I'll get it.	[]
Other	14	0	Hey there, looks like I got a couple of packagers from Amazon for ya.	[]
Randy	4	0	Oh, is that so?	[]
Other	9	0	If I can just get your signature right  there?	[]
Randy	5	0	Sure um... Chad, is it?	[]
Other	1	0	Thad.	[]
Randy	8	0	Thad. Nice. You um, havin' a busy day?	[]
Other	9	0	Oh you know, just, tryin' to get to everyone.	[]
Randy	4	0	Yeah I'll bet.	[]
Other	5	0	Well, have a good one.	[]
Randy	10	0	Yeah, you too, Thad.  Hey Sharon, these came for you.	[]
Other	4	0	Ooooo, stuff from Amazon?	[]
Randy	5	0	Yeah, w-what are they?	[]
Other	9	0	You know, to be honest, I can't remember?	[]
Randy	13	0	You just... order stuff off of Amazon and you can't remember what?	[]
Other	34	0	Ohhh yeahyeahyeah, these are the paring knives I ordered. Sorry, I think I was a little tipsy.  oh, and this is the book Stan's been wanting; can you take it up to him?	[]
Randy	14	0	Yeah, sure, 'cause...  people just order stuff from Amazon and... forget what they got.	[]
Randy	9	1	Stan, you got something from Amazon.  Oh.  Ooohhh shit.	['shit']
Cartman	10	2	Oh fuck.  Oh what's the- God damn it!  Hello?	['fuck', 'damn']
Other	11	0	This is Jeff with Wolf Home Security. Is everything all right?	[]
Cartman	19	0	Uh yeah, sorry, I live here, I just, I can't remember the code to turn off the alarm!	[]
Other	14	0	That's okay. Do you have your security pass phrase you can tell me?	[]
Cartman	23	2	Oh yeah yeah, my pass phrase is... Kyle is a dirty no-good Jew.  No wait, Kyle is a no-good lying Jew.	['jew', 'jew']
Other	9	0	Okay, I've got something a little different here.	[]
Cartman	21	0	Uhhh, it is My friend Kyle is a no-good dirty...? Hang on, I've got it written down here somewhere.	[]
Other	2	0	No problem.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Sorry about this.	[]
Other	9	0	It's all right, it happens all the time.	[]
Cartman	26	1	'Kay, thanks, I... Wait! Hang on a second! What do you mean That's all right! What if I was somebody trying to rape my mom?!	['rape']
Other	6	1	You want to rape your mom?	['rape']
Cartman	37	1	That's nice, you're so cool about me triggering the alarm and not knowing the password, but how do you know I'm not making it up?! I could have raped my mom twice by now!	['raped']
Other	5	0	You said you lived there.	[]
Cartman	19	1	I do, but you don't know that! I could be Kyle trying to take more of my shit!	['shit']
Randy	15	0	How did you get rid of him?  How did you get rid of the milkman?	[]
Other	34	1	There's no getting rid of him. Not in any you folks would be prepared for. Noh, best you just let him go on fucking your wives. Maybe he'll get tired of it.	['fucking']
Other	75	2	Damn you, it's not just our wives anymore!  This morning, he came for me. I opened the door. It was the UPS man. He had a box from Amazon. I looked inside and found an adapter for an iPhone and then I remembered: I had ordered it! I ordered it the day before and I had barely any recollection. The UPS man is using his powers to try to have sex with me now.	['damn', 'sex']
Randy	15	0	You said we wouldn't be prepared to get rid of him. How did you?	[]
Other	109	1	We used a pretty blonde to lure him in. When she answered the door she told the milkman to follow her to the bathrub. She took off her clothes and... asked the milkman to fill the tub with milk. The milkman said, You want that milk pasteurize? And the blonde replied, No, just up to my boobs. I can splash it in my eyes. That's when we jumped 'im. It was over in minutes. Then we burned his body. You wanna get rid of the milkman? You gotta kill him and kill him good. And then you gotta go to the store for your stuff from then on.	['boobs']
Other	15	0	Hey, ey uh,  you want me to do this, you gotta pay up front, kid!	[]
Cartman	48	1	You'll get your money when you finish doing what I asked you, all right? Now as soon as I lock the door, just give me a few seconds to arm the system, then you break in and try to rape my mom. Okay? You got it?  Hello?	['rape']
Other	11	0	This is Michael with Wolf Home Security. Is everything all right?	[]
Cartman	34	1	Uh, no, a man just broke into our house and he's about to rape my mom.  Go go, she's upstairs.  Hello, did you hear me? A rapist is here; he's white!	['rape']
Other	7	0	Oh-kay, should we contact the police?	[]
Cartman	15	3	Yes you should contact the fucking police! My mom is about to get fucking raped!	['fucking', 'fucking', 'raped']
Other	6	0	Okay, we're contacting them now.	[]
Cartman	11	0	He's goin' up the stairs, dude, you'd better hurry!	[]
Other	10	0	Try and stay calm, the police are on their way.	[]
Cartman	23	1	Well that's nice, maybe they could bring some cigarettes and Gatorade, 'cause the guy's gonna be pretty wiped out!  The fuck?!	['fuck']
Other	9	0	Hey there, misterrr Stotch. looks like another Amazon package.	[]

Other	1	0	Aaawwgh!	[]
Other	8	0	You should have never come to our town!	[]
Other	10	0	A man's wife is his life, Mr. UPS man.	[]
Other	3	0	Oh my God.	[]
Other	3	0	Come on honey!	[]

Cartman	8	1	Oh, that is bullshit! Put your manager on!	['bullshit']
Other	3	0	Okay, hold on.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Heh- hello?	[]
Other	11	0	This is Kevin with Wolf Home Security. Is everything all right?	[]
Cartman	22	0	No, everything's not all right. How come a guy from India is calling me when my house is being broken into?!	[]
Other	20	0	We have alarms going off across the country fourteen times a minute. That takes a lot of employees manning phones.	[]
Cartman	23	0	Dude, I'm not paying all this money to have some guy on the other side of the Earth try and protect me!	[]
Other	18	0	Sir, it doesn't matter where we call you from, we still contact the police in your neighborhood.	[]
Cartman	64	2	Oh really? Oh okay. Gosh I'm so relieved! Thanks. There's still just one little problem: How do you know I didn't break into this house, set off the alarm, and now I'm stalling by being upset about the Indian guy and have actually stolen a bunch of shit, raped my mom, and you people have done absolutely nothing about it?!	['shit', 'raped']
Other	11	1	I d-I d'uh... Wow, that just fucked my head.	['fucked']
Cartman	14	2	Yeah I just fucked your head and the UPS guy just fucked my mom!	['fucked', 'fucked']
Other	31	0	All right, quiet down people, please! Quiet!  I know you're all worried about your families' security. All I can tell you is that so far, Bane has not been caught.	[]
Mr. Mackey	37	0	Uh, what are we supposed to do? I mean if Bane is out there on the loose then none of us are safe. One Bane's bad enough, but apparently we got like, like seven Banes? Uhkay?	[]
Other	15	0	And what do we tell our kids?! We can't leave them in the dark!	[]
Randy	13	0	Wouldn't be the only ones in your family completely in the dark.	[]
Other	1	0	What?	[]
Randy	2	0	Huh? Nothing.	[]
Other	22	0	Now listen! There's nothing more we can do to protect your homes. But there's someone here who says he can.	[]
Other	56	0	Hello folks, we're more than happy to get your homes safe and secure. Now, you're gonna be wanting monitors on all your doors and windows, motion detectors in the living areas, and I would also recommend you all get our newest personal security system to make sure your wives are safe outside the home.	[]
Randy	7	0	Whoawhoa, wait, wait. What do you mean?	[]
Other	54	0	Protecting your home and your family is hard enough! But sometimes alarms on your doors and windows aren't enough! A new security system allows not only for your doors and windows to be monitored, but your fear levels as well.  A security system that is actually inside you. It's called IN-security.	[]
Other	14	0	We'll never forget the day we took our twin daughters to the beach.	[]
Other	4	0	Hehey, what cute twins.	[]
Other	1	0	Thanks.	[]
Other	13	1	They're so adorable  that I'm gonna bash their fucking heads in!	['fucking']
Other	9	0	This is Peter with INsecurity. Is everything all right?	[]
Other	10	0	A white man just tried to murder our twin girls.	[]
Other	12	0	I have a police car on their way with blankets and cocoa.	[]
Other	12	0	I only hope other have people have INsecurity to protect their families.	[]
Other	7	0	Well, how's the shoe fit, pal?	[]
Other	6	0	I think it fits pretty good.	[]
Other	17	2	Well okayhehe, let's see if it fits better than this KNIFE THROUGH YOUR FUCKING SKULL, BASTARD?!	['fucking', 'bastard']
Other	1	0	Aaahh!	[]
Other	1	0	Hello?	[]
Other	9	0	This is David with INsecurity. Is everything all right?	[]
Other	10	0	No, a while shoe salesman tried to murder my son.	[]
Other	11	0	Hold tight. Police are on their way with blankets and cocoa.	[]
Other	14	0	Don't let your family become another statistic. Have piece of mind with...  INsecurity.	[]
Kyle	19	0	It just keeps getting worse. I see stuff from Amazon almost every day. My poor dad has no idea.	[]
Stan	8	0	You're gonna have to tell him, dude.	[]
Kyle	2	0	I know...	[]
Cartman	13	0	HaHA Kyle! Let's see you try and take my iPod headphones HOW!	[]
Kyle	1	0	What?!	[]
Cartman	17	0	Just wanted you to know that if you wanna steal somebody's stuff, you should look elsewhere.	[]
Kyle	9	2	Nobody wants any of your stuff, you fat bitch!	['fat', 'bitch']
Cartman	35	5	Oh, fat bitch, huh?!  Well it just so happens that this fat bitch has INsecurity now, Kyle, and so I'm protected from ALL you greedy little Jews until you and your people DIE OUT!	['fat', 'bitch', 'fat', 'bitch', 'jews']
Kyle	11	1	The Jewish population isn't dying out, fatass! It's growing!	['jewish']
Cartman	2	0	What?  Hello?	[]
Other	9	0	This is Marcus with INsecurity. Is everything all right?	[]
Cartman	18	0	Yeah yeah no, false alarm. I, I just heard some troubling news and it set off my INsecurity.	[]
Other	9	0	All right, could I just get your password please?	[]

Cartman	7	2	No, uloveboobs. Lower-case u love boobs.	['uloveboobs', 'boobs']
Other	5	0	How did you know that?	[]
Cartman	4	1	My password is uloveboobs!	['uloveboobs']
Other	9	0	Oh oh I get it. That's pretty funny.	[]
Cartman	13	1	You, it's fucking hilarious! Now can you shut off my INsecurity please?!	['fucking']
Other	4	0	Sure, here you go.	[]
Cartman	13	1	Okay. So anyway, Kyle, you'd better watch ih-!  Kyle? God damn it.	['damn']
Randy	25	0	And then I had to drive to Walgreens, Barnes & Noble AND Ace Hardware. I tell you, having to go around and buy stuff again sucks.	[]
Other	14	0	Yeah, but at least we never have to deal with that UPS driver again.	[]
Other	3	0	He's back!	[]
Other	1	0	What?!	[]
Other	29	0	I just came from Will Patterson's house! His mother got three packages from Amazon! And the UPS guy told her what he'd like to do to her!	[]
Other	1	0	How?	[]
Other	8	0	He casually dropped this on his way out!	[]
Randy	3	0	Oh my God!	[]
Other	16	0	Didn't kill 'im, did ya?  Yea', I didn't think you had it in ya.	[]
Randy	9	0	We scared him! We thought that'd be enough!	[]
Other	12	1	Milkman don't get scared. Not with free pussy at every doorstep.	['pussy']
Other	9	1	Son of a bitch, it's him all right!	['bitch']
Randy	8	0	This guy doesn't know when to quit!	[]
Other	6	0	He's stopping at another house.	[]
Other	19	0	Guess this guy's a lot tougher than we thought. Must be why our wives want him so bad.	[]
Randy	6	0	Sorry sorry, that's me.  Hello?	[]
Other	9	0	This is Alvin with INsecurity. Is everything all right?	[]
Randy	14	1	Yeah, sorry, false alarm. Pass phrase is tickle me homo.  It's a joke.	['homo']
Kyle	17	1	Mom, Dad, you've always taught me that being direct and honest is a basic Jewish tenet.	['jewish']
Other	4	0	That's right, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	30	0	And that applies to all of us, doesn't it? Even though it's convenient to have things done for you, sometimes it's best to deal with it yourself.	[]
Other	8	0	Uhh, hi, I got a delivery for ya?	[]
Kyle	8	0	Yeah. Come in for a minute, would you?	[]
Other	1	0	What?	[]
Kyle	25	0	Please? I need you to come sit down for a second.  So... Here we all are. Mom, do you want to tell Dad something?  Mom?	[]
Other	4	0	What's going on?	[]
Kyle	24	1	You know God damned well what's going on! This ends right now! We are a family, and you need to go somewhere else!	['damned']
Other	34	1	Don't you think I want to?!  I hate this damned town! Every day, things just keep getting weirder around here, and I'm just about sick of it! Aaah!  Oh my God!  Hello?	['damned']
Other	9	0	This is Brian with INsecurity, is everything all right?	[]
Other	11	0	No! They blew up my car! They blew up my car!	[]
Other	13	0	I'm sending help. Police are on their way with blankets and cocoa.	[]
Other	7	0	They're after me again! Do something!	[]
Other	21	1	Ho- hold on one second, sir, I have another emergency coming in.  This is Brian with INsecurity, is everything all right?	['ho']
Cartman	21	2	Yeah, no, false alarm again. I'm in the store and some fat bitch asked me if my dad likes cologne.	['fat', 'bitch']
Other	8	1	What the hell's goin' on out here?!	['hell']
Other	14	0	Stay out of this, Gerald! Some men care about what their wives are doing!	[]
Other	9	0	What?! You don't even have a wife, Jimbo!	[]
Other	9	0	Somebody answer me! You have to send help now!	[]
Other	16	0	Sir, we are sending help. Just stay calm.  Hang on sir, this is Martin with INsecurity.	[]
Randy	13	0	Yeah, I'm thinking maybe Gerald's house is nicer than mine is.	[]
Other	6	0	Hello, this is Martin with INsecu-	[]
Cartman	35	3	God damn it I've had it with you people! When I signed up, I thought I was getting CSI guys protecting my ass, but all of you answering the phones are complete retards! Hello?	['damn', 'ass', 'retards']

Other	4	0	Yes, that's mine.	[]
Randy	2	0	Yours? What?	[]
Other	12	0	Give me that! What we do in our bedroom is our business!	[]
Kyle	8	0	Wait a minute, Dad was the UPS man?	[]
Other	38	1	Uhh, Kyle, uh sometimes when people get older they need to play and pretend to keep things interesting. Iiit's just a way I can still be intimate with your mother without relying on silly sexual enhancement drugs.	['sexual']
Other	1	0	Hello?	[]
Randy	32	0	It's over. But you were wrong. We don't have to be afraid of Amazon. The only price to be paid for convenience is that we must be secure with ourselves.	[]
Other	41	1	Yea'. Got yourselves some nice home security systems, don'tcha? Payin' a man to do your job of protecting your house. Only problem is, while you're out feelin' like your things are safe, that security man is fucking your wife.	['fucking']
Other	26	0	Doors and windows should be armed and your motion detectors are up and running, just call me whenever you need me back.  Ah! Who are you??	[]
Cartman	18	0	It doesn't matter who we are, what matters is our plan. You should have respected my authoritay.	[]
Other	1	0	Hoo!	[]
