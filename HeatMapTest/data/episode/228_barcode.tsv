Cartman	81	4	Nonono, I'm tellin' you guys, music videos have devolved to nothing but pretty girls wearing skin-tight clothes, and singin' songs about their vajayjays. Used to be chicks sang about their relationships; now it's all my vajayjay this, my vajayjay that. But clearly that's what sells. Think about it. When was the last time you turned on a music video and didn't see some chick strumming a guitar singing about her vajayjay?  See? You can't remember.	['vajayjays', 'vajayjay', 'vajayjay', 'vajayjay']

Other	48	0	Mr. Mackey, what is happening here at your school is no different from what is happening all over the country. Bullying has become an epidemic, I'm afraid, and we at Bully Buckers TRADEMARK are trying to stamp it out. What is your school's policy on bullying?	[]

Other	4	0	This way, ma'am	[]
Other	4	0	Oops, I'm coming.	[]
Other	55	0	What makes a bully?  The truth is there are more bullies at your school than you even think. And the student who lets bullying happen is just as bad as the bully himself. Come on out, Lorraine.  I asked your school mate Lorraine here to help me out.  Are you bullied in the school, Lorraine?	[]

Other	14	1	Do they say Nice pants. Why do you wear them up to your tits??	['tits']
Other	1	0	No...	[]
Other	92	0	Bullying affects everyone. And only if the entire school is united against it can bullying ever be stopped.  Go, go, get out of here.  Now what we at Bucky Bailey's Bully Busters TM like to do is get the schools to make an anti-bullying video. So who would like to be the young student director in charge of our video?  We just need one student to be the leader of our anti-bullying campaign.  What? Are you all chicken?  Nobody wants to be in charge of the anti-bullying video?	[]
Stan	9	0	I'll do it! I'll be in charge.	[]
Other	15	0	Ooooo, you're a big man?! You wanna show what a big man you are?!	[]

Let's all put an end to bullying. Right now! Five Six Seven Eight!	[]
Other	75	0	Bullying isn't cool. Bullying is lame. Bullying is ugly and has a stupid name. For a healthy world, bullying's unfit. And I think I know what we should do to i-it. Do do do do do to i-it. Let's all get together and make bullying kill itself. Bullying's an ugly thing Lets shove its face in the dirt and make bullying kill itself. Woah-oh. Woah-oh. Woah-oh.	[]
Cartman	20	1	Boy you like my body. Set the mood, let's play! You can touch me anywhere except for my vajayjay.	['vajayjay']
Other	84	2	We can make it stop. We can stomp it out. We can beat its ass until it starts to cry. Let's gang up on it and tell it it smells And beat its ass worse if it ever te-lls. If if if it ever te-lls. Lets all join together to try to make bullying kill itself. It'll be fun to see just how bad we can make it feel and make bullying kill itself. Woah-oh. Woah-oh. Woah-oh.

Other	56	2	Yeah, only problem is America doesn't give a SHIT about an old fart with a Captain Kangaroo haircut! They wanna believe kids did something on their own.  Here's a cease and desist letter from our lawyers. If you ever claim any authorship of the video again, we will sue you for everything you have!	['shit', 'fart']

Stan	2	0	Oh yeah.	[]
Kyle	20	0	Look, this is all getting way too big! Tell the movie studio you aren't selling the video to them.	[]
Stan	17	0	This video can change how people think about bullying! It needs to be seen by everybody, Kyle!	[]
Kyle	22	0	If it needs to be seen by everybody, then why don't you put it out on the Internet for free?!  Well?!	[]
Stan	6	0	...What, what was the question again?	[]
Kyle	26	0	If you really think every kid in America should see your anti-bullying movie, then why don't you put it on the Internet for free?!	[]

Kyle	18	0	Fine! But when you're naked and jackin' it in San Diego, don't ask me for help!	[]
Stan	6	0	Why does he keep saying that?	[]
Other	69	1	We all know that bullying has become an epidemic. Like AIDS, bullying is escalating and is spread mostly by penises. But now a few school kids are trying to make a difference with a video to make bullying kill itself.  I'm joined by the film's director as well as the weak little boy who's the main subject of the film. Stan, congratulations on all your success.	['penises']

Jesus	8	0	Oh, what are you gonna do? Kwy now?	[]
Butters	196	1	Grandma? I did it, Grandma.  I finally stood up for myself. I got real mean and I beat the shnozz our of Dr. Oz.  I can't lie, it felt kind of good.  At first. But since then all I have is just... a kind of dark, empty feeling. Then I realized... that's how you must feel. All the time.  Poor old Grandma. You know, I've I've been gettin' lots of advice how to deal with you. Stand up to you, tell on you... But I kind of realize there's just people like you out there. All over the place. When you're a kid, things seem like they're gonna last forever. But they're not. Life changes. Why you won't always be around. Someday you're gonna die.  Someday pretty soon.  And when you're layin' in that hospital bed, with tubes up your nose, and that little pan under your butt to pee in, well I'll come visit ya. I'll come just to show you that, that I'm still alive and I'm still happy. And you'll die. Bein' nothin' but you.  'Night Grandma.	['butt']
