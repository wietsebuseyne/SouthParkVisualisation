Butters	8	0	Well it's on, it's on, itsonitsonitson!	[]
Other	11	0	You are watching the Canada Channel, the only channel in Canada.	[]
Other	15	1	Previously on Terrance & Phillip: Terrance farted on the American president, but Phillip took the heat.	['farted']

Other	2	0	Alright Doctor.	[]
Other	4	0	I'm ready, Doctor.	[]
Other	10	0	Now I'm just going to check for cysts.  Awww!	[]
Cartman	5	1	What the fuck is this?!	['fuck']
Other	16	1	Now listen heauh! If you queef in my face, then I refuse to be your gynecologist!	['queef']
Other	11	1	I'm sorry, doctor. I had air trapped in my vagina.	['vagina']
Other	1	0	Huhuhuhu!	[]
Other	36	0	Well just don't let it happen again! Now I'm going to check for cysts.  Arh!  Now stop it! That isn't funny! Babies come from there!  That's it! No PAP smear for you!	[]
Other	7	0	But doctor, what if I have cancer?	[]
Other	14	1	You should have thought of that before you queefed in my face three times!	['queefed']
Butters	15	0	They, uh they aren't gonna show part 2 of the Terrance and Phillip show?	[]
Other	15	0	Doctor, my sister is just being difficult. Maybe you can just examine my cervix instead.	[]
Other	20	2	Well alright, let me check for cysts.  Nooo!  That does it, Queef Sisters! I'm not your vaginal doctor anymore!	['queef', 'vaginal']
Other	10	0	Oh Katie, I do believe we made the doctor angry.	[]
Other	4	0	I guess so Katherine.	[]
Cartman	8	2	Dude! What the hell is this disgusting crap?!	['hell', 'crap']
Other	7	2	What the hell is this disgusting crap?!	['hell', 'crap']
Other	2	1	Queef Sisters?!	['queef']
Other	14	0	That's right. It's a hot new Canadian show we're trying out.	[]
Other	19	1	You replaced our show with this?! But they aren't funny! All they do is queef all the time!	['queef']
Other	3	0	That's sick!	[]
Other	8	2	You think farts are funny; why not queefs?	['farts', 'queefs']
Other	5	0	Because babies come from there!	[]
Other	46	1	Eh, look guys, women are starting to be the driving force behind the television audience! You know, women empowerment and the get-go. So we want to try to appeal to the female sensibility. Sorry guys, but if you ask me, your farts have gotten stale!	['farts']
Cartman	47	2	No! No! As a matter of fact, I will not hold! I've been on hold for thirty-five minutes! Well we want some Goddamned answers, that's what we want! Like why did you show that smut instead of the Terrance and Phillip conclusion, you asshole?!	['goddamned', 'asshole']
Wendy	4	0	What's going on?	[]
Stan	15	0	We're complaining to the Canada Network 'cause they put something really gross on TV!	[]

Butters	17	1	They didn't show part 2 of Terrance and Phillip!  They replaced it with the Queef Sisters!	['queef']
Kyle	11	1	It was just thirty minutes of two women queefing on people!	['queefing']
Bebe	10	2	Oh what? So farts are hysterical but queefs are gross?	['farts', 'queefs']
Cartman	30	0	You know that little kids could have been watching that?! What kind of network are you running there in Canada?! Don't call me buddy! I'm not your buddy!	[]
Bebe	8	0	I can't believe they're this upset.	[]
Other	4	0	God, they're annoying!	[]
Other	9	1	I don't even know what a queef is.	['queef']
Wendy	11	0	It's when a woman blows air out her vag, Annie.	[]
Other	1	0	Oh.	[]
Other	14	1	You know that girl Samantha Dunskin, she can make herself queef whenever she wants.	['queef']
Bebe	1	0	Really?	[]
Wendy	8	0	Wait a minute. I've got an idea.	[]
Cartman	15	0	And to that end, by resorting to filth and garbage, the Canada Channel has thusly...	[]
Kyle	5	0	Robbed us of our innocence.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Yes, that's good.	[]
Butters	5	0	Robbed us of our innocence...	[]
Wendy	9	0	Hey guys, we have a little surprise for you.	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Butters	6	0	Oh God, oh my God no!	[]
Other	1	0	Butters?	[]
Randy	53	0	Oh my God, well how is he doing? Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure. Huh okay, well thank you for telling me, Mr. Stotch, I'll spread the word. Yoeah, you take care. Bye.  We need to cancel our plans, Sharon. There's gonna be an emergency all-parent meeting at the school tonight.	[]
Other	3	0	Why? What happened?	[]
Randy	13	1	A girl at school, she... queefed on one of Stan's friends today.	['queefed']
Other	1	0	...So?	[]
Randy	15	0	Hey pal. I heard about what happened at school today. You wanna talk about it?	[]
Stan	15	0	Butters was just sitting there, Dad. He... he didn't even know it was coming.	[]
Randy	27	0	I know, pal. Sometimes... bad things happen to good people. But you know Butters is still Butters, and he needs you guys right now more than anybody.	[]
Stan	14	0	It was so gross, Dad, I mean, what if another girl at school tries-?	[]
Randy	24	0	Hey, we're getting all the parents together and we're gonna take care of this, okay? Nothing like this will ever happen again.	[]
Mr. Mackey	49	1	M'kay, parents, some of you have already heard, but most of you have not, m'kay? We've had a terrible incident occur at the school. Apparently a young girl uh, went up to a young boy here at the school, m'kay, and queefed in his face.	['queefed']
Other	4	0	How did this happen?	[]
Other	4	0	Where were the teachers?!	[]
Other	21	1	Whoa, whoa whoa, wait a minute. Are you saying we're all here just because a girl queefed on a boy?	['queefed']
Other	1	0	Just?!	[]
Other	7	0	We're here to find out why?!	[]
Randy	21	0	The question is, how do we send a message to other girls in the school so this doesn't happen again!	[]
Other	32	1	Now hold on a minute, I think we're being a little drastic here. You know, I probably see a boy in my office once a week for farting on a girl.	['farting']
Randy	8	0	What does that have to do with anything?	[]
Other	27	1	Our next guests have really taken America by storm. Their hit show is being tuned in by women all over the world. Please welcome the Queef Sisters!	['queef']
Other	3	0	Oh hello Regis.	[]
Other	2	0	Hello Kelly.	[]
Other	9	1	So, uh, gals, ...you seem to really like queefing.	['queefing']
Other	23	1	Well Reeg, it's like this: we think that queefing is a perfectly normal female bodily function. Why not have fun with it?	['queefing']
Other	10	1	But I mean really, isn't queefing a bit juvenile?	['queefing']
Other	11	2	Men enjoy farts, so why shouldn't women enjoy their queefs?	['farts', 'queefs']
Other	17	1	That's right. We've written all about it in our new feminist book, Eat, Pray, Queef.	['queef']
Other	26	0	Well I think that what you gals are doing for the feminist movement is amazing. And that's why women all over America stand behind you.	[]
Other	2	0	D'ohhh!	[]
Other	26	0	Terrance and Phillip, you've put on a terrific show for many many years. You've made Canada Channel what it is today. You're fired.	[]
Other	1	0	Fired?!	[]
Other	37	2	Sorry guys, but this queefing thing is really catching on.  Queef Sisters' ratings are through the roof, and to pay them what they're asking we've gotta get rid of you. Goodbye. Here's some cookies.	['queefing', 'queef']
Other	5	0	Brian, don't do this!	[]
Other	17	0	You can't let Canada Channel be soiled by that perverse garbage! You know it's sick!	[]
Other	39	2	Yes, I know it's sick. To be honest, I gag every time one of them lets out a queef.  But it's money Goddammit and this channel needs it! I'm sorry, Terrance & Phillip, your show is done!	['queef', 'goddammit']
Other	155	2	I always love when Spring is on the way. Such a fun and inspiring time to decorate. Just like most women out there I've really gotten into queefing lately.  It's a lot of fun and interesting ways we can decorate our queefs and just make them more dynamic for the holidays. What we're gonna do is just... cut out some paper... like... this...  and cut out little stars and little moon shapes,  and we're gonna just... jam those... up... and they have custom simple little sparkles from the hobby stores; they come in... little tube which make them very easy to just...  shoot... right up the ol'... there we are.. And of course you can feel free to add little flowers or maybe some festive Easter grass. But the point is that when we're done we can... let one rip.  See how pretty that was? It's a good thing.	['queefing', 'queefs']
Randy	3	0	What was that?	[]
Other	11	0	Oh, excuse me, I...  I, I had a little air trapped.	[]
Randy	9	0	Oh my God, did you just...? At the table?	[]
Other	2	0	Pardon me.	[]
Stan	2	0	Mom, gross!	[]
Randy	13	0	Okay, that's enough, girls! Alright? I mean, how old are you, Sharon?	[]
Other	14	0	Sorry, it's just ...it's kind of funny how much it bothers you.	[]
Randy	7	0	Oh yeah. Yeah, that's really funny!	[]
Stan	3	0	Stop it, Mom!	[]
Randy	12	0	Yeah okay? Let's just try to have a nice dinner, okay?	[]
Other	8	0	Okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.	[]
Randy	2	0	Sharon! Marsh!	[]
Other	3	0	Ex-cuse me.	[]
Other	13	1	Hey Mom, do you like Australia? 'Cause that was the Great Barrier Queef.	['queef']
Randy	6	0	That's it, I'm leaving!	[]
Stan	4	0	I'm going too.	[]
Other	19	1	Oh! Oh please, Randy! How many times have you farted in bed and held my head under the covers?!	['farted']
Randy	4	0	That's completely different!	[]
Stan	5	0	Yeah it's different, Mom!	[]
Other	26	1	Alright, tell me exactly where the line is. Er, okay, how about this? I have a friend Abbie. She had a baby boy and it farted.	['farted']
Randy	2	0	Heh, yeah?	[]
Other	15	1	But she was actually still pregnant with the baby boy and it farted inside her.	['farted']
Randy	1	0	Yeah?	[]
Other	17	2	And then the gas from the baby's fart traveled down and shot out her vagina, haHA.	['fart', 'vagina']
Randy	6	0	Come on Stanley, let's go.	[]
Other	9	0	Oh! Oh, so when does that stop being funny?!	[]
Randy	13	1	It stopped being funny the second that air came out her vagina, Sharon!	['vagina']
Other	6	1	Look Katherine, I made queef cookies!	['queef']
Other	12	1	But those are just ginger snaps, Katie.  Could you get that, Katie?	['ginger']
Other	12	0	Oh my God! Look, Katherine! It's Canadian television stars Terrance & Phillip!	[]
Other	26	1	Oh my God, they're famous!  Well hello sirs! It is such an honor to meet you! Oh Katie, I'm getting all goosebumpy and queefy.	['queefy']
Other	1	0	Wooo.	[]
Other	5	0	May we come in, please?	[]
Other	9	0	Oh certainly, though I feel we look a mess.	[]
Other	12	0	Very nice place you have here. Network must be paying you well.	[]
Other	12	0	Oho yes, the show is going aboat as well as it could.	[]
Other	14	1	All right, enough with the queefing! We didn't come for a social call!	['queefing']
Other	9	0	That's right! We've come to kill you!	[]
Other	6	0	Why kill us? We love you.	[]
Other	11	0	Because you've reduced Canada Channel to smut and toilet humor!	[]
Other	19	0	Oh. Well I suppose if we're going to die, we should die by the hands of our idols.	[]
Other	2	0	Your idols?	[]
Other	33	0	We grew up watching you. You meant the world to us. We used to fantasize about pleasing you in all different ways. Know that it is an honor to die by your hand.	[]
Other	9	0	I don't think I can do it, Phillip.	[]
Other	2	0	Why not?	[]
Other	10	0	Because I'm suddenly finding myself strangely attracted to Katherine.	[]
Other	11	0	What?! That's crazy, Terrance! Katie is obviously the hot one.	[]
Butters	2	0	Ohhhhh ohhhhh.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Hey Butters. How you holding up, man?	[]
Butters	3	0	Oh. Hey fellas.	[]
Cartman	27	1	We got you a present, Butters. I'll put it here on your nightstand 'cause none of us want to touch you since you got queefed on.	['queefed']
Butters	2	0	Aw thanks.	[]
Stan	17	1	Butters, I'm afraid things have gotten worse. All the women suddenly think that... queefing is funny.	['queefing']
Butters	2	0	Ohhhhh ohhhhh!	[]
Kyle	15	0	Calm down Butters! The men are taking action. But we need to take your picture.	[]
Butters	3	0	My, my picture?	[]
Cartman	20	1	You're going to be the face of queef abuse, Butters, so that we can make people open their eyes.	['queef']
Other	1	0	AAH!	[]
Other	9	1	Dammit I'm trying to enjoy my wine, Katie!	['dammit']
Other	7	1	No, that was me, Phillip. I farted.	['farted']
Other	1	0	Oh.	[]
Other	15	0	Oh, this is a dream come true. I've always wanted to meet you, Phillip.	[]
Other	4	0	Phillip?! I'm Terrance!	[]
Other	6	0	What? I thought you were Terrance.	[]
Other	4	0	No, I'm Phillip!	[]
Other	2	0	Oh dear.	[]
Other	19	1	A disgusting, violating trend is taking over our city, our state, our nation. Queefing has become an acceptable evil.	['queefing']
Cartman	28	1	Last week at our school, a girl queefed right into our friend's face. That is why we are here to tell you  it's not a joke.	['queefed']
Stan	15	1	On television us children are starting to see and hear more and more graphic queefing.	['queefing']
Randy	52	4	I would like to take this opportunity to explain why farts are funny and queefs are not. Men have always joked about farts and we in fact name our farts. We have The Squeaker  And then there's The Foghorn  and the Don't be scared  and of course there's the-	['farts', 'queefs', 'farts', 'farts']
Other	21	1	Excuse me.  Well if that really is your argument, it isn't a very sound one. Women name their queefs too.	['queefs']
Other	5	0	That's right! We do.	[]
Other	10	0	For instance, we have the Sneezing Unicorn.  and The Resuscitator	[]
Cartman	4	0	Sick! Stop it, lady!	[]
Randy	12	0	Th-that's not the same! We've got the Chinese Firecracker!	[]
Other	13	0	That's all well and good, but we can do the Road Warrior.	[]
Other	27	0	Nooo! We go iiin! We kiiill! No more talk! We kiiill! Soon, my dog of war, but we have to do it my way.  Losers! Losers wait!	[]
Other	1	0	AWWW!	[]
Randy	2	0	Jesus Christ!	[]
Other	10	2	You stupid bitch, what the fuck is wrong with you?!	['bitch', 'fuck']
Other	9	2	I'm not your sex toy, you fucking pig!	['sex', 'fucking']
Other	12	2	Ugh! You don't queef in bed while we're having sex!	['queef', 'sex']
Other	8	2	Fuck you, you don't fucking slap me!	['fuck', 'fucking']
Other	14	1	Could you please keep it down? We're trying to have sex over here.	['sex']
Other	8	2	She queefed while we were having sex, Terrance!	['queefed', 'sex']
Other	1	0	SICK!	[]
Other	16	1	Well what's the big deal? I've been queefing in this bed the entire time.	['queefing']
Other	2	0	What?! Gross!	[]
Other	3	0	How dare you?!	[]
Other	14	0	Get out! Get out both of you!  We never want to see you again!	[]
Other	6	0	After everything we've been through?	[]
Other	15	1	What the hell am I going to do, Phillip? She makes me so mad sometimes.	['hell']
Other	17	1	Katherine just won't stop queefing, but I don't know if I can live without her.	['queefing']
Other	7	0	Katie, I'm sorry. I was wrong.	[]
Other	14	2	Me too, Katherine. I don't love your queefs, but dammit, I love you.	['queefs', 'dammit']
Other	2	0	Oh Terrance.	[]
Other	1	0	Phillip!	[]
Randy	15	1	Oh my God!  Ohmygod! Stan!  Stan, we did it! Colorado Senate moves to ban queefing!	['queefing']
Stan	6	0	No way! We did it?!  Yeah!!	[]
Randy	3	0	Alright son! Yeah!!	[]
Other	4	0	What's going on?	[]
Randy	9	1	HA! Read it and weep, Sharon! No more queefing!	['queefing']
Other	10	0	Well, ...congratulations, guys. Looks like you got us. Good job.	[]
Randy	10	1	Aw come on.  Just because you can't queef anymore...	['queef']
Other	102	1	You really think women cared that much about queefing? Is that really what you think this has all been about? This has been about women having a little bit of fun for once at your expense. For just this one time we could be the immature ones to make you feel uncomfortable. But no, you just couldn't let us have that one little thing, could you? Because even though things are getting better for women, you still think of us as lesser people sometimes, and we always have to prove ourselves twice as hard. Congratulations, guys.  For getting your way... again.	['queefing']
Stan	5	0	Mom, we didn't mean...	[]
Randy	12	0	Boy oh boy. I think we might have screwed up royal, Stan.	[]
Stan	24	0	Yeah. We all got so caught up in how we felt that we didn't realize... women actually cared about something a lot deeper.	[]
Randy	13	0	Stan, let's call the guys together. Maybe we can make this right.	[]
Randy	14	0	There's a time in our lives when we must listen to the oppressed.	[]
Other	8	0	And realize we've been keeping women down.	[]
Mr. Mackey	7	0	They have power and they have courage.	[]
Other	8	0	And we must all stand by the belief,	[]
Other	12	1	That a woman is strong, and she has the right to queef.	['queef']
Other	16	2	Fly free. Free to queef aloud; fly free. Let every queef show that you're proud.	['queef', 'queef']
Randy	12	0	You face so many challenges to put an end to your grief.	[]
Other	10	1	You are woman now, and you are free to queef.	['queef']
Cartman	13	0	It's time for equality. We must give them the respect they deserve.	[]
Mr. Garrison	17	0	They're just the same as you and me. Their rights must be preserrrr-r-r-rrrved.	[]
Other	48	9	Queef free (Queef free). Every woman has the right; queef free (Queef free). Let your queefing stars shine bright.You are woman, hear you roar (queef free), queefing too loud to ignore. Queef a little each day and let your soul take flight! Ah-aaaaaaah-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah, queef free.	['queef', 'queef', 'queef', 'queef', 'queefing', 'queef', 'queefing', 'queef', 'queef']
Other	25	0	For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.  Nooo!	[]
Other	8	0	Stop it, Katherine! This is a serious moment!	[]
Other	9	0	Therefore what God has joined together let no man-	[]
Other	2	0	Aww. sick!	[]
Other	10	2	That's it! I now pronounce you farts and queefs!	['farts', 'queefs']
