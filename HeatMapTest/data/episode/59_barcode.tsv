Other	8	1	Today, we are going to talk about hell.	['hell']
Other	2	0	Hello, Satan!	[]
Other	1	0	Saddam...	[]
Other	7	2	Us Jews don't believe in hell.	['jews', 'hell']
Kyle	6	0	But what if we're wrong?	[]
Stan	3	0	Let's go.	[]
Stan	4	0	...they've killed Kenny!	[]
Butters	8	0	He had sins that he didn't confess!	[]
Other	10	0	No, Saddam, I told you. I'm with Chris now.	[]
Other	13	0	Boys, it is your Christian duty to save the souls of your friends!	[]
Other	4	0	I love you, Satan.	[]
Other	5	0	I love you too, Saddam.	[]
Other	1	0	Wuh?!	[]
Other	14	0	Fonz, there's no way you can jump that shark with your water skis.	[]
Other	6	0	Aaaay! I've gotta try, Richie.	[]
Other	2	0	Oh, huhuh.	[]
Stan	13	1	Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us?	['hell']
Cartman	15	0	Well, it looks like we're gonna have to save everyone in this town ourselves!	[]
Other	2	0	Go Fonz!!!	[]
Other	1	0	Aaaaaa--	[]
Other	8	0	And now the exciting conclusion of... South Park.	[]
Other	6	0	-aaaaaayy-err.  No!  No!  No!  No!	[]
Other	8	0	I told him he couldn't do it.	[]
Cartman	47	1	I am saying this because we must be saved-uh. The Lord is powerful and he will smote the sinners and send them to everlasting hell-uh. If you do not live your life for Him-uh, then to the lake of fire you shall go-uh!	['hell']
Other	42	1	You see that, parents? Your children have refused to come into class since this morning. I'm afraid your son is the leader, Ms. Cartman.  Apparently he's read the entire Bible, and now he's scaring the hell out of everyone.	['hell']
Other	12	1	Boopie-kins.  It's time to stop preaching damnation to everyone, sweetie.	['damnation']
Stan	9	0	Don't you guys, um... persecrute our religious beliefs.	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Other	16	0	We are not trying to persecute you kids, but you're supposed to be in school.	[]
Stan	22	0	What purpose does school have? The Bible says the only goal in this life is to praise God and get into heaven.	[]
Kyle	9	0	Yeah, this life is short. The afterlife is forever.	[]
Other	12	0	Don't listen to them, kids. You have to go to school.	[]
Cartman	110	2	Many of you knew Kenny McCormick. He was a playful school-going eight-year-old. And then yesterday, he was  smacked down by the Lord-uh!  God bitch-slapped him right to the fiery depths of hell! So when will you go? Tomorrow? Ten years? Does it mattah?! No! Because unless you give this life to the Lord, that life belongs to Satan-uh!  But we cannot worship God in that church where that priest of sin resides,  so we will build a new church-uh. With crystal walls, a ceiling 80 feet high, and a slide that connects this part hmya  to this part hmya.  Who will help us?	['bitch', 'hell']
Other	2	0	I will.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Praise God-uh!	[]
Other	55	0	If I go spend the night with Saddam, then it's over between me and Chris.  Chris has been so nice to me and I know Saddam will just hurt me again.  M-maybe I'll just go talk to Saddam. I need closure, yeah. That's it, I need closure.  What am I doing?	[]
Other	6	0	What took yo so long, baby?	[]
Other	7	0	Saddam, I'm just here to talk.	[]
Other	10	0	Great! Let's talk!  Hmm, this bed is comfy-bumpy.	[]
Other	9	0	Saddam, I only came here because I need closure.	[]
Other	9	0	Sounds fun. You know me, I'll try anything.	[]
Other	5	0	No! Saddam, listen to me.	[]
Other	5	0	Would you like a drink?	[]
Other	61	0	Um, maybe just... a little one.  I have to go back soon. I need you to understand that we can't be together anymore.  I need you to not come by the condo and not try to see me. Chris thinks we can all be friends, but I don't. And I have to focus on Chris now.  What is this?	[]
Other	8	0	These hotels have all kinds of crazy channels.	[]
Other	20	0	Saddam, will you listen to me?! Chris is a great person. He's the one I wanna be with now.	[]
Other	23	0	Really? So then... What are you doing here?  Well, I don't know about you, but this video is gettin' me pretty hot!	[]
Other	1	0	Saddam...	[]
Other	4	0	Here, have another drink.	[]
Other	11	0	Ooh, whoa... God, my head. Drank too much.  Chris?  Oh no!!	[]
Other	17	0	Man, look at that! We went through 14 bottles of vegetable oil!  Ewuh, I'm all greasy.	[]
Other	6	0	Oh God, what time is it?	[]
Other	9	0	Last night was awesome! Are we together again now?	[]
Other	18	0	I don't know. I-I guess so, but now I have to go home and tell Chris.	[]
Other	2	0	Screw him!!	[]
Other	19	0	No, Saddam! I at least owe him an explanation!  I just don't know what I'm gonna say.	[]
Other	8	0	I know how to solve this little problem.	[]
Other	48	0	We are now entering Ensenada, the second largest city on the Mexican Baja Peninsula.  We have now traveled over 2000 miles since leaving New York City. We'll just be stopping here for a few moments for gas, and then our tour will continue onto its final destination.	[]
Other	7	0	Oiga. Hay algo pegado bajo el autobus.	[]
Other	10	0	'Kay. What's stuck to the bottom of the bus?	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Ahow..!)	[]
Other	16	0	Oh, goodness! We must have run over a little Mexican further up north. Is it okay?	[]
Other	3	0	Pienso que si.	[]
Other	8	0	Well, here's fifty for the gas.  Adios.	[]
Kenny	3	0	(Where am I?)	[]
Other	1	0	Que?	[]
Kenny	3	0	(Where am I?)	[]
Other	1	0	Que?	[]
Cartman	9	0	This is bea-utiful. Thine church is almost completed.	[]
Stan	13	1	There's no way God will want to send us to hell now.	['hell']
Kyle	9	0	Yeah, this church kicks a-- Eh... I-it kicks!	[]
Other	2	0	Hello, boys.	[]
Kyle	19	1	Don't try to take me away again, Mom and Dad! I told you! I renounced the Jewish faith!	['jewish']
Other	28	0	It's not that, Kyle. It's just that Eric's mother needs to see you all right away.  Just really quick; she says it's very important.	[]
Cartman	16	0	Very well. Yea. Guys, let us walk to mine home and see what mine mom wants.	[]
Other	5	0	I sure hope this works.	[]
Other	10	0	Hello, kiddies. I made you all powdered doughnut pancake surprise.	[]
Stan	2	0	Wow, cool.	[]
Cartman	11	0	No! This is a trick! Do not vex me, O temptress!	[]
Other	1	0	What?	[]
Cartman	52	0	This is a distraction from our work on the church!  Do not think that you can tempt us with toys  and new games  and tidings of powdered doughnut pancake surprise! For it is the afterlife we have concerned ourselves with!  Not the pleasures of this Earth, but salvation in the world aftah!!	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Other	4	0	Oh. Well,  alrighty then.	[]
Other	6	0	I... don't think it worked.	[]
Other	1	0	Aww.	[]
Cartman	18	0	Let us get back to our work at the church.  Yea. I shall answer the phone, hyah.  Hello?	[]
Kenny	13	0	(Cartman?! Cartman, you've gotta help me, and I'm not foolin' around!)	[]
Cartman	3	0	Oh my God!!	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Cartman	10	0	It's Kenny. He's calling from beyond the grave!	[]
Stan	5	0	Kenny?!  What's he say?	[]
Kyle	6	1	Ask him what hell is like.	['hell']
Cartman	14	1	Kenny! You have to tell us about hell! Give us every last horrible detail!	['hell']
Kenny	1	0	(Um...)	[]
Other	14	0	Oh, God, Chris is gonna be so mad at me. Well, here it goes.	[]
Other	2	0	Hey, you.	[]
Other	2	0	Hi, Chris.	[]
Other	5	0	You... were out all night.	[]
Other	10	0	Yeah, I just... spent the night walking around the marina.	[]
Other	18	0	Satan. You know you're not a very good liar. You went and saw Saddam, didn't you?	[]
Other	1	0	Yes.	[]
Other	3	0	Satan, I understand.	[]
Other	1	0	What?	[]
Other	8	0	I still feel secure and safe with you.	[]
Other	3	0	Oh, n-no!	[]
Other	9	0	What? What's wrong? I said it's okay.	[]
Other	2	0	I know.	[]
Other	8	0	Well, what more do you want from me?	[]
Other	40	2	Well... could you not be such a pussy about it? I mean, can't you just say If you ever see Saddam again, I'll break your legs! or, or I'm gonna go kick Saddam's ass! or something?	['pussy', 'ass']
Other	24	0	Satan, I'm a '90s man. I cry when I need to. I share my feelings and I keep my mind open about everything.	[]
Other	16	0	Just... give me some boundaries, be jealous, go throw a football around, for Christ's sake.	[]
Other	8	0	Now you're starting to hurt my feelings.	[]
Other	38	0	Ah-I'm sorry, Chris, it's... it's not you, really, it's, it's me.  You're the best thing that's ever happened to me, and for some reason, I just can't accept that.	[]
Other	2	1	Die, pussy!	['pussy']
Other	1	0	Agghhh!	[]
Other	8	1	Chris!  Saddam, what the hell are you doing?!	['hell']
Other	14	0	There. I got rid of the problem for you. Now there's no conflict.	[]
Other	4	0	No! Not like this..!	[]
Cartman	59	4	Friends, I have to tell you that last night I received a phone call from beyond the grave-eh.  It was our departed friend, Kenny! Calling from the depths of hell! And he described what hell is like in horrid detail-uh.  He said that in hell, the smell is awful. He said that in hell, everyone speaks Spanish.	['hell', 'hell', 'hell', 'hell']
Other	1	0	Wagghh..!	[]
Cartman	22	2	He said there is water in hell, but if you drink it you pee blood out your ass for seven hours-uh!	['hell', 'ass']
Other	1	0	Whoa!	[]
Cartman	27	1	And perhaps worst of all, in hell, there are dozens and dozens of little trinket stores! But they all have the same little trinkets in them-eh!	['hell']
Other	1	0	Wagghh!	[]
Other	4	0	Where is our daughter?	[]
Other	1	0	Dad?	[]
Other	7	0	Marcy! You're coming home this instant!	[]
Cartman	11	1	We are saving your daughter from the clutches of hell, suh!	['hell']
Other	11	0	You're not gonna make my daughter part of your cult!	[]
Cartman	8	0	Your daughter could die tomorrow, and then what?!	[]
Other	12	1	You're just a stupid little fat kid who thinks that--  Aagghh--!	['fat']
Other	3	0	Stephen?  Stephen, no!	[]
Cartman	14	0	The Lord has spoken again-uh! O, forgive us, Lord, for our sins-uh!	[]
Other	3	0	Forgive us, Lord.	[]
Cartman	20	1	Let us pray.  Heavenly Father, do not send us to hell. We're sorry. Whatever we did, we're sorry.	['hell']
Other	2	0	Stephen? Stephen?	[]
Other	4	0	Where... where am I?	[]
Other	3	0	Where are we?	[]
Other	4	0	No doubt about it...	[]
Other	3	0	What's happening??	[]
Other	1	0	Oooooooooh!	[]
Other	72	2	Hello, newcomers, and welcome. Can everybody hear me?  Hello? Can everyb--? Okay.  Uh, I'm the hell director. Uh, it looks like we have about 8,615 of you newbies today, and for those of you who are a little confused, uh, you are dead, and this is hell, so, abandon all hope and uh yada yada yada. Uh, we are now going to start the orientation process, which will last about--	['hell', 'hell']
Other	23	0	Hey, wait a minute, I shouldn't be here. I was a totally strict and devout Protestant! I thought we went to heaven!	[]
Other	8	0	Yes, well I'm afraid you were wrong.	[]
Other	7	0	I was a practicing Jehovah's Witness.	[]
Other	8	0	Uh, you picked the wrong religion as well.	[]
Other	8	0	Well, who was right? Who gets into heaven?	[]
Other	14	0	I'm afraid it was the Mormons. Yes, the Mormons were the correct answer.	[]
Other	1	0	Awww.	[]
Other	16	0	So now I'd like to quickly introduce your new ruler and master for eternity, Satan.	[]
Other	1	0	Oooyeah!	[]
Other	1	0	Aaggghh!	[]
Other	37	1	Now you are all part of my domain! Everyday in hell grows larger as my minions... my m-minions uh...  muh, I'm sorry. I just can't do this today. I'm just... I'm sorry.	['hell']
Other	13	0	Uh, okay. Thank you, Satan. Now, uh, let's begin with the Muslims...	[]
Other	5	0	Satan!  'Scuse me. Excuse me.	[]
Other	7	0	Chris!  But I thought you were dead!	[]
Other	8	0	Yeah, well, where was I gonna go? Detroit?	[]
Other	11	0	Chris, I didn't mean for Saddam to stab you in--	[]
Other	18	0	Hey, it's alright. All that matters is that I'm back, and we're together forever. Right?	[]
Other	4	0	Uh... yeah. Gr-great.	[]
Other	1	0	Awww.	[]
Cartman	35	0	Let's see... Matthew 15:11. Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which comes out of the mouth defileth a man. That's a good one, Clyde Frog. Interesting.	[]
Other	8	0	Eric, Sister Anne has come to visit you.	[]
Cartman	16	0	Yea. It is nice to see you, Sister, but I must prepare for my next sermon.	[]
Other	27	0	Eric, you need to stop what you're doing. You need to tell all the kids to go back to school, and back to their normal lives.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Sister, have you read this book?	[]
Other	8	0	Yes, Eric. A lot more than you have.	[]
Cartman	16	0	Then you know what it says happens to those who don't follow the Lord-uh.	[]
Other	22	1	Eric, the Lord just doesn't send everybody to hell. That wouldn't make sense. He wants people to live their lives.	['hell']
Cartman	11	0	Are you saying that what the Bible says isn't true?	[]
Other	1	0	No.	[]
Cartman	41	1	We've got Jews and perverts and bullies and all kinds of sinners in this town, Sister Anne-uh! And without the priest we've decided to save ourselves. The only ones that kids can trust now are me and Jesus!	['jews']
Other	7	0	Uugh..!  Wait a minute. That's it.	[]
Other	17	0	...And I'm gonna save all of you right now.  I'm gonna heal your sins-eh.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Well...	[]
Other	7	1	Hello Satan-ooh, crap! It's you!	['crap']
Other	4	0	Yeah. It's me.	[]
Other	5	0	I thought I killed you!	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah...	[]
Other	7	0	Well, where was I gonna go? Detroit?	[]
Other	2	0	Right, right.	[]
Other	12	0	Do you have a couple of minutes to go for a walk?	[]
Other	2	0	A walk?	[]
Other	9	0	Yeah. Just real quick. Around the park or somethin'.	[]
Other	6	0	Is this some kind of trick?	[]
Other	14	0	No, I just want you to go for a quick walk with me. Please?	[]
Other	13	0	Well, alright. Just let me grab somethin' real quick.  Okay, let's walk.	[]
Other	13	0	Saddam, I get the feeling that you don't like me very much.	[]
Other	13	0	Gee, whatever gave you that idea? When I stabbed you in the head?	[]
Other	62	0	Look, Satan is a very important person to me. And I know he's an important person to you, too. So don't you think it's best for us to just... try and get along? I realize that some things about me bother you. So I'd like to hear what those things are so that I can work on them.	[]
Other	40	1	You know why I don't like you, Chris? Because you're the kind of guy who, if someone didn't like him, would take him for a walk in the park and ask him why. You're a pussy!	['pussy']
Other	3	0	Agghhh!  Oh God!	[]
Other	2	0	Ah hahaha!	[]
Other	2	0	Nooo! Agh!	[]
Other	1	0	Aggghhh!	[]
Other	3	0	Ow!  Goo-aagh..!	[]
Cartman	20	1	Today this Jewish boy and all sinners are going to be saved-uh! Kyle, do you believe in God-uh?	['jewish']
Kyle	1	0	Yes!	[]
Cartman	9	1	Do you want to be saved from hell-uh?!	['hell']
Kyle	1	0	Yes!	[]
Cartman	24	1	That's good, because right now, all the Jewness is comin' out of your body, bein' replaced by the Spirit of God-uh!  Theah!	['jewness']
Kyle	1	0	Ow!	[]
Cartman	17	0	Praise God! How do you feel now? Do you feel the light of God inside o'ya?	[]
Kyle	4	0	Uh, I think so.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Praise the Lord-uh!	[]
Other	6	0	Praise the Lord. Hallelujah! Praise God!	[]
Cartman	30	1	For he is Lord, he is Lord... Bring up the next person!  This boy has been crippled with sin-uh. But I hear God saying that this boy will walk!	['crippled']
Butters	2	0	Huh-Hallelujah!	[]
Other	1	0	Timmiiiy!	[]
Cartman	14	0	We are gonna save you and you are gonna walk with the Lord-uh!	[]
Other	1	0	Timmiiiy!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Devil be  gone-uh!	[]
Other	1	0	Haagggh.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Now walk, Timmih!	[]
Other	1	0	Haagggh.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Come on, Timmy, get out of that chair-uh!	[]
Other	1	0	Haghh.	[]
Cartman	10	0	The Lord wants you to walk, Timmih! Oo-walk, Timmih!	[]
Other	1	0	Timmilih?	[]
Cartman	3	0	He walks-uh!	[]
Other	1	0	Whoa!	[]
Other	2	0	Oh-aagghhh!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Yes! Praise the Lord!	[]
Other	3	0	Praise the Lord!	[]
Other	40	2	And now it's like there's one guy who's horrible to me but I'm totally sexually attracted to, and then one guy who's really nice to me but I'm not sexually attracted to at all.	['sexually', 'sexually']
Other	4	0	Wow, that really sucks.	[]
Other	13	0	I've asked everybody for advice, but nobody seems to know the answer.	[]
Other	15	0	Well, there is one person who I always used to ask when I needed advice.	[]
Other	1	0	Who?	[]
Other	1	0	God.	[]
Other	16	0	God?? I can't do that. I haven't spoken to God in like, 5000 years.	[]
Other	6	0	Well then, maybe it's time.	[]
Other	9	0	Do dodo dum do dodoDo dodo dum do dodo	[]
Cartman	11	0	For he is LordLord, Lord, LordWhere are you from, little boy?	[]
Other	1	0	Denver.	[]
Cartman	13	0	And God is telling me that you have... bad eyesight. Is that it?	[]
Other	4	0	Yeah, that's right.	[]
Other	1	0	Wooooo!	[]
Cartman	14	0	Well, God is gonna heal those eyes, and save you from the devil begone!	[]

Cartman	15	0	He is gonna take that ugly face and make you reasonable to look at!  Bah!	[]
Other	1	0	Wagh...	[]
Cartman	7	0	Bwolololololololololololo! Oh, good Lord, somebody say Amen!	[]
Other	1	0	Amen!	[]
Other	3	0	Lord, Lord, Lord	[]
Other	19	0	Hi hi, welcome to heaven, brother. You've followed the Mormon faith, and so you've been let in!	[]
Other	7	0	Uh, actually, I'm just stopping by.	[]
Other	22	0	Well, you've picked a great time! We've got cookies and punch and we're just about to start playing charades.	[]
Other	2	0	Alright. Yeah.	[]
Other	20	0	And then, Brother Stephen's brought his guitar so we can sing songs about how much it hurts to lie.	[]
Other	1	0	Ooooh!	[]
Other	1	0	Yeahahah!	[]
Other	12	0	Ah, look, I just need to talk with God. Is he around?	[]
Other	14	0	Sure. All you have to do is say his name and he's there.	[]
Other	6	0	I'm so grateful for that.	[]
Other	4	0	Me, too. Uh huh.	[]
Other	2	0	Great. Thanks.	[]
Other	8	0	Ah... Hello? G-God? It's uh... Satan.	[]
Other	7	0	Yea. Look upon me, and know me.	[]
Other	2	0	Hi, God.	[]
Other	8	0	Hello, Satan.  It's... been a long time.	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Other	14	0	What brings you here? Do you wish to mount your unholy war against heaven?	[]
Other	10	0	No, I have a problem, and I... need your advice.	[]
Other	13	1	You want to rule more than hell? You want to destroy the Earth?	['hell']
Other	43	1	No, it's kind of a long story but, well, it all started when this Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein,  was killed by a pack of wild boars. I remember when I first met him in hell. It was a lovely morning in April...	['hell']
Cartman	69	0	Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! And now, I'm receiving a message directly from God-uh! God is telling me that... each and every one of you is to walk up to the stage, and give me one dollar!  So I want everyone to feel the love of God by coming up heah,  and putting a dollar in the box-ah!  Come on, don't be shy! Come on now!	[]
Stan	6	0	Dude, that seems kind of... weird.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Yeah. I don't remember him saying anything about this.	[]
Other	22	0	...And now Chris and Saddam just keep killing each other over and over and... I don't know which one to pick.	[]
Other	7	1	Jesus, what the hell happened to you?	['hell']
Other	1	0	Huh?	[]
Other	19	1	You got kicked out of here for being a headstrong rebel. And now you're a whiny little bitch.	['bitch']
Other	10	0	Well, I just don't know which one to pick.	[]
Other	76	1	No, you've become dependent on relationships. So you haven't even considered the option of not being with either of them.  And if you're not sexually attracted to someone, you're not ever going to be. But Saddam isn't right either. He's the other extreme. You need to spend time alone so that you can find the balance, the middle ground. That's what I always do, because I'm a Buddhist.	['sexually']
Other	37	0	God, you're right. You know, I've had steady relationships for the last... thousand years, and when one ends I just start another one, but... I haven't taken the time to be secure with myself.	[]
Other	1	0	Bingo.	[]
Other	11	0	Hey... Thanks, God. I forgot how clear you make things sometimes.	[]
Other	8	0	It was nice to see you again, Satan.	[]
Other	2	0	You too.	[]
Other	1	0	Goodbye.	[]
Other	10	0	Would you like to stay for some cookies and punch?	[]
Other	3	0	Yes, would you?	[]
Other	8	0	Uh, no, I need to be getting back.	[]
Other	11	0	Oh, alright then, but you're gonna miss our big play.	[]
Other	15	0	Yes. We're going to do a play about how alcohol can ruin family life.	[]
Other	10	0	Wow. That sounds great, but uh, I really  gotta go.	[]
Other	7	0	Well, he seemed like a nice fellow.	[]
Other	1	0	Yes.	[]
Other	9	0	Let's go make things out of egg cartons.	[]
Other	6	0	Oooh, yeah. I'll do that.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Yeess.  Yeess.  It worked, you guys, it actually worked!	[]
Stan	2	0	What worked?	[]
Cartman	16	0	Eh-everybody bought the whole act! They keep giving and giving until we have it all!	[]
Other	1	0	What?	[]
Kyle	6	0	You're keeping that money yourself?	[]
Cartman	32	0	Of course, you guys! And then we can make... ten million dollars!  Look, the tooth fairy thing didn't work, the boy band thing didn't last, so I tried this route.	[]
Stan	23	0	Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait. You mean that this whole thing has just been a way for you to make ten million dollars?	[]
Cartman	14	0	It all came to me days ago, when we were first in Sunday school.	[]
Stan	9	1	Well, what about going to hell and all that?!	['hell']
Cartman	19	1	Dude, if God is all-understanding, he wouldn't send us to hell. Even Sister Anne told me that.	['hell']
Kyle	7	0	Then why didn't you tell us?!	[]
Cartman	27	0	My brain is of a much larger size than you guys's. I couldn't expect you to understand, not until you actually saw the cash flow!	[]
Kyle	15	2	The only thing of yours that's larger in size is your big fat ass!	['fat', 'ass']
Cartman	3	1	Suck my balls!	['balls']
Stan	7	0	Dude, I an so disillusioned right now.	[]
Other	2	1	Die, pussy!	['pussy']
