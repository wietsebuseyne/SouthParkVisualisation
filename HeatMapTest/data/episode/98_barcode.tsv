Cartman	8	0	We didn't go to your comedy show.	[]

Kyle	13	0	Dude, that's not cool. You shouldn't make fun of Christopher Reeve.	[]

Other	16	0	Though it is controversial,  stem cell research is critical  in the quest for helping  the disabled.	[]
Other	12	1	I put together a comedy show and I was crippled from BIRTH!	['crippled']
Stan	13	0	Uh, hoo. Guys, I think we'd better stay out of this one.	[]

Kyle	1	0	What?	[]
Other	36	2	To be in our club, not only do you have to be c-c-crippled, but you have to have been born that way. Do you know what that means? No butthole Superman asswipe Christopher Reeve!	['crippled', 'butthole']
Stan	13	0	That's nice, guys. We're just gonna stay out of this one.	[]
Cartman	21	0	Hey, wait a minute!  You guys can't just start a club and tell me I can't be in it!	[]

Other	8	0	Hello, boys. What can I do for you?	[]
Other	21	0	Timmy and I made a ...T-shirt design for our new club.  We just came up with a name this morning.	[]
Other	11	0	Uh... boys, I don't think you wanna wear these shirts	[]
Other	2	0	Why not?	[]
Other	23	0	Well, because there already is a group that calls themselves the Crips, and I don't think they'd like it too much.	[]
Other	5	0	...There's already a Crips?!	[]
Other	18	0	Well, sure, they're all over at Five Points area in Denver. You've never heard of them?	[]
Other	17	2	No, we never have. Are they crippled from birth or are they cripple wannabes like Christopher Reeve?	['crippled', 'cripple']
Other	8	0	...Oh, I am stayin' out of this one.	[]
Other	24	1	Can you believe it, Timmy? All this time there was a group for truly crippled people like ourselves, and we didn't know it.	['crippled']
Other	1	0	Timmmeh!	[]
Other	13	0	Come on. We have to take the bus to Five Points in Denver.	[]
Other	29	0	My guest tonight is the brilliant star of stage and screen, Mr. Christopher Reeve, who,. with the help of stem-cell research, is now able to move his arms.	[]
Other	7	0	Thanks for having me on again, Larry.	[]
Other	49	0	All right. Chris, the whole world is waiting. Why don't you show us what stem-cell research has done for you.  Amazing. Isn't that amazing, folks? Now, Chris, there're some people who say stem-cell research is wrong, that takling cells from a fetus is... unethical.	[]
Other	44	0	Well, it just proves that the public needs to be educated  about stem-cell research. See, the stem cells from a fetus like this one  can form into whatever cells of the body are damaged. They are the most powerful thing on the planet.	[]
Other	13	0	And how does someone like yourself make use of the stem cells, Chris?	[]
Other	15	0	Well, it's very simple.  And now you can see, my arms have better movement.	[]
Other	2	0	Wow.  Wow.	[]
Other	14	0	Excuse me, sir.  we're looking for a group of people called the Crips.	[]
Other	2	0	You are?	[]
Other	16	0	Do you know where they meet? We've already tried the rec center and the library.	[]
Other	15	0	The Crips hang out at that old warehouse down there,  but ...nobody goes in there.	[]
Other	12	0	Oh, it's okay. We're Crips ourselves. Come on, Tim-Tim.	[]
Other	1	0	Timmmih!	[]
Other	13	0	Well hello everyone.  I'm Jim Swanson, and this is my friend Timmy.	[]

Other	5	0	Is they for real, manh?	[]
Other	30	0	We just have one question before we join your c-club. Do you think it's better to be born a Crip, or to become a Crip later by accident?	[]
Other	7	0	The only Crips is born Crips, dawg.	[]
Other	10	0	Yeah, you can't become a Crip by accident, fool!	[]
Other	26	1	I agree. I mean, it's like  come on! Why do these people who become crippled later in life think they're such great pot-potatuhs?	['crippled']

Other	15	1	Say Timmy, did you notice that all the crippled people in that club are negros?	['crippled']
Other	1	0	Timmih!	[]
Other	18	1	That's an amm-mmazing coincidence. I mean, there's not one crippled colored person in South Park.	['crippled']
Other	3	0	Hey you kids.	[]
Other	3	0	Well hello, officers.	[]
Other	9	1	What the hell do you think you're doin'?	['hell']
Other	9	1	We're goin' to pop some punk-ass Bloods.	['ass']
Other	1	0	Timmih!	[]
Other	49	2	Look, Timmy. There's a convenience store.  That must be what the fellas meant by pop some punk-ass Bloods. They want us to get them some soda pop and treats.  Let's buy them ginger ale and marshmallows. Then they'll let us in the club for sure.	['ass', 'ginger']

Other	20	0	No need to worry about me. I'm cool like a fool in a swimming ppp-ppp-pp-pp-pool.	[]
Other	27	0	Tom, I'm standing out front of the Stem Cell Research Facility with terrific news. Christopher Reeve, who was once paralyzed, claims that he can now stand.	[]
Other	20	0	Thank you everyone.  To most people, this is just an ordinary fetus. But to people like me,  it's hope.	[]
Other	1	0	Uugh.	[]
Mr. Garrison	3	0	What an inspiration.	[]
Other	21	0	Tom, many celebrities have spoken out in protest of stem-cell research, but, after seeing this, how can they protest now?	[]
Stan	5	0	Stay clear, guys, stay clear.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Yup. I'm not seeing anything.	[]
Other	8	0	Hey  Hey, I don't want no trouber!	[]

Other	24	0	A what? Oh, you mean the fellas. Well sure. But I can't talk about the club on account of its sssuper secret, dawg.	[]
Other	9	0	Then it's true! Oh, Ryan, it's true!	[]
Other	18	0	Why you be trippin', Mom? I mean  come on. I'm finally a part of something, very much.	[]
Other	11	0	Jimmy, those people you're hanging out with are no good.	[]
Other	13	1	Yo, don't be dissing my niggaz, dawg. They're my f... friends.	['niggaz']
Other	16	0	And what about your standup comedy, Jim, huh? Are you just giving up on that, too?	[]
Other	22	1	Nobody cared about my standup comedy! All that hard work just to be outshined by C-Christopher Reeve the super b-butthole!	['butthole']
Other	17	0	Uh Jimmy, we've told you before. God made you the way he did for a reason!	[]
Other	15	1	Right. Because you and Mom used to make fun of crippled kids in high school.	['crippled']
Other	30	0	That's right. You were sent here through the vengeful and angry hand of God to teach your mother and I a lesson. And that's a big responsibility, son.	[]
Other	42	1	Look! My gang, which I can't talk about because it's super secret, is the most important thing to me now! And if you two don't like it, you can just pass the blunt to the nigga on your left.	['nigga']
Other	10	0	Where's that delivery of new fetuses?! Feeling weak again.	[]
Other	7	0	Here's the new shipment, sir.  Hey!	[]
Other	3	0	Hello there, Christopher.	[]
Other	12	0	Well, well, Gene Hackman, my nemesis from the movies. How are you?	[]
Other	4	0	I'm good. You?	[]
Other	11	0	I am better with each passing day.  Stronger and more agile.	[]
Other	13	0	Christopher, I've come to ask you to stop what you're doing?	[]
Other	1	0	What?	[]
Other	12	0	Using stem cells is like playing God. You should leave nature alone.	[]
Other	15	0	And go back to the way I was? Is that what you're saying, Hackman?	[]
Other	17	0	I'm saying that sometimes you need to just live with the cards you're dealt, Christopher.	[]
Other	38	0	Stop calling me Christopher! That name no longer has meaning to me! Christopher was someone who lived in a wheelchair! Always being pushed around by others! The old Christopher Reeve is dead! From now on, I am...  Chris!	[]
Other	9	0	Sixty-five... bottles of... beer on the wall. Six-	[]
Other	3	1	Payback time, mothafucka!	['mothafucka']

Other	3	0	East Side Bloods!	[]
Other	13	0	We're Detectives Hyde and Richardson from the Special Gang unit in Denver.	[]
Other	12	0	Any word on who shot up me and Timmy's houses, officer?	[]
Other	13	0	Word on the street is it was a retaliation hit by the Bloods.	[]
Other	3	0	The... B-Bloods?	[]
Other	22	0	You know, smart-mouth! Your rival gang! The Bloods are at war with the Crips, they kill each other all the time!	[]
Other	3	0	The-they do??	[]
Other	32	0	Don't act like you don't know, you lil punk! The Crips and Bloods hate each other, and if you stay in that gang, you're gonna end up dead too.	[]
Other	8	0	But... but why do they hate each other?	[]
Other	14	0	Look kid, I used to be a Crip myself, but I'm not anymore!	[]
Other	9	0	Oh, so you used ssstemm cells like Christopher Reeve?	[]
Other	17	0	Come on. The only way these kids are gonna get out of their gang is get killed.	[]
Other	1	0	Sarah!	[]
Other	33	2	Oh boy, Timmy, we should have never started a gang for people crippled from birth. Now they're at war with the people who are crippled from an accident. Boy were we wrong.	['crippled', 'crippled']
Other	2	0	Tim-mih.	[]
Other	88	0	Wow, w-we've got to do something, Timmy. We've gotta get the Crips and Bloods to sstop fighting. I bet if we could just get them together... but how? Wu-wait a minute! I've got it! A lock-in at the rec center! We did it for our church once. All we do is rent out the rec center overnight. They lock the doors so nobody can leave, and then everyone has the whole night to play in the swimming pool and laugh and talk.	[]
Other	1	0	Timmih!!	[]
Other	24	0	You get all the Crips you can to the rec center tomorrow night, Timmy. And I'll try to get all the ...Bloods there.	[]
Other	1	0	Timmih!!	[]
Other	6	0	This is gonna be t-terrific!	[]
Other	66	0	Tom, several years ago, actor Christopher Reeve had a horrible accident and was paralyzed. The irony, of course, is that the man who played Superman could no longer walk. America watched in wonder as he managed to move one of his fingers, then his arms. And now, seen for the first time on HBC, Christopher Reeve is going to lift a truck up over his head.	[]
Randy	4	0	Oh, what a fighter.	[]
Other	4	0	That brave, brave man.	[]
Other	7	0	He's an imspration to us all.	[]
Other	22	0	Tom, the irony is even more irony-y as it appears that the stem cells have given Christopher Reeve almost superhuman strength.	[]
Other	4	0	Chris, that's enough!	[]
Other	7	0	Hello, Gene! So good to see you!	[]
Other	12	0	You're cured, Chris. It's time to stop using stem cells.	[]
Other	15	0	Stem-cell research has made me stronger than I ever thought possible! Why stop now?!	[]
Other	41	0	Uh Tom, apparently, Gene Hackman, the man who played Superman's enemy Lex Luthor in the movies, has now shown up as a celebrity protester of stem-cell research. If that isn't ironic, Tom, I don't knw what is.	[]
Other	19	0	They're affecting your mind, Chris. If you won't stop using stem cells, then we'll stop you!	[]
Other	24	0	Stop me?! Stop me?! HA!!  You won't stop me, Hack Man!  Ha HA! Ha HA! Ha haa haa!  Ya ha ha! Yaa haha!	[]
Other	18	0	Tom, if irony were made of strawberries, we'd all be drinking a lot of smoothies right now.	[]
Other	21	0	Come on in, everybody. Lots of su-surprises and t-treats inside.  Great to see you all. What a terrific audience.	[]
Other	10	0	Are you sure you got everything you need, young man?	[]
Other	8	0	We sure do. Thanks, Mr. Apple...b-by.	[]
Other	13	0	Just remember to make sure the kids play safe in the pool area.	[]
Other	2	0	You bet.	[]
Other	16	0	I'll be back at seven to let you out. You kids have a good time.	[]
Other	3	0	Oh, we will.	[]
Other	2	0	The Bloods!	[]
Other	6	1	Oh shit! It's a trap!	['shit']
Other	8	1	Muthafucka Crips tryin' to smoke us all out!	['muthafucka']
Other	7	1	What the hell is goin' on here?	['hell']
Other	39	0	It's called a lock-in at the rec center. We can use all the rec center facilities. We can play basketball, go swimming, or even just kick it in the lounge area with some games and ...p-puzzles.	[]
Other	1	0	Timmih!	[]
Other	32	0	But nobody can leave until it's seven a.m., so if you wanna have a good time, you're all just gonna have to learn to get along.  Theeerrre's pizzaaa.	[]
Other	56	0	Tom, over five years ago, doctors told Christopher Reeve that he would never walk again, but the resilient actor fought back, struggled against all odds, and has now built his very own Legion of Doom!  The once immobile Mr. Reeve's new organization will be committed to world domination and evil. What an inspirational story, Tom.	[]
Other	50	0	I have chosen each member of this elite group of supervillains for their outstanding treachery,  Their desire for world conquest,  and their hatred of all things good!  And I've assembled this group for one purpose! To once and for all find a way to...  get rid of Hack Man!!	[]
Other	7	0	Uhhh, how about domination of the world?	[]
Other	7	0	Yeah. Or uh, death to the infidels?	[]
Other	16	0	Silence! OUR job is to see to it that Hack Man is put out of commission.	[]
Other	13	0	Oh boy, General Disarray, muh maybe we just oughtta stay outta this one.	[]
Other	4	0	Not so fast, Chris!	[]
Other	2	0	Hack Man!	[]
Other	16	0	We just helped pass a ban on stem-cell research. Your fetus-sucking days are over!	[]
Other	2	0	No...  NOOOO!	[]
Other	17	0	And now we're goingn to put you somewhere where you can never touch another fetus again!	[]
Other	5	0	You stupid mofos are dead!	[]
Other	5	0	Make the first shot, punk!	[]
Other	25	2	Hold it! Don't you see? It doesn't matter if we were crippled from birth, or crippled in an accident. We're all brothers.	['crippled', 'crippled']
Other	8	0	Save it, fool! Crips ain't our brothers!	[]
Other	19	0	Look: we hve the whole rec room to ourselves. Can't we all just try having some fun together?	[]
Other	6	0	Yeah, we ain't playin', sucka!	[]
Other	14	0	Why don't we at least give it a chance? I mean,  Come on!	[]
Other	7	0	Wait a minute. What did you say?	[]
Other	6	0	I said, I mean,  Come on!	[]
Other	10	0	You know, maybe he's right. I mean,  Come on!	[]
Other	2	0	Come on.	[]
Other	17	0	I guess we could at least give havin' fun together a try. It's like  Come on.	[]
Other	3	0	Yeah. Come on.	[]
Other	6	0	Yeah, that's right. Come on.	[]
Other	2	0	Come on.	[]
Other	2	0	Come on.	[]
Other	6	0	Yeah, that's right. Come on.	[]
Other	16	0	I've gotta give you two dawgs props for puttin' an end to all this hate.	[]
Other	48	1	I told you, lock-ins at the rec center always work. And you know, I've learned something, too. I was player-hatin' Christopher Butthole Reeve because he got more attention than me. But just like... y-you guys, I need to learn to control my a... anger.	['butthole']
Other	2	0	Right on!	[]
Other	9	1	Hey little Roller, try some of this chronic shit.	['shit']
Other	1	0	Timmih!	[]
Other	30	0	I guess we all learned that trying to get along is way better than p... player hatin'.  The gang wrote a song about it. Why don't we listen in?	[]
Other	41	0	It used to be that Crips and Bloods didn't get along, But now we're all a family, so we wrote this song. Naaa na naaa, Crips and Bloods. Naaa na naaa, hope and love. Naaa na naaa, friendly thugs.	[]
Other	14	0	You haven't seen the last of me, Hack Man! I will be back!!	[]
Stan	11	0	Dude, I am so glad we stayed out of that one.	[]
