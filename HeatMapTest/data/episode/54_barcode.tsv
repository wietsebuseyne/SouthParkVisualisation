Cartman	2	0	Mister Hammerhead?	[]

Mr. Garrison	2	0	No-o!	[]
Cartman	26	1	Why the hell does the FBI keep arresting all my friends? This has to be the work of Stan and Kyle! God, I hate those guys!	['hell']
Kyle	28	0	See? I told you, dude. Those are dialysis machines.  Old people have to hook themselves into it with a tube, and it sucks all their body fluids out.	[]
Stan	5	0	Oh, man, that's terrible.	[]

Stan	7	0	We're making faces at sick people.	[]
Cartman	21	1	No! I mean, what the hell are you doing?! Why are all my mature adult friends being mys-teriously arrested, huh?!	['hell']
Stan	4	0	We don't know.	[]
Cartman	30	0	I'll tell you why! Because you guys are jealous and can't handle the fact that you're immature, and so you've started a government conspiracy against me!	[]
Kyle	10	1	We don't know what you're talking about, lardbutt.	['lardbutt']
Cartman	16	0	Lardbut. Oh, that's so mature! Golly, I guess I was wrong about you guys, huh?!	[]
Stan	8	0	You're not more mature than us, Cartman!	[]
Cartman	3	0	YES I AM!!	[]
Mr. Garrison	12	0	I'm telling you, this is all a terrible mistake, Officer Barbrady.	[]
Other	21	0	Well, the FBI said I have to hold you here, so that's what I'm gonna do, Mr. Complainy Pants.	[]
Mr. Garrison	2	0	O-ogh!	[]
Other	7	0	Do you like having your back rubbed?	[]
Mr. Garrison	3	0	Eat me, pervert!	[]
Other	1	0	Okay.	[]
Other	8	0	We demand you release these men at once!	[]
Other	3	0	Who are you?	[]
Other	20	0	We are NAMBLA, the North American Man Boy Love Association, and we heard about these political prisoners you're keeping?	[]
Other	7	1	Political prisoners? No, these are child molesters.	['molesters']
Other	40	1	Loving young boys has been around since the time of the Romans, pal! There's nothing wrong with it! We are an organization dedicated to showing that sex between a man and a young boy can be a beautiful thing!	['sex']
Other	3	0	Yeah, uh-huh.	[]
Other	21	0	Uuuh, I don't know who you are, but these men aren't going anywhere until I hear from the FBI.	[]
Other	4	0	Hate mongerer! Hate mongerer!	[]
Other	4	0	Hate mongerer! Hate mongerer!	[]
Other	15	0	Okay people , I think you'd better move along before I arrest more of you!	[]
Other	16	0	All these men wanted was to love a young boy!  There is nothing wrong with love!	[]
Mr. Garrison	30	1	I did not want love from a young boy! I like men my own age.  Aah! I mean, I like women! What did I say?-Oh God! I love titties!	['titties']
Other	16	0	You haven't heard the last of us, officer! Together we are strong.  Come on, men!	[]
Other	9	0	Wow, they've got activists for everything these days.	[]
Other	58	0	I've done it, Kevin. I've successfully spliced this chipmunk with a piece of provolone cheese.  Do you know what this means, Kevin? No more will the world have to look in two different places for squirrels and provolone cheese. No more will mankind have to pick-  Who could that be?  Why, it's little Eric Cartman.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Dr. Mephesto, I need help.	[]
Other	5	0	Well of course, come in.	[]
Cartman	38	0	You see, unfortunately I have matured faster than all my friends. I wanna hang out with older friends, but I can't find any, so I was wondering if you could genetically engineer some older friends for me.	[]
Other	25	0	Oh, Eric, I'm afraid it's not that simple. Genetic engineering has not yet evolved to the state where I can just make people.	[]
Cartman	9	1	Damnit! But I wanna hang out with older guys!	['damnit']
Other	19	0	Oh. Well, I happen to be a member of an organization that can help you. It's called, NAMBLA.	[]
Cartman	1	0	NAMBLA?	[]
Other	22	0	Yes. I have been a member for several years. I'm sure they'd let you join. You l-look about right.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Hokay, thanks, Dr. Mephesto!	[]
Other	1	0	Sure!	[]
Other	39	1	Fellow members of NAMBLA. As you know, hn hn, we continue to be discriminated against. Recently, the FBI has started to arrest men, who are doing nothing more than trying to start a sexual relationship with a young boy.	['sexual']
Other	1	0	Awwww.	[]
Other	20	1	And now that all ethnic groups, homosexuals and women's are protected under civil-rights laws,  we want the same!	['homosexuals']
Other	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Other	3	0	Yeh-hehah-hah.	[]
Other	43	0	What we need is proof that young boys want to be members of NAMBLA. That they want love from us. We need a poster child, to show the world that it is a beautiful and wonderful thing and a-  Can we... help you?	[]
Cartman	12	0	Yes. I'd like to join your fine organization. Is that cool?	[]
Other	2	0	You... do?	[]
Cartman	1	0	Sure.	[]
Other	6	0	Oho, thank you. Thank you, Jesus.	[]
Cartman	1	0	...Sweet.	[]
Other	18	0	Well, Kenny, the doctor confirmed it. I'm pregnant! You're gonna have a little brother or sister.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(No!!)	[]
Other	5	0	Yup, it's for sure!	[]
Other	8	0	And he fixed my shattered left testicle, too!	[]
Other	17	0	Don't be out too late, Kenny. We need to start movin' stuff out of your room.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Wow. Your mom's pregnant, Kenny.	[]
Stan	8	0	Yeah. Now what are you going to do?	[]
Kenny	11	0	(I don't know. But I've gotta think of something.)	[]
Cartman	16	0	Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! I got into NAMBLA and you gu-uys didn't!	[]
Kyle	6	0	What are you talking about, fatass?	[]
Cartman	62	0	Oh, no big deal. I just found a group called NAMBLA with adult members, and they all think that I'm sure mature they want me to be their new poster child is all.  It looks like I'm finally gonna have mature friends who I can relate to. Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! I'm too mature for you guys! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah!	[]
Other	6	0	Can I help you, young lady?	[]
Kenny	9	0	(Yes. I'm looking for some morning-after abortion-)	[]
Other	14	0	Oh, you want some morning-after abortion pills. Well, they're right over there.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Thanks.)	[]
Other	26	0	Uh, I'm sorry, young lady, but I can't sell that to you without permission from your parents.  Oh, well, alrighty then. Cash or charge?	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Cash.)	[]
Kenny	8	0	(Look, Mom. I just fixed you a drink.)	[]
Other	16	0	Oh, well that's very sweet of you, Kenny. You made my favorite drink for me.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Here.)	[]
Other	11	0	But unfortunately, now that I'm pregnant, I can't drink.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(What?)	[]
Other	5	0	Well, I can still drink.	[]
Kenny	2	0	(No! Daddy!)	[]
Other	33	1	Ogh, that hits the spot. Makes me forget all about my shattered balls.  What? Wwhat's the matter? Uh, why don't you go make me another one of... of...  Who-o-oa.	['balls']
Other	4	0	What's the matter?	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Uh oh.)	[]
Other	8	1	Oh, God, I'm gonna crap my pants!	['crap']
Other	7	1	Oohhh, God!  Oooh, my balls!  Ooh, God	['balls']
Other	12	0	Just a few more pictures, Eric. You make a perfect poster child.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Thanks, dude.	[]
Other	25	0	Uh hey, Eric, we have a surprise for you. We want to have a big dinner and dance honoring you as our new poster child.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Really? Awesome!	[]
Other	12	0	Yes, and we you to um... invite all your young male friends.	[]
Cartman	18	0	Oh. Well, sure. I have some friends who want to be mature,  excluding Stan and Kyle, of course.	[]
Other	15	0	Great, hnn. You go invite your little friends, and we'll get the hotel ready.	[]
Cartman	2	1	KIIICK ASS!	['ass']
Other	17	0	Kenny?? Don't forget to clean out your room so we can paint it for the baby.	[]
Other	38	0	Hey, are you feeling down? You need some excitement. And North Park Funland has just opened its newest ride! The John Denver Experience!  You'll be Rocky Mountain High with this, the most EXTREME, INSANE RIDE EVER BUILT.	[]
Other	2	0	It was-	[]
Other	1	0	-fun.	[]
Other	1	0	-fun.	[]
Other	19	0	Note: people with heart conditions and expectant mothers should not ride the JOHN DENVER! Open now! Come on down!	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Mom!)	[]
Other	10	0	Are you sure you should be going on this thing?	[]
Other	32	0	Oh, it's all right.  You know, I think maybe Kenny's been a little worried about the new baby. We have to show him that he's still our little boy.	[]
Other	40	0	Folks, please keep your hands and arms inside the John Denver Experience at all times. There's no sense in trying to unloop at the latch at any time during the ride here at the John Denver Experience. Have fun.	[]
Other	7	0	What did he say?  ...John Denver Experience.	[]
Other	10	0	Oh, God, my nose! I think I broke my nose!	[]

Cartman	22	0	Oh, Stan, Kyle, just the guys I wanted to see! My NAMBLA organization is having a very important benefit in my honor.	[]
Kyle	2	0	They are?	[]
Cartman	40	0	We're gonna have a big, mature party at this hotel, and I can invite all my mature friends that I want. And that means I'm gonna invite everybody! Except for you guys! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah!	[]
Stan	11	0	We don't wanna go to some stupid adult meeting anyway!	[]
Cartman	9	0	Well, that's nice, 'cause you can't go.	[]
Kyle	5	0	We don't wanna go!	[]

Other	38	2	Don't touch me! I've had my nuts broken, body poisoned, have been made love to in the ass by three dozen 40-year-old men-I just wanna go home and take a, a hot bath!	['nuts', 'ass']
Other	15	0	We've been after you for a long time, buddy! Do you know your rights?	[]
Other	89	0	Rights? Does anybody know their rights? You see, I've learned something today.  Our forefathers came to this country because... they believed in an idea. An idea called freedom. They wanted to live in a place where a group couldn't be prosecuted for their beliefs. Where a person can live the way he chooses to live.  You see us as being perverted because we're different from you. People are afraid of us, because they don't understand. And sometimes it's easier to persecute than to understand.	[]
Kyle	6	1	Dude. You have sex with children.	['sex']
Other	49	0	We are human. Most of us didn't even choose to be attracted to young boys. We were born that way. We can't help the way we are, and if you all can't understand that, well, then, I guess you'll just have to put us away.	[]
Kyle	6	1	Dude. You have sex with children.	['sex']
Stan	20	2	Yeah. You know, we believe in equality for everybody, and tolerance, and all that gay stuff, but dude, fuck you.	['gay', 'fuck']
Kyle	1	0	Seriously.	[]
Other	16	0	Alright, that's enough. You're all going to be put away for a long time.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Well, Cartman	[]
Cartman	2	0	Well, what?	[]
Kyle	13	0	Don't you think you owe everyone an apology for bringing NAMBLA here?	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Cartman	13	1	Alright, alright, I'm sorry I almost got you guys all raped. There.	['raped']
Stan	16	0	And now, do you still think that you need to hang out with older, mature friends?	[]
Cartman	16	0	No, I guess you guys will blossom into maturity someday. Just don't take too long.	[]
Other	4	0	Okay, let's roll.	[]
Other	4	0	Dr. Flores, dial 18-	[]
Other	6	0	Coo, cootchy-coo, coohoohoohoo, cootchy-coo.	[]
Other	4	0	Our little angel, yes.	[]
Other	28	0	Oh, he's so beautiful. I know it's been hard on both of us losing poor Kenny. But this new baby kind of reminds me of him.	[]
Other	5	0	What should we name him?	[]
Other	14	0	Well, seeing as though Kenny passed away, maybe we should name him ah,... Kenny.	[]
Other	19	0	Yes. Kenny's such a great name. My little Kenny, a brand-new Kenny. (The new Kenny then mumbles)	[]
Other	10	0	God, this must be the fiftieth time this has happened.	[]
Other	2	0	Fifty-second.	[]
