Cartman	11	0	The men are just inexperience, Sir Kyle. They need more training.	[]
Kyle	21	0	It's not enough! Ever since Kenny switched sides, there are more kids that wanna go with PS4 on Black Friday.	[]

Other	15	0	...but, this one kid said that he's a wizard, and that Sony is helping-	[]
Other	25	0	Guys, guys guys! It's just a video game machine, alright? Microsoft's a company that... tries to be above all the petty commercialism, okay?	[]

Cartman	13	0	Paladin Butters, I was hoping I could talk to you about Lady McCormick	[]
Butters	6	0	You mean Princess Kenny, m'lord?	[]

Butters	3	0	They don't!	[]
Cartman	11	0	Well did you finish watching Season 3 like I asked you?	[]
Butters	4	0	Yeah, I finished it!	[]
Cartman	8	0	So what happens when the dragons show up?	[]
Butters	24	0	Nothing! The dragons are just still on their way! They keep promising dragons, but all I get are more floppy wieners in my face!	[]
Cartman	32	0	Butter-Butters! The key to our victory is following the_Game of Thrones_model exactly. I have to know what happens when the dragons show up so I know how to deal with Kenny.	[]
Butters	6	0	Wha-what do you want_me_to do?	[]
Cartman	26	0	Here's two bus tickets to New Mexico. I want you to take Sir Scott Malkinson and go seek out George R. R. Martin for answers.	[]
Butters	6	0	Who's George R. R. Martin?	[]
Cartman	53	0	He's the guy who writes_Game of Thrones, Butters! He can let us both know how to handle Kenny, and if we should betray Clyde or not. Let's face it, Butters, this is really about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors.	[]

Other	2	0	Uh huh.	[]
Other	16	0	You know, I think we'll ultimately sell the number of unites we want to._	[]
Other	86	1	You're right, Steve. Some changes_do_need to be made.__Do yo know what weakness is, Steve? Weakness is believing that competition is healthy. See, there was a time when XBoxes and PlayStations could both survive in this world, but that time's done. It's all headed to one device that people game on, watch TV on, socialize on. There's only going to be one winner. I can't have you idiots throwing away everything I worked so hard to achieve.__Clean that shit up.	['shit']
Butters	7	0	Well come on, Scott. You're lagging.	[]
Other	10	0	I think my insulin's low. I need to eat.	[]

Butters	4	0	We're not fans!	[]
Other	6	0	Yeah, we don't like it!	[]
Butters	17	0	We don't like it! And I'm pretty pissed off, if you wanna know the truth!	[]
Other	2	0	About what?	[]
Butters	16	0	Let me talk to George R. R. Martin, and I'll tell him about what!_	[]
Other	15	0	It's the Red Wedding, isn't it? You hate how I killed everyone off?	[]
Butters	19	0	Uh no sir, we just really need to know about the dragons, but they never seem to show up.	[]
Other	10	0	Oh they're coming. The dragons are on their way.	[]
Butters	1	0	When?	[]
Other	4	0	You really wanna know?	[]
Butters	4	0	Please. It's urgent.	[]
Other	42	0	Alright, King Joffrey is still at King's Landing, but there's a young blacksmith who wakes up one morning with a plan. And His wiener gently hangs down between his legs. Soft and flaccid, his wiener glistened in the golden sunlight.	[]
Butters	14	0	No, uhno, can we skip the wiener stuff and just get to the dragons?	[]
Other	13	1	Aw shit, I think I'm-I think I'm going to faint.	['shit']
Butters	6	0	Uh what's the matter, Scott?	[]

Other	16	0	Come on in! I'll tell you everything that's gonna happen in_Game of Thrones._	[]
Cartman	10	0	Sir Kyle, I wanted to talk to you about Stan.	[]
Kyle	21	0	If you want to make sure I'm not switching sides, Cartman, you don't have to worry. Stan is wrong.	[]
Cartman	40	1	It isn't that. Princess Kenny is loved by her army_, but Stan is still the nuts and ball of her operation.__It would be a huge setback to the traitors getting their PlayStations if Stan were to be...__grounded?	['nuts']
Kyle	3	0	Grounded? For what?	[]
Cartman	6	0	That could be up to you.	[]
Kyle	15	0	No, Cartman. You said nobody will have to be grounded. We're not playing dirty!	[]
Cartman	22	0	Fine, Sir Kyle. Perhaps you're right.__Did you know that Stan's dad is working a temp job as mall security?	[]
Kyle	1	0	What?	[]
Cartman	51	0	Seems a little convenient, doesn't it?__Stan with somebody on the inside to help him get his PS4s. Who's playing dirty now? Let's face it, Sir Kyle, this is really about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors.	[]
Other	12	0	Don't believe it!__He said that to a bunch of people!	[]
Cartman	13	0	Dude, you'd better stop harassing me or I'm callin' the cops!	[]
Other	5	0	You're callin' the cops?!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Other	10	0	You're on my property!_I'm callin' the cops!	[]
Cartman	8	1	Well go ahead! Call the fuckin' cops then!	['fuckin']

Other	16	0	Tom, I'm standing in your doorway because we have a hot news story to report.	[]
Other	9	0	We don't go to work for another hour.	[]
Other	24	0	We just got a call from Bill Gates.__He says he can promise us a bigger war on Black Friday if we play along.	[]
Other	7	0	He wants us to side with him?	[]
Other	29	0	That's right, Tammy. Let's not forget that having a bloodbath on Black Friday is good for the news. It's good for us. The bigger, the better.	[]
Other	12	0	Our job is to report the news, not make it more violent!	[]
Other	31	0	Right, Tom. Because you're sooo about integrity. Let's go.__Or maybe I should let everyone in the newsroom know what their two anchors are up to! Back to you!	[]
Other	18	0	It's the morning news, with Tom and Tammy Thompson. Colorado's top-rated brother-sister news team.	[]
Other	16	0	Well Black Friday is just around the corner and Tammy, it's getting fierce out there.	[]
Other	16	0	That's right, and Niles Lawson is out at the mall with a little holiday surprise.	[]
Other	26	0	Tammy, the excitement over Black Friday is peaking, and none other than Bill Gates himself has shown up to try to make it even bigger._	[]
Other	47	0	That's right. We just wanna do whatever we can to help our supporters get their XBoxes at incredible deals on Friday, so we've come to offer swords and battle axes, whatever the kids can carry to help them fight their way through the other shoppers.	[]
Other	13	0	We understand that you've donated some guns to the kids as well.	[]
Other	24	0	Yes, but we are limiting it to one per XBox follower,, because of course, the key thing here on everyone's mind is safety.	[]
Other	1	0	Yes?	[]
Cartman	4	0	Hi, is Kenny home?	[]
Other	10	0	Uh, yeah, Kenny's out back playing with his friends.	[]
Cartman	12	0	Forward, men!__That, no-__No, you- You've gotta turn me._	[]
Other	12	0	It's the enemy! Defensive po-po-p-po-p-positions!_	[]
Other	9	0	Protect the Princess! Kill 'em! Kill 'em! Get out!	[]
Cartman	8	0	I seek audience with the traitor, Lady McCormick?	[]
Stan	4	0	Let them pass!__	[]
Kenny	10	0	(Welcome to my kingdom, Sir Eric. Now, state your purpose.)	[]
Stan	16	2	The Princess bids your fat ass welcome to her kingdom and suggests you state your purpose.	['fat', 'ass']
Cartman	27	0	You can't win this, guys. Look around you. Lay down your weapons, and you can come back and fight for XBoxes with us on Black Friday.	[]
Kenny	11	0	(You can change your mind instead of fighting with us, Eric.)	[]
Stan	20	0	The Princess says that if you wanna change your mind and agree that Playstations are better, she'll consider it.	[]
Cartman	25	0	Kenny, we all understand wanting to play as the chick once in a while, 'kay? But you are never going to be a real princess!	[]
Kenny	13	2	(What?!)_ (Oh, the nerve! How insensitive of you, you cock-sucking faggot!)	['cock', 'faggot']
Stan	8	0	The Princess calls you a ball-licking lesbian.	[]
Cartman	6	0	That doesn't even make sense.	[]
Kyle	20	0	Stan, this has gone too far. People are going to get hurt. What you started is way out of control.	[]
Stan	4	0	What_I_started? How dare you!	[]
Kyle	22	0	All these people are going to be gaming on XBox. You really wanna just game with Craig the rest of your life?	[]
Stan	30	0	I would rather game with Craig than spend one minute having to set up an XBox Live account! We will get our PlayStations tomorrow, and you buttholes will have nothing!	[]
Cartman	17	0	You're outnumbered ten to one, and there's no time left! How will you win?!_	[]
Stan	7	0	The gods will find us a way!	[]
Other	55	0	So then Samwell Tarly sees the army approaching, and his wiener is about this big.__He knows that Stannis Baratheon's wiener is probably shriveled from the cold. Samwell has to rally his men, so what does he do? He takes out his wiener__and he dangles it around for all his men to see._	[]

Butters	8	0	OOAH! Uh, sir, you said pizzas were coming!	[]

Butters	13	0	But you said they were on their way like three hours ago!_	[]

Other	41	0	Don't worry. They're coming. Pizzas are on their way. They're gonna be amazing.__Now, John Snow finally faces Jaime Lannister, and this guy's wiener is, you know, huge, right? So it's not goin' to be easy.	[]
Other	1	0	Ehhh...	[]
Cartman	15	0	Mr. Gates, I was hoping I could talk to you about the fight on Friday.	[]
Other	4	0	Certainly. Uh, Eric, right?	[]
Cartman	42	0	Uhh, it's my Lord Wizard King, actually. Having your leadership has certainly been a help.__But I hope that we're clear that this is my army.__There can only be one person of royalty; that's kind of the rules.	[]
Other	25	0	Oh I certainly don't wanna step on your toes. Don't worry, I'm quite good at letting my CEOs do what they want.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Your CEOs?	[]
Other	26	0	Let's face it, this is really just about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors.	[]

Other	11	1	That was amazing sex. I enjoyed it immensely. How about you?	['sex']
Other	6	0	Tanoshikatta ne. (Yeah, it was fun.)	[]
Other	27	0	You know, Microsoft has given kids who want XBoxes on Black Friday a lot of support. Seems a shame that the fight will be so one-sided.	[]
Other	9	0	Eh? Nani kore, tsukareta yo. (What? I'm tired!)	[]
Other	40	0	Black Friday is about to happen and it's not even gonna be a fight. That's bad for both of us. There must be something you can give to kids who want Sonys to make the fight more even.	[]
