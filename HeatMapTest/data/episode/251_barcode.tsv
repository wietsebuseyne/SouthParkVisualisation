Other	5	0	A Handicar? What's that?	[]
Other	5	0	You don't use Handicar?	[]
Other	24	0	No, see, you just get the Handicar app. It uses GPS to locate where you are, and the Handicar comes and picks you up.	[]
Other	1	0	Wow...	[]
Other	27	0	Yeah, and it's cheaper than a taxi. I'm telling you, it's the future of transportation. Oh, here it comes.  Honey, our Handicar is here.	[]

Other	2	0	No thanks.	[]
Other	10	0	Only a few more guitar licks left in Rocktober, guys.	[]
Other	5	0	We're good. Shut up!	[]
Other	5	0	Oh, here's our Handicar.	[]
Other	1	0	Timmy.	[]
Other	2	1	The fuck?	['fuck']
Other	41	0	All right, kids, you know what time of year this is?  That's right, it's autumn! And that means our fundraising for next year's summer camp is in full gear. Is everyone psyched for next year's summer camp?	[]

Other	1	0	Yeeaahhh!	[]
Other	12	0	Francis has raised $29.32  And Timmy has raised $2,063.00!	[]
Other	1	0	Timmy!	[]
Other	19	0	All righty, if you guys keep this up, we'll raise the money for summer camp in no time!	[]
Other	16	0	I won't do it, Mimsy. I won't spend another summer at that stupid camp.	[]
Other	8	0	D'awww, we don't like camp, boss?	[]
Other	14	0	We hate camp, Mimsy. The singing, the competitions, Jimmy Valmer getting all the chicks.	[]
Other	18	1	D'oh yeah and don't forget last year at summer camp, you got raped by a shark.	['raped']
Other	32	1	Shut up, Mimsyyyy! I'm not gonna spend my summer trapped at that camp with these punch-happy assholes. We gotta find a way to put Handicar out of business, and fast.	['assholes']
Other	13	0	D'ah oh boy! We're gonna wreck Timmy's business, huh boss?	[]
Other	2	0	Shh-shh.	[]
Other	9	0	Hey boys, are you excited for camp next year?	[]
Other	9	0	Yes, Counselor Steve. We like the tug-of-waaarr.	[]
Other	9	0	All right. Well, just keep working on those donations.	[]
Other	18	0	Come on, Mimsy, we gotta figure out how we're gonna make Handicar a thing of the past.	[]
Other	3	0	D'oh boy!	[]
Other	33	0	We are united as brothers, because jast as Handicar has taken away jobs from honest, hard-working cab drivers, it's also taken food  from the mouths of the children of car salesmen!	[]
Other	7	0	Well I don't have any children.	[]
Other	14	0	Who does this handicapped boy think he is?! He's not even in union!	[]
Other	12	0	He's taking all our business because people find it more coomvenient.	[]
Other	22	0	Aaand, because he's handicapped, he can use special access points and parking spaces. That kid was born with an unfair advantage!	[]
Other	4	0	Who is this rat?!	[]
Other	23	0	His name is Timmy Burch.  And if you don't do something quick, you're all gonna be out of work for good.	[]
Other	3	0	Who are you?!	[]
Other	18	0	Just someone who doesn't like to see hard workers like yourselves lose their jobs. That's all.	[]
Other	21	0	Nobody takes jobs away from US! We need to speak to Mayor and tell her to shut down this illegitimate business!	[]
Other	10	0	Or maybe we can have the police shut him down!	[]
Other	37	0	Hey I got an idea! Why don't you guys just make your cars cleaner and nicer, and try to be better to your customers so that you can compete with Handicar's popularity in the marketplace?	[]
Other	8	0	Just ignore my friend. He's mentally disabled.	[]
Other	6	0	Aw yeah, don't mind me.	[]
Other	24	0	Now listen, everybody. If you're a sheepherder, and there's a snake taking away your sheep, what do you do to the snake?	[]
Other	9	0	Offer it last year's Christmas in Rocksummer prizes?	[]
Other	8	1	No, you fucking moron! You kill... the snake!	['fucking']
Other	6	0	Hey wake up, you little scab!	[]
Other	3	0	Tutih Tuh-Timmih?	[]
Other	9	0	We got a message for ya! From the union.	[]
Other	34	0	Just imagine it, Mimsy. A whole summer to ourselves to do what we want. It's going to be awesome.  Well well, hello gentlemen. I understand you've taken care of our little problem?	[]
Other	4	0	Yeah, we sure did!	[]
Other	11	0	Let's just say he'll be laid up a while.	[]
Other	13	0	Yeah. We snuck in his room last night and we... broke his legs!	[]
Other	8	0	Oh boy, that's great-wait, you what??	[]
Other	1	0	Timmy!	[]
Randy	6	0	I am Lorde. Lawdy Lawdy Lorde.	[]
Other	8	0	But we broke his legs. Both of them.	[]
Other	24	2	Let me give you guys a hot news flash: If you want to hurt a crippled kid, you don't break his FUCKING LEGS!	['crippled', 'fucking']
Other	7	0	How can people be so ineffectual, Mimsy?	[]
Other	7	0	D'uh I don't know, boss.	[]
Other	11	0	These are supposed to be men who care about their occupations.	[]
Other	38	0	D'uh maybe if they're that incompetent we shouldn't be tryin' to save their jobs. Maybe Handicar is a kind of economic natural selection, where the more diligent workers are weeding out the useless ones. Drrrrr.	[]
Other	3	0	Shut up, Mimsyyyy!	[]
Other	16	0	Right here is good.  Thank you. I can just use the app to tip you, right?	[]
Other	1	0	Timmy!	[]
Other	7	0	Ohohh, this is so handy!  Thank you!	[]
Other	3	0	Timmy.  Tiiimmih Timmih.	[]
Other	9	0	Hey Timmy, it's your friend from camp, Nathan.	[]
Other	1	0	Timmih!	[]
Other	23	0	Listen, you can't possibly handle all this business you're getting. Admit it. You've got more customers than you can handle.	[]
Other	1	0	Timmih.	[]
Other	31	0	I've got an amazing idea. Why don't you let other people drive Handicars too? Think of all the money you could raise for camp if you expand your business.	[]
Other	2	0	Hmmm, Timmih.	[]
Other	11	0	I'm sure you could find a lot of interested drivers.	[]
Other	1	0	Timmy!	[]
Other	14	1	That's great. Summer camp, here we come.  Now kiss your business goodbye, asshole!	['asshole']
Other	21	0	D'ah I don't get it boss. I thought you hated Handicar. How come now you wanna work for 'em?	[]
Other	20	1	It's very simple, Mimsy. I'm gonna take down Handicar by being an employee who sexually harasses the passengers.	['sexually']
Other	5	1	D'ahhh, sexual harassment, boss?	['sexual']
Other	43	1	It's simple. If you're a sheepherder and a snake is killing your sheep, you just need to have the snake get sued for sexual misconduct. Now, you find me a female passenger on that app and leave the rest to me.	['sexual']
Other	4	0	D'ah oh boy!	[]
Other	25	1	Timmy. Hello ma'am. Handicar at your service. Climb on in.  So, let me ask you a question. Would you like to see my dick?	['dick']
Other	7	0	Sure. Would you like to see mine?	[]
Other	2	0	Uh oh!	[]
Other	11	0	Mimsy! Hel- help, Mimsy!  And I thought a shark was bad.	[]
Other	11	0	Come on, honey. It says our Handicar is just pulling up.	[]
Other	5	0	Timmy! Oh hi, Gerald, Sheila.	[]
Other	5	0	Stephen, what are you doing?	[]
Other	59	0	You didn't know? Anyone can be a Handicar driver now. All you have to do is get your own wheelchair and you can earn a Handicap. I've had my Handicap for about three days now. Get on in.  I'm telling you Gerald, havin' a Handicar is a grat way to make some money on the side.	[]
Other	1	0	Timmy!	[]
Other	1	0	Timmy!	[]
Other	1	0	Timmy!	[]
Other	8	0	The world of transportation is really changing, Gerald.	[]
Other	12	0	D'aww gee, your idea to have Handicar expand really worked, boss.	[]
Other	11	0	'Scuse me, out of my way, please. I have a Handicap.	[]
Other	12	0	I had a handicap way before you got paid to have one!	[]
Other	22	0	D'ahhh, you sound like that Matthew McConaughey guy. Ah I drove a Lincoln before I got paid to drive one. Drrrr.	[]
Other	3	0	Shut up Mimsyyy!	[]
Other	28	0	For the pat eight years Tesla has been the leading innovator in the world of automotive transport. And now the President and CEO of Tesla Motorcars, Elon Musk.	[]
Other	23	0	Today I am proud to annouce the Tesla D, the most innovative and efficient world-friendly mode of transportation ever created. Any questions?	[]
Other	5	0	Yes, ahh, what about Handicar?	[]
Other	3	0	What about it?!	[]
Other	25	0	Well all over the country prople are realzing that using an app to ride-share is even more convenient and eco-friendly than electric cars.	[]
Other	12	0	How do you intend to compete with this boy genius in Colorado?	[]
Other	21	0	I am so sick of hearing about app-based ride-sharing! The future of transportation is the electric cars, not wheelchairs!	[]
Other	10	0	Don't worry, Elon. Handicar is just a small company.	[]
Other	37	0	Oh sure, operating in a few small towns, but when they start absorbing the taxi markets, bringing taxi sservice to any part of the world, driving your kids to and from school, delivering both people and things?	[]
Other	12	1	We can't compete with Handicar! It's just so damned handy!	['damned']
Other	26	0	If there is a way to reduce Handicar's positive publicity, then we need to do it now!  And you! You say it's theoretically possible?	[]
Other	27	0	Of course. It's very simple. If you're a sheepherder, and a snake is killing all your sheep, how do you get rid of the snake?	[]
Other	4	0	Who's the sheepherder?	[]
Other	2	0	You are.	[]
Other	4	0	Who's the snake?	[]
Other	1	0	Handicar.	[]
Other	6	1	D'ah, it's an analogy.	['analogy']
Other	33	0	Shut up Mimsyyy!  If you're a sheepherder, and a snake is killing your sheep, all you have to do is prove to the sheep that the snake is a completely inferior entity.	[]
Other	1	0	Timmy!	[]
Other	1	0	Timmy!	[]
Other	9	0	Hey Timmy. How is the fundraising for camp going?	[]
Other	1	0	Timmih!	[]
Other	27	0	That's great. I can't wait for camp this year.  We are doing some fundraising too. Have you heard of my friend Elon Musk from Tesla?	[]
Other	4	0	Good day to you!	[]
Other	1	0	Timmih!	[]
Other	22	0	Hey, how would you like to have a friendly little race? It would be great publicity for your fundraising and for ours.	[]
Other	13	0	D'ah we're gonna get Timmy killed in the race, huh boss?	[]
Other	3	0	Shut up, Mimsy!	[]
Other	15	0	Whattaya say, Timmy? A friendly race this Saturday? We'll see you at 9am sharp.	[]
Other	7	0	Hey everyone, you need to see this!	[]
Other	57	0	What started as a simple contest is quickly escalating into an international crisis. As electronic cars challenge the oil industry, and transportation alternatives fight for dominance, the unavoidable outcome may be a conflict the likes the world has not seen since the '70s. It appears that the world is once again on the brink  of Wacky Races.	[]
Randy	4	1	Wacky Races?! Holy shit!	['shit']
Other	103	1	The prime minister of Japan (Shinzo Abe is shown) insisted that any race would break the Treaty of Salzburg, which called for a cease-fire to the Wacky Races for their senseless brutality. They also claim that if a race does take place, they would have no choice but to enter their completely self-driven prototype Lexus into the conflict. The Canadians and Chinese are also saying they would be forced to race, and no one yet has heard from Dick Dastardly or Muttley. Unless a miracle happens, this Saturday morning the world will witness the fist Wacky Races in nearly 50 years.	['dick']
Other	17	0	Wacky Races oh God! Wacky Races oh my God! Oh my God Wacky Races oh my God!	[]
Other	9	0	Randy, they're bringin' back Wacky Races Saturday monring!	[]
Randy	8	0	I know! Are we watching at your house?!	[]
Other	9	0	That's it, everyone! We're out of cereal!	[]
Other	10	0	No! I didn't get any! That guy has two!	[]
Other	8	0	There's none left, don't you understand?!	[]
Other	22	0	Don't you see what they're doing? This is just another example of corporations trying to keep down people with handicaps!	[]
Other	12	0	Don't do the race. You don't have to prove anything.	[]
Other	32	0	He HAS to do it, don't you see? He has people that are depending on him to raise as much money as possible. There are hundreds of people with handicaps now.	[]
Other	1	0	Timmih...	[]
Other	45	0	But isn't that the problem? I mean, let's face it, it's not like he's able to keep the driver quality up. Anyone can have a Handicap now. I mean, even Matthew McConaughey is a Handicar driver now, for Chrit's sake!	[]
Other	20	0	Hey.  I was drivin' a Handicar... way before I got paid to drive one. I just like how it feels.	[]
Other	41	0	Look, the point is that this is your opportunity to make Handicar- oops, sorry.  Hold on, sorry, went too far.  This is your opportunity to make Handicar thee transportation of thte future. Think what you could do with all that money.	[]
Other	184	2	And here they are, the most daredevil group of shared-ride drivers ever to whirl their wheels in the Wacky Races, competing for the title of the future of transportation. Cars are apporoaching the starting line. First off is the Lyft car , a ride-sharing company out of San Francisco. next up is the ZipCar, a pay-by-the-hour concept based on Chinese bicycles. Maneuvering for position is the standard taxicab driven by an angry Russian. Right behind is the Hummer salesman in his 2014 Hummer No Class. And there's ingenious inventor Elon Musk in his new Tesla D. Oh, and here's the lovely Canadian actress Neve Campbell in the Canadian conept vehicle The Queef, powered completely on female natural gas.  Next we have the Handicar with Timmy Burch. And there's the completely automated self-driving car from Japan. Limping along last are those double-dealing do-badders Dick Dasterdly and his sidekick Muttley.  And away they go on the way out Wacky Races.  And this live coverage of the event will be braodcast all morning, of course, on CNN.	['queef', 'dick']
Other	4	0	Jesus. It's begun.	[]
Other	4	0	God help them all.	[]
Randy	23	0	All I know is... if Dastardly and Muttley are up to their old tricks, there's gonna be a lot of violence today.	[]
Other	5	0	You are watching BBC World.	[]
Other	30	0	The vioent conflict over transport is underway, and it is even more senseless and vile than many remember. We return you now to our live coverage of.. the Wacky Races.	[]
Other	23	0	As the Wacky Raccers roll down the roadway, we see that the taxicab in in the lead, with Handicar pulling up the rear.	[]
Other	1	0	Timmih!	[]
Other	107	0	All the cars must follow the same route. First they'll leave the town of South Park, then navigate through Giggling Gulch on the final stretch to pick up the passenger, a Miss Dotty Applegate. Once the passenger is picked up, the vehicle must successfully deliver her to the destination point at her daughter's house in Morrison.  It looks like the ZipCar is trying to vie for position past the Hummer vehicle. It's neck and neck as the Wacky Racers all push to be first to pick up the passenger.  Miss Applegate is waiting patiently.  And Elon Musk's Tesla appears to take the lead.	[]
Other	13	0	Slow down. I need Timmy to pick up the passenger before we do.	[]
Other	10	0	But I though we wanted Handicar to lose the race!	[]
Other	35	0	He can't just lose the race, he has to get sued and lose the whole business. That's why when he picks up the passemger, I've got a little surprise waiting for him.	[]
Other	67	0	D'ah hey boss, it seems like every time you come up with a plan it kind of backfires on ya. If you really don't wanna go to summer camp so bad, why don't you just tell your parents how you feel?  You know, tell 'em you don't wanna go and just see how they react.  Wait wait, I got it.  Shut up, Mimsy!	[]
Other	2	0	Hey Mimsy.	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah?	[]
Other	2	0	Shut up!	[]
Other	21	0	The Canadian car overtakes the self-driving car. And now here comes the ZipCar, which is being driven by Matthew McConaughey.	[]
Other	13	0	I was drivin' a ZipCar... way before I got paid to drive one.	[]
Other	63	0	And look at this! The Lyft car is the first to arrive and pick up the passenger.  Now the Lyft car must take the passenger to her destination, but look at this! The Hummer salesman is running the Lyft car off the road! And the Hummer salesman is taking the passenger to the car and he is gong to let her drive herself!	[]
Other	29	0	You've got a fully automated sound system and your sunroof is operated right here. What do you think? Huh? Can you see yourself in one of these puppies?	[]
Other	18	0	Elon Musk is using one of his kooky inventions to put the Hummer out of commission for good.	[]
Other	1	0	Wow.	[]
Randy	1	0	Geez!	[]
Other	1	0	God.	[]
Randy	5	0	Did you see that?! Oh!	[]
Other	78	1	The passenger is being taken to the Tesla D now.  No way! She just got snatched by the pissed off Russian in his taxi. Miss Applegate is now in the back of the taxi and she's being forced to watch Jimmy Fallon.  Uh oh, the Canadian car has completely run out of queefs.  With the race neearly over, it's taxi out in front followed by self-driving car, and then pulling up in third is Handicar!	['queefs']
Other	1	0	Timmih!	[]
Other	7	0	It's gonna be a close one!	[]
Other	4	0	Not too close, Boopsie!	[]
Other	11	1	Oh no, Dick Dastardly is up to no-do-goodery again.	['dick']
Randy	3	0	Ohh! Ohh! Duuude!	[]
Other	3	0	Oh no! Ohh!	[]
Other	6	0	Oh no, I can't watch!	[]
Randy	2	0	Oooo! Booom!	[]
Other	1	0	Ohohohh!	[]
Other	3	0	Nice! Oh yeah!	[]
Other	9	0	And there's Handicar to pick Miss Applegate up.	[]
Other	27	2	That's it! Handicar has the passenger! We're almost in range! Another hundred feet!  Wait a minute. What the hell are all those cars?  Holy shit!	['hell', 'shit']
Other	2	0	Timmy! Timmy!	[]
Other	1	0	Aaaaaah!	[]
Other	1	0	Timmy!	[]
Other	28	0	We're near the finish line; the race is almost over. Handicar is in the lead, still way out in front of the ZipCar driven by Matthew McConaughey.	[]
Other	17	0	Sometimes you gotta go forward by goin' backward. Are we drivin' cars or are cars... drivin' us?	[]
Other	12	0	Dastardly car is racing past both.  This could be an upset, folks.	[]
Other	1	0	Timmih!	[]
Other	18	1	Goodnight, you son of a bitch!  Mimsy! I told you to put the explosives under Timmy's seat!	['bitch']
Other	21	1	D'ahh you told me to put the explosives under the seat of that fake soft-spoken douchebag that everyone loves!	['douchebag']
Other	9	1	Not that fake soft-spoken douchebag that everyone loves!	['douchebag']
Other	16	0	Oh my, it appears that an explosion has opend up a wormhole with Matthew McConaughey inside.	[]
Other	1	0	Mimsy!	[]
Other	12	0	And there's the finish. It looks like Handicar has done it!	[]
Other	1	0	Timmih!	[]
Other	41	0	A big congratulations to our fundraising champion! After selling the Handicar rights to Elon Musk, Timmy has raised 2.3 billion dollars for summer camp.  Great job to all of you. This is sure to be the best summer camp ever!	[]
Other	5	0	All set for bed, honey?	[]
Other	7	0	Yeah I like to sleep at nighttime.	[]
Other	3	0	All right, goodnight.	[]
Other	6	0	Wait!  Wait, Mom? Can we talk?	[]
Other	5	0	Um... yes, o-of course.	[]
Other	32	0	This is very difficult, Mom. But um... You know how every year I go to summer camp? Well, I hate it. I hate it and I don't want to go anymore.	[]
Other	12	0	I'm sorry, I can't understand you honey. You're handicapped.	[]
Other	17	0	What's to understand? I'm telling you I don't want to that stupid camp anymore!	[]
Other	8	0	You want water? Is that what you want?	[]
Other	8	0	No! I don't wanna go to camp!	[]
