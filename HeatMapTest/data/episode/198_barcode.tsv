Cartman	1	0	KFC!!	[]
Cartman	15	0	Oh boy oh boy! I'm gonna get a three piece meal and crispy strips!	[]
Kyle	20	0	Cartman, you only come to soccer practice on Fridays, and that's only because we have Kentucky Fried Chicken afterwards!	[]
Cartman	51	4	Shut up you shifty Jew! I'll fuckin' kill you!  Uh sorry, sorry. I just, you know, when I've been waiting too long for the Colonel's chicken I get easily agitated. You're a fuckin' asshole Kenny! Oh oh oh, sorry sorry. Oh here we are! Here we are!	['jew', 'fuckin', 'fuckin', 'asshole']
Stan	4	0	Hey it looks different.	[]
Randy	8	0	Hey uh, what's up with the KFC?	[]
Other	13	0	Oh, it's not a KFC anymore. It's a medicinal marijuana dispensary.	[]
Stan	2	0	A what?	[]
Cartman	7	2	Dude, what the fuck? What the fuck?!	['fuck', 'fuck']
Kyle	6	0	So where's the KFC now?	[]
Randy	12	0	Alright boys, wait out here. Let me see what's going on.	[]
Other	5	0	Can I help you sir?	[]
Randy	9	0	Yeah, we were actually looking to get some KFC?	[]
Other	11	0	Oh yeah sorry, that's gone. We only sell marijuana here.	[]
Randy	10	0	Really? I mean, you're openly selling pot? For reals?	[]
Other	8	0	Sure. New state laws say it's okay.	[]
Randy	31	0	Woohoo, all right! I love the future! Let's see uh, I'll take half a pound of that uhhh Jamaican Passion  and give me some of that purplish stuff too!	[]
Other	11	0	Alright. I'll just need to see your physician's reference.	[]
Randy	2	0	My huh?	[]
Other	23	0	Well, sir we, just can't, sell the marijuana to anybody. You need a reference from your doctor to show it's necessary.	[]
Randy	14	0	Ohhh, that's dumb. Okay. Okay, I'll be I'll be right back!	[]
Stan	4	0	What'd they say?	[]
Randy	5	0	KFC's gone, been replaced.	[]

Stan	7	0	The doctor? But Dad, we wanna eat.	[]
Randy	6	0	I gotta get to the doctor!	[]
Kyle	3	0	...so no KFC?	[]
Cartman	14	0	This is a nightmare. This is a nightmare and I CAN'T WAKE UP!	[]
Other	22	0	Well Mr. Marsh, it looks like you are in prefect health. Your bloodwork came back great and all your vitals appear normal.	[]
Randy	2	0	All right!	[]
Other	5	0	Yep, you check out fine.	[]
Randy	11	0	That's great. So can I get a referral from you?	[]
Other	2	0	For what?	[]
Randy	24	0	Medicinal marijuana.  There's a shop that opened in the old KFC, and they said I needed a doctor's referral to buy weed.	[]
Other	9	0	Mr. Marsh, you don't qualify for medicinal marijuana.	[]
Randy	7	0	But you said I'm totally healthy!	[]
Other	33	0	Medicinal marijuana is for people who aren't healthy. AIDS patients, cancer patients. You know, people going through chemo. The THC helps them eat and take the pain. You are in fine shape!	[]
Randy	12	0	...Well that sucks!  Well so doctor, how do most people get cancer?	[]
Other	11	0	Well there's a lot of ways you can get cancer.	[]
Randy	7	0	Yeah, but what's the quickest way?	[]
Other	2	0	The what?	[]
Randy	18	0	Well like, what forms of cancer induce in time for the Ziggy Marley concert next Saturday in Denver?	[]
Cartman	3	0	Mom, drive faster!	[]
Other	12	0	The KFC in Salida is a long way away, sweetie. Be patient.	[]
Cartman	14	0	Shut up and drive faster! I've been waiting for chicken for TOO LONG!	[]
Other	18	0	Eric, we're almost to Frisco. Why don't we go to the Church's Fried Chicken there?	[]
Cartman	9	1	WHAT?? Church's Fried Chicken tastes like cat shit!	['shit']
Other	7	0	Alright honey, let's take it easy.	[]
Cartman	2	1	Fuck you!	['fuck']
Cartman	8	0	No! No, what's going on?!  Move aside!	[]
Other	9	0	It's closed, kid, there's nothin' in there.	[]
Cartman	15	0	No you, you can't do this! The KFC in my town is closed too!	[]
Other	18	0	Yeah, well, that's because of the vote last November to ban fast food in low-income areas.	[]
Cartman	14	0	You mean I have to drive all the way to Denver to get chicken?!	[]
Other	25	0	No you don't get it, kid. KFCs were only in low-income areas. In the entire state of Colorado, Kentucky Fried Chicken is illegal.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Nooooooooo-!	[]
Stan	10	0	Dad, Mom says to stop trying to give yourself cancer.	[]
Randy	14	0	Just gonna get a little bit of cancer, Stan. Tell Mom it's okay.	[]

Cartman	26	0	Whoa, what uh, are you serious?  Oh my God, that's KFC gravy!  You have KFC! Yes!  This is it? One lousy little cup of gravy?!	[]
Other	11	0	This is a clinic to help you get over your addiction.	[]
Cartman	14	0	Who wants just gravy?! It goes on mashed potatoes! On extra-crispy chicken skins!	[]
Other	9	0	If you don't want it, that's fine-	[]
Cartman	9	0	NO!  Oh God, oh God it's so good.	[]
Randy	103	1	Frozen and processed foods appear to have a direct link to many forms of stomach and colon cancers. Alright.  Tests show that preservatives found in these foods are the leading cause. However, luckily most of these cancers are...  slow-growing and can take years to develop. Dammit.  Testicular cancer. Most common in older men and can be extremely aggressive. Oh this is good. There's no data on what causes testicular cancer to grow so rapidly, however the primary causes of testicular cancer are linked to exposure to high doses of radiation Hmmm.  Oh hey, Stan, could you grab me a beer?  Stan?	['dammit']
Randy	5	0	Whoahhh! Sharon. Hey, hey Sharon!	[]
Other	2	0	Wha... WAAAAA!	[]
Other	16	0	Mr. Marsh, I'm afraid that the tests came back positive. You do have testicular cancer.	[]
Randy	1	0	SCORE!	[]
Other	18	0	Now, the good new is it hasn't spread anywhere. We should... probably schedule to have them re-	[]
Randy	11	0	Yeahyeahyeahyeah, but for now can I finally get my prescription please?!	[]
Other	4	0	Your prescription for what?	[]
Randy	18	0	Buffalo Soldier... in the heart of America. Stolen from Africa, brought into America. He was fighting on arrival...	[]
Randy	18	0	One ounce of Purple Lurple, two ounces of Fisherman's Friend, and a half ounce of Alabama Kush!	[]
Randy	7	0	Uh that is nice! That is nice!	[]
Other	5	1	Randy! Jesus, Randy. Your balls!	['balls']
Randy	13	0	I know. Smokin' pot right in front of a cop. Pretty sweet, huh?	[]
Other	6	1	No, I mean, your actual balls!	['balls']
Randy	19	1	Oh, yeah. Testicular cancer. Here, here, you want some? Oh wait, you're healthy! Hey bust his ass, officer!	['ass']
Other	10	0	Hey kid, they say you're looking for some KFC.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Yeah. Who isn't?	[]
Other	12	0	Yeah well uh, we got some. Over at Billy Miller's house.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Billy Miller? Seriously??	[]
Other	4	0	Ahhh Eric Cartman, right?	[]
Cartman	6	0	Tommy said you have some KFC.	[]
Other	2	0	Suuure.  Jessie.	[]
Cartman	20	0	Oh my God, the Colonel's popcorn chicken and honey-mustard sauce!  Oh God yes!  Where did you get that?!	[]
Other	8	0	I have my sources. That'll be $85.	[]
Cartman	7	0	85 bucks?? I don't have that!	[]
Other	48	0	Hold on, hold on.  You're a big boy, Eric. Maybe you can pay me back another way. Do a little job for me. I've got some serious KFC coming in from a dealer. I need somebody willing to get a little risky and... pick it up.	[]
Cartman	6	0	How much KFC are we talking?	[]
Other	10	0	Two buckets plus a three-piece meal and four sides.	[]
Cartman	3	1	Holy fuck, dude.	['fuck']
Other	40	0	I've got the money to pay for it, but it's become a risky business out there. You get the chicken for me, and I'll make sure you're hooked up for life. Do you wanna do it?	[]
Cartman	15	0	Do I wanna do it? Does the Pope help pedophiles get away with their crime?	[]
Other	1	0	Excellent.	[]
Randy	47	1	Alright, see you tomorrow!  Oh God, I gotta hurry! Caprica starts in five minutes!  Huh-oh Jesus!  Ugh, ohh.  Uhh, hey, can somebody..?  ...Rrrr. Ugh, I gotta get home.  Hey, hey, hey, this can work. This could... Hey, it's like a hoppity hop. Aaahah. Whoa-ho.	['ho']
Cartman	3	0	Are you Teabag?	[]
Other	6	0	Maybe I am. Who's askin'?	[]
Cartman	7	1	Cut the crap. You got the stuff?	['crap']
Other	21	0	Oh, I got the hookup. Question is, you got the money?  Alright, we're in biz.  It's all there, man.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Extra crispy?	[]
Other	7	0	'Course, man, I ain't no fool.	[]
Cartman	13	1	You trying to fuck me dude? This is cut with Boston Market gravy!	['fuck']
Other	8	1	Awww, it's all the same shit, man.	['shit']
Cartman	6	1	IT'S NOT THE SAME SHIT!	['shit']
Other	6	0	Okay okay I'm sorry, oh...	[]
Cartman	17	1	You're cuttin' Colonel's gravy with Boston Market to try and save yourself some fuckin' money!	['fuckin']
Other	6	0	I'll take back the gravy.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Like anybody wants KFC without gravy!	[]
Other	14	0	AAAH please. Please, I'm sorry! Take your money back! Take the KFC too!	[]
Other	6	0	What's going on back there?	[]
Cartman	4	0	Nothin', it's cool.	[]
Other	9	0	Alright, I'll call. Forty-five to you Ned.	[]
Randy	18	0	Oh man. This Rainy Day Woman is the bomb. You guys don't know what you're missing.	[]
Other	12	0	Well you know, you could share some of that with us, Randy.	[]
Randy	13	0	No, Nelson, that's illegal! I can smoke this because I have cancer.	[]
Other	9	0	Aw some on, just give us a little bit.	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Randy	61	1	Get your own medicinal marijuana cards! You've all got perfectly good microwaves at home! Look, I'm telling you guys, it's awesome. I can have all the pot I want, I get around faster than walking, and, wherever I need a seat, I can just sit on my balls. And let me tell you something else.  Chicks... love 'em.	['balls']
Other	4	1	Women love huge balls?	['balls']
Randy	32	1	Loove 'em. Everywhere I go, when I walk by, chicks are like turning their heads and going whaaa? I never knew how much women love guys' balls until I got these puppies.	['balls']
Other	8	0	Travis, did you take out the garba-whaaa?	[]
Randy	1	0	See?	[]
Other	7	0	Cartman my boy, you got the stuff?	[]
Cartman	10	0	Yeah I got the stuff.  And I got the money.	[]
Other	10	0	Heyyy you're good Eric. I need people like you!	[]
Cartman	13	0	Good, 'cause I ate a bunch of chicken on the way over here.	[]
Other	50	0	That's alright Eric. I've got something big in the works. What if I told you... that I now have a direct line to get all the KFC we want here? I'm sending Tommy to Kentucky, to try and set up a little arrangement with the Colonel himself.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Wait a minute. You mean THE Colonel?	[]
Other	27	0	That's right. And I'd like you to go as well and watch Tommy's back for me. Is that something you'd want to do?	[]
Cartman	19	0	Is that something I'd want to do? Is the Pope Catholic? And making the world safe for pedophiles?	[]
Other	1	0	Excellent.	[]
Other	8	0	Doctor, Mr. Klein's test results came in.	[]
Other	6	1	What the hell is going on?	['hell']
Other	1	0	Doctor?	[]
Other	25	0	This is the tenth case I've seen this week. It can't be a coincidence. Something in this town is giving men testicular cancer.	[]
Other	7	1	Heh, I am stoned off my ass!	['ass']
Other	6	1	I'm stoned off my balls!	['balls']
Randy	8	0	Anybody got more of that loompa loompa weed?	[]
Other	6	1	Wow. Those guys have nice balls.	['balls']
Other	7	1	Wish my man had balls like those.	['balls']
Other	1	0	Mmm.	[]
Other	39	0	Our entire production is headquartered here, boys. We move over sixteen tons of chicken every month. Of course, with the new laws in Colorado my business has taken quite a hit. I'm worried other states might follow suit.	[]
Other	24	0	We know, Colonel, but we can get your chicken into the state. We just need a bulk deal, say, four ninety five a key?	[]
Cartman	16	0	I've got to hand it to you, Colonel. You have everything a man could want.	[]
Other	30	0	I like you, Eric. There's no lying in you. Unfortunately, I don't feel the same about your friend. Cartman: Who? You mean Tommy?  Wait, where's he go?	[]
Other	8	0	Your partner is an informant for Jamie Oliver.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Dude, that was sweet! He's all choked.	[]
Other	11	0	And how do I know you're not a liar too?	[]
Cartman	21	0	Hey, Colonel! I've been your biggest supporter since I was two years old! I love your chicken! I love you!	[]
Other	17	0	I think... you and me can work this thing out, Eric. Do business together a long time.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Good.	[]
Other	21	2	Just remember, I only tell you one time. Don't fuck me, Eric. Don't you ever try to fuck me.	['fuck', 'fuck']
Other	12	1	Randy! Randy, will you look at yourself? Your balls are getting bigger.	['balls']
Randy	15	0	I know. They're pretty swollen. Kinda hurts. I'm gonna buy some more weed.	[]
Other	15	0	Randy, please. When you get back, do you think maybe we could make love again?	[]
Randy	7	0	Ohhh, someone's feeling frisky again. huh?	[]
Other	15	0	Oh, it's just that I thought that more alone time would maybe be really-	[]
Randy	6	0	Hey. My eyes are up here.	[]
Other	5	0	I'm sorry, I just...	[]
Randy	27	1	It's alright, I just want you to look at me when we make love and not just at my balls. I'll be home soon, babe.	['balls']
Randy	15	0	Hey uh, could you uh, give me half a pound of that Suburban Sunrise, please?	[]
Other	12	0	I'm sorry sir, but you have to be inside the store.	[]
Randy	12	0	Well eh, I'm right here, can you just... bring it over?	[]
Other	13	0	Selling medicinal marijuana outside the confines of an approved shop is still illegal.	[]
Randy	14	0	Look I'm startin' to feel kind of stupid; can I please get high?	[]
Other	23	0	What, are you crazy Eric?! Making a deal with the Colonel for ten thousand more boxes?! I can't move that much chicken!	[]
Cartman	7	0	Will you relax, Billy? It's fine!	[]
Other	41	1	...Fine? I'm not making any money here! I'm losing it! I have to pay for more security, I got the cops up my ass, and I have to pay for all these orders to cut the chicken for distribution!	['ass']
Cartman	14	0	Billy, Billy, we've gotta be thinking bigger here! It's time to expand!	[]
Other	36	0	How can I expand when thirty-six percent of our product is going to you?! Get out there and sell the chicken or get lost! You've forgotten who the boss of this operation is, Eric!	[]
Cartman	11	0	...Yeah welll, you're not gonna be around a lot longer.	[]
Other	6	0	What is that supposed to mean?	[]
Cartman	13	0	I...  told your mom you got an F on that social studies test.	[]
Other	5	0	You wouldn't do that.	[]
Cartman	23	2	Does a bear crap in the woods? And does the Pope crap on the broken lives and dreams of two hundred deaf boys?	['crap', 'crap']
Other	10	0	Billy?! Your father and I want to talk to you!	[]
Cartman	20	0	Bye bye Billy.  Alright everyone listen up! I'm in charge now! Anybody got a problem with that? Alright, good.	[]
Randy	4	0	What do we want?	[]
Other	2	0	Bigger doors!	[]
Randy	5	0	Where do we want them?	[]
Other	2	0	Weed stores!	[]
Randy	4	0	What do we want?	[]
Other	2	0	Bigger doors!	[]
Randy	5	0	Where do we want them?	[]
Other	2	0	Weed stores!	[]
Other	15	0	Look, I'm sorry, but the bill says I can't modify any existing structure.	[]
Other	23	0	Well I guess we could change the law to allow for medicinal marijuana to be sold just outside the door of the shop.	[]
Other	18	0	Egah I don't know, maybe the rule should be somebody can buy the medicinal weed for others.	[]
Other	23	0	Look, can't we skip all this and just make pot legal? Everyone is just abusing this medicinal system anyway, it's ridiculous.	[]
Other	5	0	What's ridiculous about it?	[]
Other	48	0	Hold on, hold people people, please!  We are all forgetting what is really at issue here! Look around! These men all have cancer! It's no coincidence that when this building changed, the rise in cancer went up. Don't you see? The KFC was keeping people healthy!	[]
Other	20	0	Mr. Cartman, come on. We're supposed to be handling the business; you're eating too much of the stuff.	[]
Cartman	10	1	Shut up Kevin! I'm the boss, not you, buttlicker!	['buttlicker']
Other	12	0	Eric, the Colonel is on the phone for you. He sounds pissed.	[]
Cartman	15	1	What?! Oh, that's right, I forgot to- Dammit! Uh, okay.  Put him on speaker.	['dammit']
Other	2	0	Hello. Hello??	[]
Cartman	5	0	Colonel, how are you doing?	[]
Other	2	0	What happened?	[]
Cartman	8	0	Oh, we had some problems, you know? Colonel?	[]
Other	3	0	Eric, what happened??	[]
Cartman	5	0	We had a little problem.	[]
Other	2	0	I heard.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Yeah? How'd, how'd you hear that?	[]
Other	19	0	Because Jamie Oliver gave his speech at the UN today. He was not supposed to give that speech, Eric!	[]
Cartman	10	0	Hey that's okay, we'll get him next time.	[]
Other	13	2	There's not going to be a next time you fucking dumb cocksucker!	['fucking', 'cocksucker']
Cartman	5	0	Hey, take it easy Colonel.	[]
Other	15	2	I told you a long time ago, you fucking little monkey, not to fuck me!	['fucking', 'fuck']
Cartman	16	2	Hey! Hey who the fuck do you think you're talking to, huh?! Huh?!  Oh crap!	['fuck', 'crap']
Other	1	0	Freeze!	[]
Other	4	0	It's the cops!	[]
Other	3	0	Run Billy, run!	[]
Other	2	0	Mommy, no!	[]
Other	43	0	Last November, this town passed a bill that seemed silly to some. Since then we've had underground black markets, crime, death, and shootings. But now the bill has been repealed, and I am relieved to announce that once again, marijuana is illegal.	[]
Other	38	0	And another bill has been repealed as well. Because ever since we got rid of KFC, we've seen a great rise in cancer. But today we welcome back KFC, and all the medical benefits it gives us.	[]
Randy	19	1	Well I got to admit, it's a lot easier to get in doors with my little prosthetic balls.	['balls']
Other	2	0	Yeah. Great.	[]
Randy	12	0	Aw, Sharon, don't be upset. The doctor made you a souvenir.	[]
Other	4	0	Randy, I love it!	[]
Randy	7	0	And when it gets cold it shrinks.	[]
Other	6	1	Sharon, you got a scrotum coat?	['scrotum']
Other	1	0	Yyyup!	[]
Other	1	0	Luckyyyyy!	[]
