Other	1	0	Where?	[]
Other	54	0	I was out in the woods, praying  I was asking God if I should be a Protestant, or a Catholic, or what? And suddenly God and Jesus appeared before me.  And they said I should start my own church, because none of the others had it right.  And that's exactly how it happened.	[]
Other	6	0	You see? You believe it now?	[]

Stan	8	0	The guy who spoke to God and Jesus.	[]
Other	11	0	Well, Stan, God and Jesus don't actually speak to people.	[]
Stan	7	0	That's not what the Harrisons said.	[]
Randy	4	0	Who are the Harrisons?	[]
Stan	30	0	The new people that moved in down the street. Mr. Harrison said that Joseph Smith spoke to God and Jesus and they told him none of the religions were right.	[]
Randy	9	0	Oh, did he now?! What are they, religious kooks?!	[]
Stan	33	0	They're not kooks, they're cool. I mean, how come we never have a night where we don't watch any TV and we just... do stuff together and eat and drink?	[]
Randy	10	0	We have that, Stan. It's called Friday Night Kegger.	[]
Stan	8	0	But that's just you and your friends.	[]
Other	5	1	I said shut up, turd!	['turd']
Stan	21	0	Mr. Harrison said that I should be followng Heavenly Father's plan, and I don't even know what that is.	[]
Randy	5	0	All right, that does it!	[]
Other	4	0	Where are you going?	[]

Stan	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Randy	8	1	Jyeah, I'm gonna go kick his ass!	['ass']

Other	1	0	Hello!	[]
Randy	5	0	Yeah, are you Mr. Harrison?	[]
Other	8	0	I sure am.  The, the name's Gary.	[]

Other	19	0	Oh, you're Stan's dad! It's so nice to finally meet you! Karen! Mr. Marsh is here!	[]

Other	10	0	Karen just finished baking the most amazing Rice Crispy squares.	[]
Other	3	0	With chocolate frosting	[]
Other	13	0	Come on out of the cold. You've gotta try one. Or six.	[]
Other	12	0	I cannot tell you how wonderful it is to have you over.	[]
Other	10	0	I hear you're a geologist. That is so amazing.	[]
Randy	21	0	Look, uh, I actually came over because I'm a little concerned about some of the things you told my son.	[]
Other	2	0	Uh huh?	[]
Randy	6	0	You know. About... God, and stuff.	[]
Other	11	0	Oooh... Oh boy... you think we were trying to convert him.	[]
Randy	2	0	Well, I-	[]
Other	7	0	Oh, Mr. Marsh, I am sooo sorry.	[]
Other	33	0	We just moved here from Utah and we're so used to everyone being Mormon that we... Oh, we forget not everyuone wants to hear about it. Oh boy, you must be furious!	[]
Randy	5	0	Well, no, no, I just-	[]
Other	39	0	You just heard your son talking about religious ideals that aren't your own and you said Who the heck do these people think they are?! I I'm really, truly sorry, Mr. Marsh. It won't happen again.	[]
Randy	6	0	Y-you can call me... Randy.	[]
Other	32	0	Randy, the last thing we want is for people to think we're pushing our religion. We know there are a lot of beliefs out there and ours just works for us.	[]
Other	5	0	To each his own, right?	[]
Randy	41	0	Yeah. Yeah! You know, to be honist, I've never known any Mormons. I, don't even know what you people believe. Who was this Joseph Smith guy? Why did he believe that Native Americans are actually white people from Jerusalem?	[]
Other	21	0	Well, because they found ancient books they had written on gold plates, right where the angel Moroni said they would be.	[]
Other	16	0	I found them! I found them!  You're not gonne believe it, everybody! I found them!	[]
Other	2	0	Found what?	[]
Other	6	0	Another New Testament of Jesus Christ!	[]
Other	8	0	What? What did he say? Are you crazy?	[]
Other	37	0	Last night, a Native America angel told me where I could find another testament of Jesus Christ, so I went out to the woods. I dug around all morning where the angel had told me to look.	[]
Other	14	0	Maybe there isn't anything out here.  Wait a tick!  What's this?  Wow...	[]
Other	21	0	Inside the stone box, I found the magical seer stones. Under that, I found four gold plates written in strange writing .	[]
Other	10	0	This must be the Gospel that Jesus told the Nephites!	[]
Other	12	0	Well, they were the most amazing things I'd ever gazed upon.	[]
Other	5	0	Well, so where are they?	[]
Other	3	0	Where are what?	[]
Other	10	0	The gold plates and the seer stones. Where are they?	[]
Other	60	0	Oh. Oh, well, I... was not allowed to take them. You see, after I found the plates, the angel Moroni appeared to me again and said that I am not allowed to show the plates, or the seer stones, to anybody. Because first I must translate what's written on the plates into English, so you can all read it!	[]
Other	5	0	Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb	[]
Other	2	0	Wow, amazing!	[]
Other	24	0	He found the stones and golden plates Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb Even though nobody else ever saw them Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb	[]
Stan	13	1	So, how'd it go, Clubber Lange? You kicked Mr. Harrison's ass?	['ass']
Randy	13	0	Not exactly. We're uh, having their family over for dinner tomorrow night.	[]
Stan	7	0	See? That's what happened to me!	[]
Randy	19	0	Sharon, did you know this guy Joseph Smith found a new testament to the Bible buried here in America?	[]
Other	5	0	What are you talking about?	[]
Randy	31	0	Well it's just that... the Harrisons are really nice people and... you should see how loving and together their family is. I, I think there's something to that religion.	[]
Stan	8	0	That's what they made me think, too!	[]
Randy	12	0	All right, that does it. From now on, our family is Mormon!	[]
Cartman	12	0	Hey Stan, how was your date last night with the new kid?	[]
Stan	16	0	Shut up, dude. They're a nice family and... Gary is actually really smart and talented.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Aww, you guys. I think Stan's in love.	[]
Kyle	8	0	Yeah. Did you make out with him, too?	[]
Stan	18	0	What's the big deal? Can't I have other friends? You guys should give Gary a chance.	[]
Other	2	0	Hey Stan.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Ohhh, here's Stan's little girlfriend now.	[]
Other	35	0	Hey guys. Stan, I remember you said last night that you'd lost your wallet, so I made you a new one.  I carved a picture of John Elway into the leather on the front.	[]
Stan	4	0	Wow, you made this?	[]
Cartman	10	0	Awww, look at them. Aren't they so cute together?	[]
Other	19	0	Hey! My family's on their way over to the fire station to donate blood. You wanna come along?	[]
Stan	11	0	Un, I don't think so, Gary. I have to uh...	[]
Other	6	0	Oh here comes my family now!	[]
Other	3	0	Hey you guys!	[]
Other	5	0	Look, we painted our faces!	[]
Other	4	0	I'm a lion.	[]
Other	4	0	I'm an alien.	[]
Other	10	0	Hey, just what the heck am I supposed to be?	[]
Cartman	3	0	Oh my God...	[]
Other	10	0	You gonna come with us to the fire station, Stan?	[]
Stan	9	0	Uh, no. I've got a lot to do.	[]
Other	11	0	Well... Gary, you wanna just hang out with your friend Stan?	[]
Other	16	0	Oh. Well, I'd like to, but... Oh man, I would miss you guys so much!	[]
Other	7	0	We'd miss you too, Gary. Heh.	[]
Other	24	0	Aw, we'll all see each other tonight when we go to Stan's house for dinner. Stay and play with your friend, Gary.	[]
Other	6	0	Yeah. Have a good time, boys.	[]
Other	7	0	Let's go.  Our faces are painted.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Wow!	[]
Other	7	0	So what do you guys wanna do?	[]
Cartman	28	0	Uh, that's cool. We're gonna leave you two lovebirds alone. The three of us have to go put in some volunteer work at the homeless shelter.	[]
Other	8	0	Oh cool! I'm gonna do that tomorrow.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Eeheehee, Jesus Christ.	[]
Other	22	0	So hey, I heard your dad came over last night and he and my dad talked about Joseph Smith. That's great!	[]
Stan	10	0	Yyeah. I had a question about that Joseph Smith guy.	[]
Other	1	0	Sure.	[]
Stan	12	0	What happened after he found the golden plates buried in the ground?	[]
Other	26	0	Well, he kept them hidden from everyone like he was told. And then he translated what was written on the plates into the Book of Mormon.	[]
Stan	3	0	Yeah, but... how?	[]
Other	5	0	Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb	[]
Other	7	0	What's this all about, Mr. Smith?	[]
Other	7	0	Mr. Harris, can you keep a secret?	[]
Other	4	0	Well, sure I can.	[]
Other	23	0	I have, in my possession, an ancient book written on gold plates that tells of Jesus Christ's second coming. Here, in America.	[]
Other	7	0	In America?  Really? That sounds kind of...	[]
Other	5	0	Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb	[]
Other	50	0	It's true. And I'm going to translate the plates and publish it into a book for the whole world to read. Now, ahah-I know you have a lot of money, Mr. Harris, and I'm just gonna need a little bit to pay for the publishing costs.	[]
Other	13	0	Mmm, I don't know. Uh, how do you expect to translate it?	[]
Other	2	0	With these.	[]
Other	1	0	Rocks?	[]
Other	63	0	They're not rocks. They're seer stones, given to me by an angel. With them, God allowed me to translate the plates into English. Watch. You take this quill and paper and write down what I say. Sit here.  I have the golden plates here in this hat. I need to have them somewhere dark so I can read the spiritual light.	[]
Other	1	0	Really?	[]
Other	26	0	Now, when I put the seer stones into the hat, the ancient letter light up and change into English, which I can then read to you.	[]
Other	1	0	Wow!	[]
Other	21	0	Ooo, I'm seeing the light. Oh, okay. Write this down. And... so... it... was... that... Christ... appeared before... the... Nephites.	[]
Other	39	0	And that's how the Book of Mormon was written Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb Dumb dadumb dumb dumb dumb dumb Dumb dadumb dumb dumb dumb dumb Dahumb dahumb dumb dumb dumb dumb Dumb dumb dumb dumb duuumb, duuumb.	[]
Randy	21	0	One two three four. Pay one thousand dollars property tax.  Isn't this great, you guys? Our first Family Home Evening.	[]
Other	4	0	I wanna watch TV.	[]
Randy	16	0	We're not watching TV! We're Mormons now and we're having Family Home Evening!	[]
Stan	18	0	Dad, did you know that that Joseph Smith guy read the Book of Mormon out of a hat?	[]
Randy	4	0	And?  Your turn, Sharon.	[]
Stan	24	0	It's just that... the Book of Mormon says a lot of strange stuff, like that Adam and Eve lived in Jackson County, Missouri.	[]
Randy	1	0	Yes.	[]
Stan	13	0	But school taught me that the first man and woman lived in Africa.	[]
Randy	19	0	Well you can't believe everything school tells you, Stan. Your turn, Shelly.  Oooo, that must be the Harrisons!	[]
Other	2	0	Hey everybody.	[]
Other	5	0	Wow, what a great house!	[]
Other	12	0	You must be Mrs. Marsh; it's so nice to meet youuu!	[]
Other	15	0	And you must be Stan's sister. Oh, I think your brother's the greatest.	[]
Other	6	1	My brother is a stupid turd.	['turd']
Other	2	0	Hey Stan.	[]
Stan	2	0	Hey Gary.	[]
Randy	25	0	Well, come on in and sit down, everybody.  You're here just in time. My son was having a little problem with our new religion.	[]
Stan	1	0	Dad!	[]
Other	27	0	Ohohoho, really? Wel, that's just because he hasn't heard the best part about the Joseph Smith story! The one that proves he was for real!	[]
Other	2	0	Yeah! Woohoo!	[]
Randy	4	0	Ooo, what's that?	[]
Other	19	0	Well, you remember Martin Harris, the rich man who wrote down what Joseph Smith read out of the hat?	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Other	20	0	See, after he was done, he took some of the pages of what would become the Book of Mormon home.	[]
Other	25	0	Martin went home to his wife Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb And showed her pages from the Book of Mormon Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb	[]
Other	35	0	A-and so Joseph Smith put his head into a hat, a-and read to me what the golden plates said. I wrote it all down and we're gonna publish it into a book.	[]
Other	20	0	Martin, how do you know he isn't just making stuff up and pretending he's translating off golden plates?	[]
Other	10	0	Lucy Harris smart smart smart Smart smart smart smart smart	[]
Other	6	0	Why would he make it up?	[]
Other	4	0	Martin Harris dumb dadumb-	[]
Other	46	0	All right, here. I'm gonna hide these pages.  If Joseph Smith really is translating off of golden plates, then he'll be able to do it again. But if Joseph Smith is making it all up, then the new translations will be different from these.	[]
Other	9	0	Okay, fine. I bet he'll have no problem.	[]
Other	37	0	Lucy Harris smart smart smart Martin Harris dumb. So Martin went on back to Smith Said the pages had gone away Smith got mad and told Martin He needed to go pray Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb	[]
Other	29	0	Look, ah I'm sorry about losin' the pages we worked on, Joe, but I'm ready to write it all down again if you translate from the plates.	[]
Other	27	0	I would love to, Martin, except, I just had a vision. And the Lord said he's very angry with me for letting you take those pages.	[]
Other	2	0	He is??	[]
Other	5	0	Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb	[]
Other	42	0	Yes. He is so mad that he will never let me translate from the plate of Lehi again. He's... we must now translate from the plate of Nephi. So it will be the same basic story, but written a little differently.	[]
Other	14	0	Wow! If God got angry with you, then you must be tellin' the truth.	[]
Other	7	0	Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb.	[]
Other	8	0	All right, Martin. Let's get to work!	[]
Other	6	0	And that's how it happened.	[]
Other	3	0	Yeah! All right!	[]
Stan	15	0	...Wait. Mormons actually know this story and they still believe Joseph Smith was a prophet?	[]
Other	9	0	Well sure. The story proves it, doesn't it?	[]
Stan	12	0	No, it proves he DID make it all up. Are you blind?	[]
Other	9	0	Well, Stan, it's all a matter of faith.	[]
Stan	79	0	No, it's a matter of logic! If you're gonna say things that have been proven wrong, like that the first man and woman lived in Missouri, and that Native Americans came from Jerusalem, then you'd better have something to back it up. All you've got are a bunch of stories about some asswipe who read plates nobody ever saw out of a hat, and then couldn't do it again when the translatios were hidden!	[]
Randy	7	0	Hey, Stan, don't denounce our religion.	[]
Stan	7	0	I don't wanna be Mormon, Dad!	[]
Other	2	0	Me neither.	[]
Other	12	0	Hey, that's only cool, guys. You can believe whatever you want!	[]
Other	9	0	Yeah, it's great you have your own beliefs.	[]
Other	5	0	Yeah! Hooray for the Marshes!	[]
Stan	56	0	Oh, stop it!  That's another thing! Why do you have to be so freakin' nice all the time?! It isn't normal! You just weasel people into your way of thinking by acting like the happiest family in the world and being so nice to everyone that you just blindside dumb people like my Dad!	[]
Randy	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Other	10	0	Well kids... Who's up for a water balloon fight?!	[]
Other	3	0	Yeah! All right!	[]

Other	137	1	Look, maybe us Mormons do believe in crazy stories that make absolutely no sense, and maybe Joseph Smith did make it all up, but I have a great life. and a great family, and I have the Book of Mormon to thank for that. The truth is, I don't care if Joseph Smith made it all up, because what the church teaches now is loving your family, being nice and helping people. And even though people in this town might think that's stupid, I still choose to believe in it. All I ever did was try to be your friend, Stan, but you're so high and mighty you couldn't look past my religion and just be my friend back. You've got a lot of growing up to do, buddy. Suck my balls.	['balls']
Cartman	6	1	Damn, that kid is cool, huh?	['damn']
