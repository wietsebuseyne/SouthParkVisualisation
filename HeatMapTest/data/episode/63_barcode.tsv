Other	21	0	Alright, children, as I'm sure you all remember, today we are going to continue our biology lesson... dissecting an organism.	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Other	1	0	Woohoo.	[]
Other	31	0	Now, what we are going to dissect today is the West Indian manatee.  Manatees are mammals that live in the oceans and are often called the gentle clowns of the sea.	[]
Wendy	7	0	Uhh, Ms. Choksondik, aren't manatees endangered?	[]
Other	40	0	They sure are, Wendy, and that's why we must learn what's inside them.  Now, we don't have quite enough  manatees to go around, so I think we're gonna have to split up into groups of four.	[]
Butters	5	0	Hey! Ours is still alive!	[]
Other	13	0	Oh, hold on.  Now, children, our first incision will be along the abdomen.	[]
Stan	6	0	I can't do it, dude.	[]

Other	5	0	I don't see anything.	[]
Other	5	0	Look closer.  Closer.  Hunh-nh.	[]
Other	7	0	I still don't see anything, Phillip.	[]

Other	3	0	Eh yes, sweetie.	[]
Cartman	13	0	Mom.can you go make me a toaster pastry chocolate-mix butter ball?	[]
Other	14	0	Oohh, honey, why don't you make it yourself?  Mommy's  expecting  some company.	[]
Cartman	7	0	God, I have to everything around here!	[]
Cartman	14	1	I'mo drag home myself, babih. But the-  What the hell's going on?	['hell']

Cartman	2	1	Fat camp?	['fat']
Other	3	1	Yes, fat camp.	['fat']
Cartman	28	5	Alright, I don't know who the hell put you all up to this,  but I am sure as hell not going to any gay-ass fat camp!	['hell', 'hell', 'gay', 'ass', 'fat']
Mr. Mackey	19	0	Now, Eric, all these people came here and paid to send you to camp because they care about you.	[]
Mr. Garrison	18	0	Yeah, except for me. I just wanted to see the look on your face when they told you.	[]
Cartman	36	1	Mom, tell them! Tell them I'm not fat, I'm just big-boned! Tell them all those stories about how everyone in your family was big as a child but then grew into their bodies!	['fat']
Other	10	1	Oh, sweetie, those were all lies. You're just fat.	['fat']
Other	19	0	And now we will be removing the spleen. Notice how the manatee's spleen is designed for a qu-	[]
Other	11	0	Ah, Ms. Choksondik, can we have a quick word with you?	[]
Other	14	0	Alright, continue with the removal of the spleen, children. I'll be right back.	[]

Stan	4	0	That's so gross.	[]
Kyle	9	0	Hey, Kenny. How much for you to eat this?	[]
Kenny	5	0	(I'm not eatin' that!)	[]
Kyle	9	0	I'll give you ten bucks to eat it.	[]
Stan	5	0	I'll throw in five.	[]
Other	28	0	And so apparently there's been a little mixup. The manatees were meant to go to the Denver Shelter Aquarium and the frogs were meant to come here.	[]
Other	2	0	Oh dear.	[]
Butters	6	0	I'll throw in a dollar!	[]
Bebe	4	0	I've got three.	[]
Kyle	12	0	Come on, dude. All you gotta do is eat it very fast!	[]

Other	21	0	Alright, children, now, let's get back in our seats. Uh, we are now going to put the manatees back together.	[]
Other	47	0	...And it has basketball courts and tennis courts, and you can call Mommy any time you want.  Oh, sweetie-kins, don't be mad. I'm sure you're going to have a good time. And when you come back you'll be all healthy and thin.	[]
Other	15	0	Howdy there. I'm one of the weight counselors here. This must be Eric Cartman.	[]
Other	9	0	Yes. I'm afraid he's a little moody.	[]
Other	15	0	Oh, we'll change that.  Hello, camper. My name is Rick. How are you doing?	[]
Cartman	9	0	Well, I'm pissed off!, Rick! How are you?	[]
Other	27	0	I'm doing great! Why don't you come on out and we'll get yo oriented.  I'll take care of him from here, ma'am.	[]
Other	4	0	Oh.  Well, goodbye, sweetie.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Don't touch me!	[]
Other	12	0	Eric, this is the beginning of a whole new life for you!	[]
Other	5	0	Have you got any candy?	[]
Cartman	1	0	No.	[]
Other	18	0	My mom says I ain't to eat no candy here. I'm s'psoed to lose weight.	[]
Other	29	0	Alright! Everybody's here and that means we can get down to business! Over the next few weeks we're gonna learn that losing weight is  fun, right gang?	[]
Other	1	0	Right.	[]
Other	13	0	Wait a second.  Do you kids hear something?  I could've swore that-	[]
Other	1	0	Raaarrrr!!!	[]
Other	7	1	Oh no, kids! It's glutinous fat!	['fat']
Other	11	0	I'm gonna take over your body and make you slow!	[]
Other	20	0	Oh! What are we going to do? Wait! I know! I could knock it out! With... Exercise!  And... Proper Diet.	[]
Other	9	0	Oh no! Exercise and proper diet have killed me.	[]
Other	14	1	I guess we took care of that bad old fat, didn't we kids?	['fat']
Other	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Other	20	1	Well, hold on a second. Because that glutinous fat was really our good friend, Susan,  who's another weight counselor!	['fat']
Other	8	0	Heh! It was a lady in a costume!	[]
Cartman	9	1	Would somebody put this retard out of his misery?!	['retard']
Kyle	4	0	What's the matter?	[]
Stan	12	0	Kenny's not feeling so good. That manatee spleen made him sick.	[]
Kyle	12	0	Uh oh. I guess we shouldn't have made him eat it.	[]
Other	1	0	Eewww.	[]
Stan	10	0	Well, at least you got it out of your system.	[]
Kyle	12	0	Aw, dude! You can still kinda see the spleen!  How much, Kenny?	[]

Stan	9	0	You know, dude, there might be something to this.	[]
Kyle	14	0	Yeah. People are willing to pay big money to see Kenny do this stuff.	[]
Other	5	0	Doing great kids! Come on!	[]
Cartman	3	1	This... is... bullcrap!	['bullcrap']
Other	13	0	Well, I sure enjoyed my carrots and protein bar! How about you, gang?	[]
Cartman	12	0	I'm starving. This is it. I'm going to die here.	[]
Other	12	0	I hope you all left room for dessert. Soybean pudding for everybody!	[]
Other	8	0	Are you going to eat your soybean pudding?	[]
Cartman	8	1	Take it! I can't eat this crap!	['crap']
Other	13	0	Me neither. I have to have sugar or I'm going to die.	[]
Cartman	19	1	Yeah, well, when I was in prison, we used to sneak stuff in by hiding it up our ass.	['ass']
Other	11	1	I have some Fudge 'Ems up my ass. You want some?	['ass']
Cartman	10	0	Psss. Yeah, I'm not falling for that one again!	[]
Cartman	57	0	Alright, Clyde Frog. We just gotta clear the counselor building and we're free.  We did it, Clyde Frog! Now the only question is, do we go home to our traitor moms and friends, or do we start a new life on the run?  An ice cream truck! Hey wait!  Boy, am I glad to see you!	[]
Other	8	0	Can I interest you in some ice cream?	[]
Cartman	10	1	You're damn right you can! Two Roller Pops, please!	['damn']
Other	9	0	Alrighty, do you want this kind or this kind?	[]
Cartman	2	0	Hunh?  Uuh!	[]
Other	5	0	They tricked us again, huh?	[]
Cartman	8	1	Aw, God-damnit!  LET ME OUT OF HMYA!	['damnit']
Other	14	0	Hang on, we'll be back at camp in a matter of no time.	[]
Other	22	0	They always get us. Sometimes it's a ice cream truck, sometimes it's a taco stand. But they always fool us.	[]
Other	17	0	Heh-I can't help it. I'd give anything. Any amount of money for some candy.	[]
Other	2	0	Hey kids!	[]
Other	9	0	Looks like we had some attempted escapees again tonight.	[]
Other	35	0	Escape-aroo! Now campers, I know that camp is tough, but you have to believe that you can do it. And you have to know that until you drop the weight, you can't leave.	[]
Other	4	0	There is no escape.	[]
Other	29	0	So let's just all put on our try-hard helmets, and accept that the only way for us to get out of camp, is to LOSE THE WEIGHT	[]
Other	2	1	Aw, damnit!	['damnit']
Other	8	0	That's what being young is all about.	[]
Mr. Garrison	6	0	But that's not the question.	[]
Other	4	0	Thanks for coming, everybody.	[]
Mr. Mackey	20	0	Uh what's all this about, Mrs. Cartman? Is Eric having trouble at havin' trouble at his weight-management camp?	[]
Stan	7	0	We knew he wouldn't make it.	[]
Other	27	0	Oh, no. Quite the contrary. Eric showed up and surprised me last night. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to present to you... the new Eric Cartman.	[]
Other	2	0	Hey, dudes!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Whoa!	[]
Stan	5	0	I don't believe it.	[]
Other	10	1	Believe it. He lost 40 pounds at his fat camp.	['fat']
Mr. Mackey	6	0	Eric, that's fantastic, m'kay?!	[]
Other	5	0	Congratulations. How do you feel?	[]
Other	3	0	I feel awesome!	[]
Kyle	19	1	What did they do with all the fat? There must have been enough to last an Eskimo family months.	['fat']
Other	44	1	You know, Kyle? There was a time when your fat jokes would have gotten to me. But now I'm totally slim and totally happy! In fact, I'd say I'm  a little bit trimmer than you, fatboy!  Heh heh. Just kidding, Kyle.	['fat']
Other	11	0	I made some healthy tofu pudding to celebrate. Who wants some?	[]
Cartman	1	0	Memememeee!	[]
Kyle	15	0	Dude. I don't know if I'm going to like the new Eric Cartman.	[]
Stan	6	0	Did you like the old one?	[]
Kyle	2	0	Good point.	[]
Other	12	0	And now back to Jesus and Pals, on South Park Public Access.	[]
Jesus	28	0	Back to our courageous story of a little boy's triumph over obesity. Eric, yea. You found that the Spirit of the Lord inside you gave you strength.	[]
Other	9	0	No. Actually, I found a diet that totally works.	[]
Jesus	34	1	A little boy who overcame the odds. Let's hear it for Eric Cartman!  Well, our second guest tonight is a young man named Kenny McCormick, who is going to eat dog crap. Kenny?	['crap']
Other	10	1	God-damnit, all I got was a little golf clap!	['damnit']
Jesus	7	0	Thanks for coming on the show, Kenny.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Sure!)	[]
Other	3	0	Do it again!	[]
Other	3	0	Do it again!	[]
Other	16	0	Hey kid! I'll give you 20 bucks to eat a really old piece of bacon!	[]
Other	3	0	This is ridiculous!	[]
Jesus	11	0	So. Kenny, how did you discover that you had this... talent?	[]
Stan	24	0	We thought of it, Jesus. I mean, Kenny's the one that does it all, but we were the masterminds of the whole thing.	[]
Jesus	10	0	I can't say I approve of this, my children.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Huh? Why not?	[]
Jesus	16	0	Because Kenny is only doing things that anybody could do. For money. He's a prostitute.	[]
Other	12	0	I'll pay him 50 bucks to eat someone else's vomit.	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Other	4	0	Yeah! Go for it!	[]
Stan	4	0	What's a prostitute?	[]
Kyle	4	0	I don't know.	[]
Chef	3	0	Hello there, children!	[]
Other	2	0	Hey, Chef:	[]
Stan	5	0	Chef, what's a prostitute?	[]
Chef	59	0	Dag-nabbit children! How come every time you come in here you gotta be askin' me questions that I shouldn't be answering?! Chef, what's the clitoris? What's a lesbian, Chef? How come they call it a rimjob, Chef?  For once, can't you just come in here and say, Hi Chef. Nice day, isn't it?!	[]
Stan	7	0	Hi Chef. Nice day, isn't it?	[]
Chef	5	0	It sure is! Thank you.	[]
Stan	5	0	Chef, what's a prostitute?	[]
Chef	14	0	Uh uh! You children are gonna get me in trouble with the principal again.	[]
Other	4	0	Lunchtime! I'm starved!	[]
Chef	4	0	Oh my God. Eric?	[]
Other	3	0	That's me.	[]
Stan	11	0	Chef was just about to tell us what a prostitute is.	[]
Chef	11	0	Why do you need to know what a prostitute is anyway?!	[]
Stan	11	0	Because Jesus told us that Kenny's a prostitute. Is he?	[]
Kenny	3	0	(Yeah. Am I?)	[]
Chef	10	0	Well, no, uh of course Kenny is not a prostitute.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Why?	[]
Chef	14	0	Well, because, children, a prostitute is someone who... you could pay for certain services.	[]
Stan	2	0	Like what?	[]
Chef	5	0	Like keeping you company. Understand?	[]
Stan	1	0	No.	[]
Chef	92	0	You see, children, sometimes a man needs to be with a woman. But sometimes, when the lovin' is over, the woman just wants to talk and talk and talk and talk.  But a prostitute is someone who would love you No matter who you are, or what you look like. Yes, it's true, children. That's not why you pay a prostitute, no, you don't pay her to stay, you pay her to leave afterwards. That's why I pays a lot for prostitutes! Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. James Taylor.	[]
Other	18	1	A prostitute is like any other woman They all trade somethin' for sex and they do it well.	['sex']
Chef	6	0	And that's why I say-	[]
Other	3	0	Prostitutes! Prostitutes! They-	[]

Cartman	16	0	Two donuts and a pack of licorice.  Well, Tony, the usual?  Why are you crying, Chad?	[]
Other	67	2	'Cause I'm always gonna be fat. I don't wanna eat no sweets, but I can't control myself when they're right in front of me like this.  All my life I've been fat. I've beh- I've been to seven camps and I swore to my momma that I'd lose the weight. I want to, but I can't help myself.	['fat', 'fat']
Cartman	12	0	Hey, Chad, eh... You know what you need? You need a friend.	[]

Other	8	0	Horace's parents want to take him home.	[]
Other	7	0	Oh! But he's not ready yet.	[]
Other	41	0	Look at what you've done to my boy! You told Horace that he was responsible for his weight! You made him believe that with exercise and proper diet, he could be thin! When we told you it was his genetics!	[]
Other	8	0	They can lose the weight if they try.	[]
Other	29	2	Look at these kids! They're not getting any thinner!  Your camp is a fraud! You need to accept the fact that most fat people are just genetically fat!	['fat', 'fat']

Butters	5	0	Who-what's a hummer??	[]
Stan	17	0	I don't know! All I know is Kenny is in jail for at least three months!	[]
Kyle	9	0	Three months?! But the pay-per-view is tomorrow!	[]
Stan	2	0	I know!	[]
Kyle	20	0	He worked so hard, come so close. Now we'll never see Kenny crawl up into Ms. Crabtree's uterus.	[]
Other	44	1	You know, maybe we've all learned something here. I mean, we set Kenny up to further and further himself each time, havin' to always outdo himself. Now he's in jail for being a whore. And perhaps, just perhaps, we are to blame.	['whore']
Kyle	22	1	...Alright, that does it!  This has been bothering the hell out of me!  I knew it! You're not Cartman at all!	['hell']
Other	2	0	Uh oh.	[]
