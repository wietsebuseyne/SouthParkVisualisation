Cartman	5	0	Kenny. Can't have Kenny.	[]

Other	9	0	I'm afraid he's... running out of time.	[]
Other	6	0	Why?? What's wrong with him??	[]
Other	8	0	It's his time. It's ...running out.	[]
Other	5	0	Well, what does he need?	[]
Other	6	0	He needs to have more time.	[]
Other	4	0	What can we do?	[]
Other	17	0	Well, I suppose we could try a time transplant. I'll have to call in a specialist.	[]
Other	15	0	It's going to be okay, baby. We're going to get you more time.	[]
Cartman	6	1	Ey Kenny! God-damn you, Kenny!	['damn']
Chef	3	0	Hello there, children.	[]
Stan	11	0	Chef, Cartman is in the hospital. They think he might die.	[]
Kyle	12	0	Yeah, and, we don't know whether or not we should care.	[]
Chef	6	0	Well what's wrong with him?	[]
Stan	19	0	Well, nobody seems to know, but we think it's because he drank Kenny's soul four weeks ago.	[]
Kyle	17	0	Kenny's ashes were in an urn, and Cartman drank it, thinking it was chocolate milk mix.	[]
Chef	10	0	Children, why didn't you tell me about this sooner?	[]
Kyle	14	0	Well like we said, we didn't know whether or not we should care?	[]
Chef	23	0	Well, you should. Cartman is your friend whether you like him or not! Now, come on! We've gotta get to that hospital!	[]
Other	7	0	He's looking a little better today.	[]
Other	17	0	Yes, but his time is still getting weaker. It will give out soon unless we do something.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Hey you guys! How's it goin'?	[]
Chef	1	0	Cartman?	[]
Stan	4	0	No, that's Kenny.	[]
Cartman	8	2	What the hell are you assholes doing here?!	['hell', 'assholes']

Chef	11	0	Oh my God! Eric, how long have you been channelin' Kenny?	[]

Other	6	0	Let's not validate his delusions.	[]
Chef	11	0	Kenny? Kenny, do you know what you need to get free?	[]
Cartman	4	0	He's gone again.	[]
Chef	19	0	Ms. Cartman, we need to get Cartman to a meeting room to speak with people who have crossed over.	[]
Other	12	0	What?? That's preposterous! What this child needs is a time transplant!	[]
Chef	17	0	This hospital isn't gonna do any good. We need to take him to see John Edward.	[]
Stan	22	0	Hey, I've seen that guy. He has a TV show where he brings people on and talks to their dead relatives.	[]
Chef	12	0	That's right. We have to go see him in New York.	[]
Other	27	0	I warn you, Ms. Cartman. Your son's time could give out at any minute. He needs to be kept here where his time could be monitored.	[]
Other	29	0	Oooh, what should I do? I'm playing roulette with my child's life!  Ooo wait, Hairspray is showing in New York, isn't it? Let's go there.	[]
Chef	17	0	Good. You children need to come too. Eric needs all the support he can get right now.	[]

Cartman	8	0	Ha-heheheh.  That was Kenny laughing, not me.	[]
Chef	5	0	This must be the place.	[]

Other	8	0	Okay, now I'm getting that Kenny ...died?	[]
Stan	4	0	We told you that.	[]
Other	37	0	And, and this wasn't, this wasn't a good death. It was like a, it was a sad death. It was like a, it was like a death that made people sad. Does that make sense?	[]
Kyle	2	0	Yee-yeah.	[]
Other	6	0	Oh, wow, that's incredible! Wow!	[]
Chef	16	0	Look uh, Mr. Edward, can you just ask Kenny how we can get him out, please?	[]
Other	24	0	Doesn't work that way.  Now, Kenny is telling me that... you're his best friends, and he's in a ss-safe place.	[]
Stan	9	0	No no, he's trapped in Cartman's body.	[]
Other	9	0	Ohh, there's somebody with him. Who's Kyle?	[]
Kyle	3	0	I'm Kyle.	[]
Other	17	0	Oh right. And uh, did an older woman pass, she's asking for Kyle? Maybe a grandma?	[]
Kyle	6	0	Yeah. My Grandma.  She's here?	[]
Other	25	0	She says there was something she asked you to do, and you're not doing it? She wants you to look for four white doves.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Oh my God!	[]
Other	17	0	Oh now she's sending me a P word. Maybe it's a puh-? Or a huh-?	[]
Other	5	0	My Harry died last year!	[]
Other	16	0	Oh, it's comin' from over here.  I'm getting all kinds of voices today.  Woo!	[]
Stan	6	0	Heh hey wait a minute dude.	[]
Other	19	0	Okay now Harry. He's telling me... oh well, he's saying that you two used to... do things.	[]
Other	2	0	Mmm-hmm.	[]
Other	6	0	And that those things involved... stuff?	[]
Other	6	0	The things did involve stuff, yes.	[]
Chef	12	1	Aw man, I can't believe I got fooled by that asshole!	['asshole']
Stan	5	0	He seemed better on TV?	[]
Chef	17	0	Yeah. They must edit his shows down on television to only show him getting mostly right answers.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Grandma's watching me. Always watching me.	[]
Stan	13	0	Dude, you don't believe that guy talked to your grandma, do you?	[]
Other	12	0	Eric?  It must be his time. I think it's running out!	[]
Chef	31	0	We've got no choice. The only people I know now who might be able to help Eric are my parents. We'll have to take the next flight to Scotland.	[]
Chef	19	0	Okay children, this is your flight back to Colorado. Your parents are meeting you at the airport in Denver.	[]
Stan	8	0	We don't get to go to Scotland?	[]
Other	11	0	It's too far and your parents want you back home.	[]
Stan	10	1	Oh well. Good luck getting Kenny out of you, fatso.	['fatso']
Cartman	2	1	Thanks, asshole.	['asshole']
Chef	15	0	Come on, we gotta catch our plane. You children get right on that plane now.	[]
Other	11	0	This is the final boarding announcement for Flight 342 to Denver.	[]
Stan	5	0	That's us. Come on.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Four white birds!	[]
Stan	1	0	Huh?	[]
Kyle	16	1	There's four white birds!  This is what Grandma wants? She wants me to attend Jewleeard.	['jewleeard']
Stan	10	0	Dude, you were going to see four white birds eventually.	[]
Kyle	16	1	So is it a coincidence that Grandma DID talk to me about going to Jewleeard someday?	['jewleeard']
Stan	9	0	Yes. Now, come on. Our plane is gonna leave.	[]
Kyle	5	0	I'm not going back.	[]
Stan	1	0	What??	[]
Kyle	16	1	I have to join Jewleeard and make Grandma proud!  Tell my parents I'll call them.	['jewleeard']
Stan	5	1	Kyle. No, Kyle! Aw crap!	['crap']
Stan	10	0	Hey, uh, I need to talk to Mr. Edward, please.	[]
Other	6	0	He doesn't do private readings.	[]
Stan	16	0	I'm not here for a reading, I just need to ask him something real quick.	[]
Other	4	0	Alright, come on in.	[]
Other	8	0	Just wait here. I'll go fetch him.	[]
Stan	2	0	Jesus Christ.	[]
Other	3	0	Here he is.	[]
Other	5	0	Ladies and Gentlemen, John Edward.	[]
Other	4	0	Thank you, thank you.	[]
Stan	28	0	Hey uh, I need to ask you a big favor. You, you did a reading on my best friend and uh, well you kind of messed him up.	[]
Other	17	0	Oh.  The John Edward show is not liable for opinions and materials given for entertainment purposes only.	[]
Stan	37	0	Look, my friend Kyle won't fly back home to Colorado. All I need you to do is just talk to him and tell him, you know, the whole talking to dead people isn't for real.	[]
Other	5	0	Maybe it is for real.	[]
Stan	31	0	Right, but it's not. It's a trick you do and I need you to just let my friend Kyle know that so he can go on with his life.	[]
Other	15	0	Look, people have the right to be skeptical. I really hear voices in my head.	[]
Stan	24	0	Yes. We all hear voices in our heads. It's called intuition. Get over yourself and tell my friend it's just for fun.	[]
Other	18	0	Look, what I do doesn't hurt anybody. I give people closure and help them cope with life.	[]
Stan	15	0	No, you give them false hope and a belief in something that isn't real.	[]
Other	5	0	But I'm a psychic.	[]
Stan	6	1	No dude, you're a douche.	['douche']
Other	16	1	I'm not a douche! What if I really believe that dead people talk to me?	['douche']
Stan	6	1	Then you're a stupid douche	['douche']
Other	29	0	I think I've had of your bullying me! Get out of my house or I'll runs upstairs, lock myself in my panic room and call the police!	[]
Stan	5	0	I'm nine years old.	[]
Other	28	1	I'm not talking to your friend and I'm not a douche!  You'd better get out of my house, 'cause I'm gonna call the police!	['douche']
Stan	23	4	You are so a douche! I'm nominating you for the Biggest Douche in the Universe award, you douche!  Son of a bitch.	['douche', 'douche', 'douche', 'bitch']
Cartman	9	0	Hey Kenny! Shut up, Kenny! You shut up, fatass!	[]
Other	9	0	Hang in there, sweetie. We'll be there soon.	[]
Other	13	0	Welcome aboard Scotland Air. Our trip to Edinburgh should take about twelve hours.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Twelve hours?? Jesus Christ!	[]
Other	12	0	In the meantime we'd like to show you a complimentary film.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Oh, good.	[]
Other	22	0	Rob Schneider is a Wall Street executive  With everything going for him.  Only problem is, he's about to become...  a carrot!	[]
Other	4	0	I'm a carrot!	[]
Other	5	0	It's 24-carrot comedy.	[]
Other	9	0	Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ohh!	[]
Other	8	0	Rob Schneider is a Carrot. Rated PG-13.	[]
Cartman	17	1	Oh for the love of Christ.  I wanna watch, fat boy!  No, Kenny, it's not funny!	['fat']
Stan	2	0	Kyle! Kyle!	[]
Kyle	13	0	Don't try and stop me, Stan! This is what my grandma wants!	[]
Stan	15	1	Look, I went and saw that John Edward guy. He's just a big douche.	['douche']
Kyle	10	1	He's not a douche! He talked to my grandma!	['douche']
Stan	36	1	Kyle, you can't ruin your life based on what some douchey psychic said. They all just use a technique called cold reading. They've used it for hundreds of years to make people believe them.	['douchey']
Other	8	0	Hey, whoa now. John Edward is for real.	[]
Stan	4	0	No, he's not.	[]
Other	15	0	Yeah. My sister told me he knew our mother's name and when she died.	[]
Other	30	0	John Edward? Oh yeah, I heard he walked up to a guy on the street, and said his dead father wanted to say Happy Birthday, and it WAS his birthday.	[]
Other	7	0	Yeah kid, how do you explain that?	[]
Stan	14	0	Alright, look. I'll show you. I just need a volunteer. How about you?	[]
Other	3	1	Oh-ho. Me?	['ho']
Stan	16	0	Okay, I'm gonna pretend that a dead person is talking to me about you, okay?	[]
Other	1	0	Okay.	[]
Stan	14	0	Okay, watch, Kyle. Uh, it's an older man, someone very close to you.	[]
Other	2	0	My father?	[]
Stan	8	0	Does this month, November, hold a special significance?	[]
Other	5	0	My birthday's in November!	[]
Stan	9	0	Right, because he's saying, Tell her 'Happy Birthday.'	[]
Other	3	0	Oh my God.	[]
Stan	48	0	See, Kyle? I just started with something really vague. I chose an older man because I'm betting that, based on this woman's age, her father is most likely dead. But if her father wasn't dead, I could still say it was some other older man.	[]
Other	11	0	Well then how'd you know her birthday was in November?	[]
Stan	49	0	I didn't. I just asked her if November meant anything. Her father could have died in November, or Thanksgiving could have been really special for them. But I go with the birthday and validate it now, as if I knew, by saying He wishes you a Happy Birthday.	[]
Other	5	0	What else does he say?	[]
Stan	17	0	Okay, I'll just use an old standard. He saying the money. Stop worrying about the money.	[]
Other	13	0	Oh my God! My sister and I have been fighting over his inheritance.	[]
Other	3	0	That's amazing.	[]
Stan	20	0	No it isn't! When a father dies, inheritance is usually an issue, and money is something everyone worries about.	[]
Other	6	0	That sounds a little too coincidental.	[]
Other	13	0	Yes. There's only one explanation. This kid can communicate with the dead!	[]
Other	1	0	Wow!	[]
Stan	1	0	What?!	[]
Other	9	0	Do me next. I wanna talk to my mother.	[]
Other	7	0	Can you try to reach my grandfather.	[]
Stan	2	0	No wait.	[]
Other	13	0	You have to tell me if my sister's in a good place.	[]
Other	6	0	Yeah, help me out too, 'k?	[]
Other	6	0	I'm next. I'm next.	[]
Other	6	0	Hey, get out of my way!	[]
Other	2	0	Do me!	[]
Other	12	0	Kid, how would you like your own talking to the dead show?	[]
Chef	2	0	Hi Pop.	[]
Other	10	0	Junior! Aw, son, it's good to see you now.	[]
Chef	6	0	These are my friends, the Cartmans.	[]
Other	25	0	Well come on in out of the cold now.  There's heavy fog on the moors tonight.  Well, look what the cat dragged in, Nelly.	[]
Other	5	0	Oh, my baby come home!	[]
Chef	2	0	Hi, Momma!	[]
Other	9	0	Lord, I thought you wasn't comin' till nine.	[]
Chef	7	0	Mom, this is my friend, Ms. Cartman.	[]
Other	4	0	Please, call me Liane.	[]
Other	7	0	So nice to have you here, Liane.	[]
Other	9	0	And is this the children you told us about?	[]
Chef	5	0	Yeah, Pop. This is Eric.	[]
Other	19	0	Well, let's see here now.  Mhm, mhm, mhm.  Yeup! There's definitely more than one children in there.	[]
Other	2	0	Oh dear.	[]
Other	7	0	Nelly, you best have at it now.	[]
Other	72	0	Oh Lord, and I just put the roast in the oven, too.  Ain't gonna have no time now to baste it. Don't nobody blame me, a woman can't bake no roast and do everything else at the same time.  Can't say that the roast is gonna be terrible, maybe just a little dry.  But I suppose we can make some extra gravy to take the dryness out later.	[]
Other	8	0	Alright, children, stand up on this chair now.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Right now?	[]
Other	3	0	Yes, right now.	[]
Other	5	0	Na kamaa karash meh nah-	[]
Cartman	5	0	Whoa, whoa, watch it lady.	[]
Other	6	0	Come out now. Come out now.	[]
Other	10	0	Just stay still, Eric. Mom knows what she's doing.	[]
Other	7	0	You all come out of there now.	[]
Other	19	0	At a vary young age one young boy learned he had a special gift. This is The Other Side.	[]
Stan	42	0	Okay, listen to me. Listen very carefully.  This is a trick that I am doing. Okay? Watch. All I'm gonna do is say a name that I'm gonna pick at random. Okay?  They want me to acknowledge Pete, or Peter.	[]
Other	4	0	Yes! Yes, my Peter!	[]
Other	1	0	Wow!!	[]
Stan	48	0	No! Stop clapping! All I did was pick a random name and wait for somebody in the audience to give a response. Now that I see that there's a lone woman crying, my instinct tells me Peter was her husband. So I say, Peter was your husband?	[]
Other	6	0	Yes, yes! Yes, my husband Peter!	[]
Other	1	0	Wow!!	[]
Other	2	0	Oh wow!	[]
Stan	7	0	Stop it! I didn't do anything!	[]
Other	5	0	You knew Peter was dead!	[]
Stan	86	0	I didn't start by saying Peter is dead! I started by saying, They want me to acknowledge Peter. That could have meant Peter was in the audience or that Peter was somebody's friend, or Peter had died. I couldn't be wrong, see? Now, I can look at this woman and see that she's fairly young, so odds are her husband was fairly young when he died. So I can say something like, I'm getting that Peter's death was very untimely	[]
Other	3	0	Yes, it was.	[]
Other	1	0	Wow!!	[]
Other	1	0	Amazing!	[]
Other	8	0	Ask Peter if he knows my little Billy.	[]
Stan	7	0	Okay. Let's back up.  Not literally!	[]
Other	15	0	In the name of all that is holy we command this spirit be set free!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Ahh, Aahhhh!	[]
Other	8	0	There we go! We're gettin' somethin' now!	[]
Other	5	0	Come on out, spirit. Go!	[]
Other	16	0	Come on out hyow! It's safe!  Here it comes! The spirit is comin' out hyuh!	[]
Other	5	0	Oooo, that's the potatoes.	[]
Other	26	0	Well hold on the potatoes two seconds, woman!  The soul's comin' out hyuh!  It's almost done. Alright, son. Now bring me the victim child!	[]
Chef	3	0	The victim child?	[]
Other	17	0	Yeah. You know, the child that we sacrifice so we could Kenny's soul into its body.	[]
Other	9	0	Oh Lord, they didn't bring a victim child.	[]
Chef	9	0	Where were we gonna find a child to secrifice?	[]
Other	11	0	We weren't gonna ask you where you got it from.	[]
Other	15	1	God-damnit! The spirit's out and it don't have no where to go!	['damnit']
Other	10	0	Lord, Thomas, don't let it get on the curtains.	[]
Other	23	0	Rob Schneider derp de derp.  Derp de derpity derpy derp.  Until one day, the derpa derpa derpaderp.  Derp de derp.  da teedily dumb.	[]

Stan	40	0	Here. Look, Kyle. I found tons of testimonials on the Internet saying that John Edward has the entire studio wired to hear what people are talking about before the show. And, he pays actors to be plants in the audience.	[]
Kyle	11	0	You're just jealous he's a better psychic than you.	[]
Stan	13	0	Fine, I give up! You wanna stay in New York?! Then go ahead!	[]
Other	13	0	So, you think you can talk to dead people better than me, huh?!	[]
Stan	9	0	No, I don't think either of us can.	[]
Other	46	1	They told me your show is getting better ratings than mine, that you're saying I'm a fraud on your show! You'd better not ever call me a liar, or a fake, or a douche again, or else I'll sue you for slander!	['douche']
Stan	23	1	I'm saying this to you, John Edward, you are a liar, you are a fake, and you are the biggest douche ever!	['douche']
Other	17	1	Everything I tell people is positive and gives them hope! How does that make me a douche?!	['douche']
Stan	57	3	Because the big questions in life are tough: Why are we here? Where are we from? Where are we going? But if people believe in asshole douchey liars like you, we're never gonna find the real answer to those questions. You aren't just lying, you're slowing down the progress of all mankind, you douche!	['asshole', 'douchey', 'douche']
Other	27	1	I'M NOT A DOUCHE! And I challenge you to a psychic showdown! I'll prove to the world that I'm psychic and you're not!	['douche']
Stan	2	1	Fine, douche!	['douche']
Other	5	1	I'm not a douche	['douche']
Other	26	0	Well come on, the soul's in here! It can't escape now.  It's goin' to the light! Unfortunately, it's the livin' room light.	[]
Other	12	0	I'll open a window, you try to chase it out, Thomas.	[]
Other	5	0	Go on now, soul now!	[]
Other	12	0	Here, spirit, come out the window.  I'll give you tree-fiddy.	[]
Other	11	0	Now don't go offerin' the soul no tree-fiddy, woman!	[]
Other	7	0	I'm just tryin' to persuade it.	[]
Other	21	0	Well I know, but you can at least start at about two quarter or somethin'  Aw Christmas, there it goes again!	[]
Other	11	0	It's headin' for the kitchen! Aw, Thomas, the pot roast!	[]
Other	2	0	Over here!	[]
Other	3	0	Get it down.	[]
Other	8	0	Don't let it get in the roast!	[]
Other	11	0	Oh. Well. I guess the child's a pot roast now.	[]
Chef	7	0	What do we do with it now?	[]
Other	26	0	Well I'll wrap it up with some plastic wrap so you can take it home with ya. Should last a few months in the freezer.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Hey, ah I feel a lot better.	[]
Chef	4	0	Eric, you're okay!	[]
Other	6	0	Oh, baby, your time is back!	[]

Other	14	0	Ladies and Gentlemen, it's Psychic Showdown. Here are John Edward, and Stan Marsh.	[]
Other	23	1	Thank you.  Alright, asshole! I know you're here to try to throw me off, so go ahead. Give my your best shot!	['asshole']
Stan	14	0	No, I don't wanna talk to you. I wanna talk to the audience.	[]
Other	2	0	Wah-why?	[]
Stan	131	3	You see, I learned something today. At first I thought you were all stupid, listening to this douche's advice, but now I understand that you're all here because you're scared. You're scared of death and he offers you some kind of understanding. You all want to believe in it so much, I know you do. You find comfort in the thought that your loved ones are floating around trying to talk to you, but think about it: Is that really what you want? To just be floating around after you die, having to talk to this asshole?  We need to recognize this stuff for what it is: magic tricks. Because whatever's really going on in life and in death is much more amazing than this douche.	['douche', 'asshole', 'douche']
Other	3	0	Yes. Right. Yeah.	[]
Kyle	24	0	You're right, Stan. My Grandma isn't floating around, judging me and watching what I do. She's dead. Dead and gone forever.	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Other	11	0	But I do have a special power! I know I do!	[]
Stan	10	0	There's nothing special about you, dude. Get over yourself.	[]
Other	5	1	God-damnit, I'm special!!	['damnit']
Other	2	0	What the?	[]
Other	1	0	Aaaah!	[]
Other	11	0	Greetings from the Jannex Galaxy.  We seek the great John Edward.	[]
