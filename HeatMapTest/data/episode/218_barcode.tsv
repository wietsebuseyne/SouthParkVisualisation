Cartman	9	0	Scanning for Mexicans.  Oh!  We've got a Mexican!	[]
Kyle	9	0	Hey Texans! Let me through; we want a treaty!	[]
Cartman	22	0	He's trying a simple diversion tactic, thinks we're stupid.  Haha! You're gonna have to do better than that, Mexican!	[]
Kyle	6	0	Better than being a fatass Texan!	[]

Other	5	0	Honey? Honey, what's wrong?	[]
Other	70	0	It's Mantequilla. We've tried giving him everything, but I don't think he's happy. Tonight I told him he could do whatever he wanted before bed - wash the dishes, mop up our bathroom - but you know what he said? He said I need to go home. I tried telling him your home is here, Mantequilla! Tu casa es aqui! But I don't think he feels it.	[]
Other	17	0	Well, maybe if we let him paint the garage, he'll feel more like family and then-	[]
Other	23	0	No, Brian! In my heart I know it's true. He belongs with his own kind, Brian. He belongs with his own kind!	[]

Butters	47	0	So there I was, just yards away from the American border. All my amigos made it across, but I became lost in the woods. If the Whipples hadn't come along, I might have froze to death. But I'm not giving up, for I, am Mantequilla!	[]

Other	11	0	Yeah, a bit too quiet if you ask me. Gimme those!	[]
Other	20	0	Just seems like Mexicans don't try to cross into the US as much as they used to, you know?	[]
Other	67	1	Noo, they're out there, Charlie. Plottin' their next move. They'll do anything they can to get into the Land of Opportunity.  And as long as this country offers everyone a better life, there's gonna be people calmorin' to get it. It's the curse of success, Charlie.  A great and wealthy nation will always be plagued  by the needy tryin' to-what the hell?	['hell']
Other	9	0	Uhh, sir? Aren't those Mexicans runnin' into Mexico?	[]
Other	5	0	That don't make sense.	[]
Other	6	0	You're goin' the wrong way!	[]
Other	47	0	You've heard of Mexican salsa, but Mexican pride? The phenomenon is called Orgullo de Mantequilla, where Mexicans are realizing it actually is starting to suck more here in the US. The borders are being flooded with Latin Americans trying to get back to their own countries.	[]
Randy	25	0	Well, I think it's good.  If the Mexican people feel inspired, good for them. People have a right to go and be happy.  NOOOOOO!	[]
Other	31	0	But just what has sparked the Mexican desire to live... in Mexico? Joining us now is economist Mark Geiger, and Mark, we've heard of Mexican ice cream, but Mexican patriotism?	[]

Kyle	11	0	Wanted by U.S. Border Patrol?! Permission to shoot on sight?!	[]
Cartman	13	0	You guys were putting out fliers, I had to put some out too.	[]
Kyle	14	0	Butters has been missing for a week! You might have inadvertently gotten him killed!	[]
Cartman	10	0	Well then I inadvertently won the game, didn't I?	[]
Other	25	0	Do you have what it takes to join the Border Patrol? Border Patrol officers are looking for volunteers to help with the reverse immigration crisis.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Oh dude. Sweet.	[]
Other	6	0	Vamos Mantequilla!  Vamos Mantequilla!  Vamos Mantequilla!	[]
Butters	9	0	Oh uh, I'm sorry,  I don't really-	[]
Other	6	0	Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah.  Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah.  Oy!  Oy!  Orgullo!  Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah.	[]
Butters	1	0	Wow.	[]
Other	76	0	Welcome to the US Border Patrol. You volunteers are the key to keepin' this country safe and prosperous.  Every day, more and more Mexicans are tryin' to get past this fence and go back to their homes in Mexico. As border patrol officers our duty is to stop Mexicans from crossin' the border. We don't need to worry about the semantics of which direction they're going, we're just supposed to stop them!  Marcus?	[]
Other	28	0	The standard-issue border patrol weapon is the P-29 stun baton. It carries a 4000 watt charge and is your best option for enforcin' border patrol law.	[]
Cartman	7	1	This is gonna be so fuckin' sweet.	['fuckin']
Other	8	0	The baton is non-lethal, but powerful e-	[]
Other	9	0	Hey! We got some! Mexicans at 2 o'clock!	[]
Other	29	0	Let's get ready, recruits! Must be a couple dozen of them!  This is the US Border Patrol! Stop where you are! Turn around and get back to work!	[]
Other	11	0	There's too many of 'em! We're gonna need backup!	[]
Other	12	0	You're pretty good at stoppin' Mexicans, son. What's your name?	[]
Cartman	4	0	Cartman. Eric T. Cartman.	[]
Other	65	0	Dedicated. Patriotic. Tireless. These are the men and women of the US Border Patrol. They work around the clock protecting American prosperity. They are the front line in making sure Mexicans stay here and work. The border patrol is uncompromising, diligent, and cool. They will defend, arrest, and most importantly, let the Mexicans know that they are way better off here in the United States.	[]
Other	12	0	Hoy celebramos el primer dia de Mantequilla, honrando el espiritu de Mexico!	[]
Butters	46	0	Thanks everyone.  It suer has been great gettin' to know you all. You've been really great amigos.  It's really kind of made me... appreciate my amigos back home. I know they were waitin' for me, and I'm sure they're all worried sick.	[]
Other	60	0	Mantequilla, tu tienes que hacer una decision. Los Estados Unidos estan de baja, y claro, Mexico pronto sera el mejor lugar. Pero como Mexicanos, nosotros sabemos que nada es mas importante que la famlia, y amistades. Estas invitado a vivir con nosotros, Mantequilla, pero tienes que seguir tu corazon. Quieres quedarte aqui con nosotros, o quieres estar con tus amigos?	[]
Butters	11	0	...What did he say? Ah I actually don't speak Spanish.	[]
Cartman	5	0	No Mexicans detected.  Huh, nothing.	[]
Other	25	0	Let's face it: they've just about all gotten back across. No matter how hard we tried, the Mexicans all got across the border.	[]
Other	24	1	When we asked Obama to stop illegal immigrants, we didn't mean to make the US so shitty they wouldn't wanna come anymore.	['shitty']
Other	17	0	Hey! Hey wait a minute!  It's a Mexican!  I think he wants to come back in!	[]
Other	29	1	Oh my God it is!  Hey! Hey! Come on in!  Come on! Come on! Come on, it's okay!  What the fuck are you doing?! Get that gate open!	['fuck']
Other	3	0	Come on, buddy!	[]
Other	9	0	Come on now, come on! You've got it.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Wait a minute, isn't that...	[]
Butters	2	0	Game on!	[]
Cartman	5	0	Oh no you don't!	[]
Butters	1	0	AAAH!	[]
Other	6	1	What the fuck are you doin'?!	['fuck']
Cartman	8	1	That asshole is not getting across my border!	['asshole']

Butters	16	1	So then, so then the fireman says That won't even fit in my scrotum!  Yeah!	['scrotum']
Kyle	10	1	Stop being a pouty little bitch 'cause you lost, Cartman!	['bitch']
Cartman	21	1	I'm not pouting! I'm just... sensitive to fireman jokes 'cause of 9/11 and uh, uh... fuck you Kyle!	['fuck']
Butters	21	0	Boy, I'm so glad I proved I'm a good Meheecan! Hey, maybe next time I can be team leader!	[]
Stan	25	0	Ahhh, I think we'll stick with Kyle, dude. You made it across the border, but it did take you... two and a half weeks.	[]
Kyle	14	0	Yeah, you're a great Meheecan, Butters, just not a great leader of Meheeco.	[]
Other	5	0	Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...  Oy! Oy!  Orgullo!  Maaantequilla!	[]
Cartman	11	1	A Baptist priest with a huge boner walks into a bar...	['boner']
