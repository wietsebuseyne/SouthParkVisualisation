Butters	4	0	My name's Butters.	[]
Other	27	0	Driver, put Mr. Biggles in the car.  I want to find a bear costume for him. Won't he be soo cute dressed up as a bear?	[]
Other	8	0	Paris, I believe this is somebody's child.	[]
Other	3	0	I want it!	[]
Other	7	0	I don't think you can actually-	[]
Other	6	0	I want it! I want it!	[]
Other	10	0	All right, all right, come on- come on, young man	[]
Butters	41	0	Wa-I'm, Wa-I'm sorry, ma'am. I'd like to be your boyfriend and all, uh even though you have kind of a big nose, but my parents told me, never get into a car with a stranger.	[]

Other	8	0	And now, back to The Price is Right!	[]
Other	6	0	Hi, sweetie. What's the matter?	[]
Wendy	17	0	Mom, Dad, I'm growing concerned about the role models young women have in today's society.	[]
Other	1	0	Oh?	[]
Wendy	15	0	It seems that lewdness and shallowness are being exalted, while intellectualism is looked down upon.	[]
Other	1	0	...Gosh.	[]
Wendy	13	0	I think young women are being marketed to by corrupt, moral-less corporations.	[]
Other	15	0	Well, we'll get right on fixing that, sweetie. Wanna watch The Price is Right?	[]
Wendy	23	1	Dad, there's a new store at the mall called Stupid Spoiled Whore and I'm gonna go there and buy a thong!	['whore']

Other	20	0	Oh my God! Well this place is-! Oh my God!  Mrs. Polk, you're buying this stuff for your daughter?!	[]
Other	27	0	It's what's in right now. I, I can't have my little girl be the only one not in a trend; she'll be unpopular.	[]
Other	12	1	Unpopular?! If she's not a whore?!  But these are our girls!	['whore']
Other	32	1	I think it's empowering for them. I mean, sure, if a man wants to be a whore, it's normal, but if a woman wants to be one, it's wrong.	['whore']
Other	19	0	Yeah, when a man pees standing up, it's normal, but when a woman does it, it's weeeird.	[]
Other	2	0	Yeah! Right!	[]
Other	19	1	Yeah, like, when men shave their balls it's fine, but when a woman does it she's straaange.	['balls']
Other	6	0	Yeah! Right! It isn't fair!	[]
Other	22	1	All the girls in South Park are gonna be total sluts from now on, so you can just get used to it.	['sluts']
Other	20	1	Yeah. Will you buy me that purse I want over there? I'll do anything, 'cause I'm a whore.	['whore']
Other	10	0	Oh, uh-uh sure I-I can buy a purse.	[]
Wendy	1	0	Dad!	[]
Other	65	1	Nope. Wendy, I think they're right. You see, you have to believe in the rights of women. For too long they've had to live a double standard.  Oh yeah.  I'm sorry I've been so chauvinistic, Wendy. From now on you can have whatever you want from this store, I'll help make you the stupidest, most spoiled whore of them all!	['whore']
Other	1	0	Hooray!	[]
Other	14	0	Butters, will you mind telling us why you're dressed up like a bear?!	[]
Butters	12	0	Oh, well, uh, my sort-of-girlfriend dressed me up like this.	[]
Other	2	0	Your girlfriend?	[]
Other	18	0	There you are, Mr. Biggles!  Aw, I thought I'd lost you!  Promise you'll never leave me.	[]

Other	31	0	Yes, and more than three billion times his net worth. Everybody adores that girl, darling. We should be nice to her too, especially if she's in love with our son!	[]
Other	11	0	Uh, Paris, would you like to have some cocoa with us?	[]
Other	4	0	With schnapps and Scotch.	[]
Other	14	0	So, Paris, I understand you're from the prestigious Hilton family. Very nice hotels.	[]
Other	21	0	I've gotta get outta here. This place is stupid. Where am I? Oh, I wanna take Mr. Biggles with me.	[]
Other	3	0	With you where?	[]
Other	12	0	To live with me forever and ever, you dumb broad. How much?	[]
Other	4	0	How much? For Butters?	[]
Other	9	0	Butters is our son. He's not for sale.	[]
Other	10	0	I'll give you two hundred million dollars for it.	[]
Other	2	0	Excuse me?!	[]
Other	23	0	I said I'll give you two hundred million dollars for it!  I'll write you a check for Mr. Biggles right now.	[]
Other	4	0	Chris, is she serious?	[]
Other	23	0	Ah, Butters, why don't you take Paris up to your room for a little while, uh, Mommy and Daddy have to talk.	[]
Butters	14	0	Mom, Dad, I-I love you. Please don't sell me to Paris Hilton.	[]
Other	3	0	Butters, right now!	[]
Other	6	0	We aren't honestly considering this?	[]
Other	21	0	Darling, Paris is a billionaire. She can give Butters everything he wants. We'd be terrible parents not to consider it.	[]
Other	5	0	But he's our son!	[]
Other	15	0	I know, darling, but look: we have to think about the rest of the family.	[]
Other	9	0	The rest of the f- you do mean us?	[]
Other	7	0	Yes, us, the rest of the family.	[]
Other	27	0	What should we do, Mr. Biggles? I drank too much.  Oh my God, I'm so wasted!  The room's all spinny. I'm... totally passing out.	[]
Wendy	10	0	Hey, Bebe. I heard you were having a party tonight.	[]

Other	10	0	Right. Please, Wendy, you're like Class President and stuff!	[]
Other	9	0	Yeah, and you get straight A's in school!	[]
Bebe	12	0	You're not even spoiled, because your parents give money to charity!	[]
Other	33	0	You don't want to go to this party, Wendy! We're inviting all the boys, and we're gonna play Spin the Bottle, and Two Minutes In The Closet, and do ketamine.	[]
Wendy	3	0	That's okay.	[]
Other	9	0	Oh, please, do you even know what ketamine is?	[]
Wendy	1	0	Yes.	[]
Other	5	0	See? You are too smart.	[]
Other	8	0	Yeah. We have no idea what ketamine is.	[]
Bebe	10	1	Sorry Wendy. You're just not a whore. Get lost!	['whore']
Other	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Other	10	0	Hey, we'd better start inviting boys to the party.	[]

Bebe	6	0	Hey Kevin, party at my house.	[]
Other	7	0	I'd like to gargle his marbles.	[]
Other	4	0	Yeah, you said it.	[]
Other	4	0	See you there, Kev.	[]
Cartman	32	6	Dude, there's Cartman. We should invite him to the party for sure.  Fuck you Milly, fuck you Annie, fuck you Bebe, fuck you whatever your name is, and fuck you, bitch!	['fuck', 'fuck', 'fuck', 'fuck', 'fuck', 'bitch']
Butters	13	0	Huh. Didn't I... Whoa, that's the darnedest thing I ever saw.	[]

Other	7	0	Yay! Mr. Biggles, you're mine forever!	[]
Butters	37	0	Please! Ah I don't want to live with her! She snores real bad, and she has a huge nose, and a squishy thing that lives in her pants! Please! Please don't sell me to her!	[]
Other	21	0	All right, Butters, tell you what: if you can raise the two hundred and fifty million dollars yourself, you can stay.	[]
Butters	13	0	Uh, well huh, how am I supposed to make that kind of money??	[]
Other	24	0	It's called working young man! Your grandfather was a coal miner for fifty years; he never complained! Get out there and start digging!	[]
Butters	11	0	Y-yes sir!  I-I gotta... mine some coal... really fast!	[]
Other	21	0	That should keep him busy for a while while we get this transaction finished. Now, Ms. Hilton, how should we start?	[]
Other	15	0	Okay, that's two minutes. You can come out, Clyde, Bab.  How was he, Bab?	[]
Other	9	0	We had a great time, didn't we Clyde?	[]
