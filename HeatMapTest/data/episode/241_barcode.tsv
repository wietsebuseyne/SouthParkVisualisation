Other	28	0	So I cast my body into the trails of blood. The knife pierces deep, deep into my lonely eyes. So I can see this black world... no more.	[]
Other	6	0	Whoa... That's pretty hardcore._	[]
Other	7	0	That's real pain right there._	[]

Other	5	0	Shut up, Mom! Go away!	[]
Other	17	0	Oh, but remember, Daddy wanted to talk to you in the living room, my dark little princess.	[]

Other	17	0	Henrietta, as you know, your mother and I have been concerned about your behavior for some time.	[]
Other	6	0	Are we really doing this again?!	[]
Other	36	0	We've had a hard time coping with the dark things you're into, but we've finally had some counseling, and apparently we're not the only parents who have a child that is... emo.	[]
Other	1	0	What?!	[]
Other	13	0	But Daddy and I_love_our little muffin, even if she's emo or not.	[]
Other	14	2	I'm not a fucking emo! Don't you even know the fucking diff!	['fucking', 'fucking']
Other	12	0	Do you know how your foul language breaks your mother's heart?	[]

Other	9	0	So listen, sweetie, we've found a camp._	[]
Other	1	0	Noo...	[]
Other	19	0	A camp which is for troubled kids like you, and you get to work outside and learn about responsibility.	[]
Other	8	1	I'm not going to any fucking camp!	['fucking']
Other	20	0	It's for two weeks, and when you come back we can talk about earning back some of your privileges.	[]
Other	42	2	I won't come back because I'll be fucking dead. I'll walk out of that camp and I'll walk the streets until I probably get picked up and gangbanged by criminals until I'm bleeding out my fucking eyes!!	['fucking', 'fucking']

Other	6	0	Oh my God, for two weeks?	[]
Other	6	0	Is she at the camp now?	[]
Other	39	0	I don't know.__She texted from the bus they put her on, then she said she wasn't even allowed to have her cell phone where she was going. Then all of a sudden her texts went dark.	[]
Other	1	0	Whoa...	[]
Other	5	1	That's fucking creepy man.	['fucking']
Other	17	0	I just can't believe it. I can't believe parents would do that to their child.	[]
Other	14	0	Alright now, you say that you witnessed your friend being abused by her parents.	[]
Other	6	0	Yes. They called her an emo.	[]
Other	5	0	What's wrong with that?	[]
Other	8	1	Emos suck! Their vile, self-pitying, depressed assholes!	['assholes']
Other	9	0	So, why do you think they called her that?	[]
Other	13	0	Because she's Goth, and some ignorant people don't know the difference!	[]
Other	2	0	What_is_the difference?	[]
Other	7	0	Oh my God! They're totally different!	[]
Other	3	0	Okay, different how?	[]
Other	20	0	They're achm, you know, one is good and an' emos are horrible!__You're, you know... They're posers!	[]
Other	5	1	Emos suck my Goth balls.	['balls']
Other	28	2	Alright alright, think of it this way: a goth believes that deep down the world is totally fucked up. But an_emo_thinks that deep down,_they_are totally fucked up.	['fucked', 'fucked']
Other	7	0	That's not much of a difference.	[]
Other	6	1	That's a huge fucking difference!	['fucking']
Other	9	0	Okay okay, look, emos are more prone to suicide.	[]
Other	4	2	This fuckin' bitch, man.	['fuckin', 'bitch']
Other	12	0	But goths are more prone to be depressed that so many people_commit_suicide	[]
Other	10	0	Goth's darkness is nihilistic whereas Emo's is cynical.	[]
Other	11	0	Wait, I thought_we_were cynical. ...What what whatever, it doesn't matter.	[]
Other	5	0	No, see, you're nihilistic.	[]
Other	5	0	Oh yeah, you're right.	[]

Other	12	0	What if she comes back, and she's all preppy and conformist?	[]
Other	19	0	She's only been there two weeks. They can't have changed her that much. Can they have?_	[]
Other	4	0	Oh. My. God._	[]
Other	3	0	Hey guys._	[]
Other	8	1	What the hell have they done to you?	['hell']
Other	21	0	What do you mean? They couldn't do anything. They can't fix me. They don't even understand me._	[]
Other	12	0	Oh my God it's worse than we thought! They made her_emo!	[]
Other	11	0	Has she said one word to either one of you guys?	[]
Other	11	0	Nothing. It's like she's a totally different person._	[]
Other	20	1	She won't even look at us. All she does now is hang out with the douchebag emo kids._	['douchebag']
Other	8	0	God, PE class is for such wannabe posers.	[]
Other	10	0	I'd rather kill myself than put on gym shorts.	[]
Other	12	0	I wish there would just be an earthquake, so we could all_die.	[]
Other	8	0	Uugh, how could she hang out with them??	[]
Other	7	0	There must something else going on here.	[]
Other	6	0	Not now Mom! I'm suicidal!	[]
Other	8	0	It's not your mom, it's me.	[]
Other	3	0	Oh, hey._	[]
Other	9	0	What did they do you you? At that camp?	[]
Other	10	1	What do you mean? Just the usual group therapy crap.	['crap']
Other	17	0	Don't take this the wrong way, but I think that place turned you into an emo.	[]
Other	18	0	That's ridiculous. I'm not anything. I don't fit in anywhere. I'm not emo, okay?	[]
Other	50	0	Then why are you listening to Sunny Day Real Estate?__I was thinking, maybe they just made you confused at that place. Maybe they didn't know what they were doing. But then I started thinking, maybe that place... turned you emo on purpose. Like maybe they_knew_what they were doing.	[]
Other	7	0	You should probably stop digging for answers.	[]
Other	1	0	What?!	[]
Other	18	0	There's no winning this for you.__Soon the entire world will be emo. It is our time.	[]

Other	3	0	Are you crazy?	[]
Other	5	0	What choice do we have?!	[]
Other	20	0	The Vampires are our sworn enemy. We beat up their leader, and burned down their lair. Don't you remember?	[]
Other	27	0	Yeah I remember. And it may be a suicide mission, but we have to walk right in the middle of the Vampires, and ask them for help.	[]

Other	14	0	That blonde Emo is Sarah Collins. She was a Vamp kid two weeks ago.	[]
Other	15	1	You want me to go in there and waste these mothafuckas?! I'll do it!	['mothafuckas']
Other	20	0	We can't just go in there and kick their asses. We have to stop this thing at its source.	[]
Other	28	0	Indeed. If there is some kind of black magic at work creating these monsters, then we will have to use our most powerful Vampiric abilities to stop it.	[]
Other	3	0	Do you mean?	[]
Other	34	0	Yes, my child of darkness. We must call upon the powers of the Vamp kids' most sacred entity, per se. Only he can help us in this darkest time. This calls... for a summoning.	[]
Other	53	0	We call upon the creator of all that is dark! The godfather of Death and Despair! Edgar Allan Poe, your followers in darkness beg for your help!__We summon to the world of the living the great Edgar Allan Poe! Knower of all that is misery! Your children need special guidance! Per se.	[]
Other	14	0	This, is your plan?! Try to summon Edgar Allan Poe back from the dead?!	[]
Other	8	0	Edgar Allan Poe was the original Vamp kid.	[]
Other	14	0	No, he was the original Goth, but he'd been dead for 150 years!	[]
Other	15	1	Ey, look man! All genres of Gothic subcultures are derivatives of Poe's work. Muthafucka!	['muthafucka']

Other	4	1	Holy shit look!_	['shit']

Other	10	0	Why have the living summoned me from my rest?_	[]
Other	26	0	Uhhhhh okayokay, listen: there's this camp for troubled kids, right? Only they aren't helping kids, they're, they're purposefully turning them into Emos.	[]
Other	10	0	Emos? ...Ew-oh my God, Emos are such wannabe conformists.	[]
Other	3	0	Yeah, oh yes!	[]
Other	1	0	Right!	[]
Other	27	2	Children of Darkness, I would help you, but I fear I cannot be seen with a bunch of douchey Vamp kids and their poser-ass plastic fangs.	['douchey', 'ass']
Other	2	0	Thank you!	[]
Other	1	0	Hey!	[]
Other	16	0	I'm just saying it's nice to know that Edgar Allan Poe agrees wth us.	[]

Other	7	1	Ah ah! He got you there, nigga!	['nigga']
Other	16	0	Okay, look, we're running out of time. You have to help us stop the Emos.	[]
Other	17	0	Why should I? Just 'cause you summoned me doesn't mean you're the boss of me!	[]
Other	6	0	Uh, yeah, it kind of does.	[]
Other	10	0	Oh okay, Mom. Let's go fight the Emos, Mom.	[]

Other	10	0	Shhhhh.__It's best you don't upset them._	[]
Other	8	1	What the hell are you doing to people?!	['hell']
Other	52	0	Not me. I just work for them. They're not evil, you know? They're just misunderstood. All I do is help the Emos get into their human hosts. They promised me when they take over Earth I can have a cabin on the lake, and all the steak I can eat.	[]
Other	7	0	Wait a minute. Emos are plants?_	[]
Other	39	0	Shhh, shhh, it's okay. Not just any plants. They're very unique. Very special. Nobody undertands them. Emoclarus americanus. Wonderful species._Except for their tendencies of self-mutilation and the need for other species to acknowledge their pain.	[]
Other	7	0	Oh, it all makes sense now!_	[]
Other	27	0	Oh! I'm sorry. Sorry, Emo King.__Oh no, I wasn't talking to him. I mean, I was, but- Y-yes! Yes, I understand.__Right away.	[]

Other	17	0	Alright, listen up. Once we find our friend, we've gotta torch the place and get out.	[]
Other	9	0	Dude, Edgar, can you not smoke in the car?	[]
Other	15	0	You can't tell me what to do! Who elected you the mayor of me?!	[]
Other	8	0	Cut it out, Edgar! It's annoying everybody!	[]
Other	20	0	God, you guys are so lame!__And if you want my help, you'd better all stop calling me Edgar.	[]
Other	7	0	Well that's_your name, isn't it?	[]
Other	19	0	That's the name my stupid parents gave me! I like to be called by my Goth name: NightPain	[]
Other	2	0	Oh God...	[]
Other	5	0	What? You guys are posers!	[]

Other	14	0	If one of us is a traitor, it's probably your wannabe vampire leader.	[]
Other	4	1	Oh, fuck off, NightPain.	['fuck']
Other	3	0	Make me, poser.	[]
Other	3	0	Michael?! You here?	[]
Other	8	0	I feel like we're being watched._	[]
Other	5	0	Dude! Michael, are you okay?	[]
Other	22	0	Kick it over! Stop the plant!__Oh! Oh, thank God you're here. Emos are plants and they're invading human bodies.	[]
Other	20	0	Alright, we're gonna get you out of here, and then we're gonna burn this whole place down._	[]
Other	12	0	I'm sorry, but I'm afraid that's not the plan.	[]
Other	13	0	You did very good. The emo plants are very pleased with your dedication.	[]
Other	16	0	Firkle! All this time I thought you were Goth! How long have you been Emo?_	[]
Other	16	0	Don't you see we can't stop them? We might as well join' em._	[]
Other	15	0	Yes Emo King, right away.__The Emo King wants us to proceed at once._	[]
Other	7	0	Ugh! Let us go, you ultimate conformists!	[]
Other	10	0	Don't fight it. It's quicker that way._	[]
Other	8	0	Oh God! I'm starting to feel Emo.	[]

Other	21	0	Wait a minute. What is this?__This says it was bought at Lowe's Home and Garden for $29.95._	[]
Other	5	0	Lowe's Home and Garden?	[]
Other	3	0	Hey, these_are_just plants.	[]
Other	6	0	No they, they talk to me.	[]

Other	19	0	Howard, did you suspect at all that a gardener job at a camp for troubled teens was a setup?	[]
Other	6	0	No, they really had me convinced!	[]
Other	28	0	And you didn't suspect anything when we had plants tell you to turn Goths and Vamp kids into Emos when really they're exactly the same thing?	[]
Other	13	0	I guess I should have figured it out. I'm an idiot._	[]
Other	21	0	Tune in again next week, when we make a woman from Milwaukee think she's working at a haunted abortion clinic.	[]
