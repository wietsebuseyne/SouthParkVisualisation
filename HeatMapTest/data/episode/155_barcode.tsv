Cartman	73	2	This picture I like to call The Pierre. I invited Butters to stay the night, and while he was sleeping I made a mustache on his face with cat poo. Hahahahaha.  And this time, when Butters stayed the night, I put a tampon in his mouth.  I call this picture The Sleeping Menstrual.  This one, I call Hot Fudge Mondae.  I really like how the light plays with the background on this one.	['poo', 'tampon']
Kyle	9	0	Is this all you brought us here to see?	[]
Cartman	64	1	Oh no, there's much more.  Let's see- Oh yes, look at this one: I call it New Moon Rising.  I did a whole study using my ass.  Here it is using some high-contrast stuff.  trying out some... different light filters here.  But this is nothing compared to what I have planned. Because tonight... is going to be my coop de grass.	['ass']
Kyle	5	0	Butters is staying over tonight?	[]
Cartman	11	0	Yes. And tonight, while Butters is asleep, I am going to-	[]
Butters	2	0	Hey, fellas!	[]
Cartman	12	0	Heh!  Oh, oh hey, Butters!  I wasn't expecting you so soon.	[]
Butters	20	0	Yeah.  I finished my chores so I came over a little early.  Hey! Are you guys all sleepin' over too?	[]
Cartman	11	0	No no, these guys were just leaving.  weren't you guys?	[]
Stan	5	0	Come on, let's go.	[]
Kyle	9	0	Wait, wai- I can't let this happen.  Butters.	[]
Butters	2	0	Yeah Kyle?	[]
Kyle	17	0	Don't you think it's a little strange that Cartman keeps asking you to stay over?	[]
Cartman	1	0	Kyyyle!	[]
Butters	5	0	Uh what do you mean?	[]
Kyle	4	0	I mean, that if-	[]
Cartman	29	0	What he means is that he's jealous that you've taken his place as my new best friend! But grow up, Kyle! Change is a part of life.	[]
Butters	5	0	Heh yeah, grow up, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Hrrugh!	[]
Butters	19	0	So what do you wanna do first, Eric? You wanna play a game or just chitchat for a while?	[]
Cartman	13	0	Well actually, Butters, I think we'd better hit the hay pretty soon.	[]
Butters	8	0	But, uh-ih-it's only 6:30.	[]
Cartman	23	0	Yeah, and I'm exhausted. If you are not sleepy yet, I have some more of that nighttime cold medicine you can drink.	[]
Cartman	16	0	You guys! I got it!  It seriously! It's the greatest picture ever! Oh my God!	[]
Stan	7	0	What'cha do to Butters this time?	[]
Cartman	35	0	It was genius! I waited 'til he was totally asleep, right? And then I got my camera, and I pulled down his pants, and then I took a picture of his wiener in my mouth!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Dude!	[]
Cartman	24	0	I know I know, check it out, look.  I got his whole wiener in my mouth, see? Heheh. Oh man, I got him good!	[]
Stan	11	0	Dude, how is putting Butters' wiener in his mouth getting him?	[]
Cartman	6	1	Because that makes Butters gay now!	['gay']
Kyle	6	1	No dude, that makes you gay!	['gay']
Cartman	2	0	Eh- ...what?	[]
Kyle	14	1	You put a guy's wiener in your mouth, that makes you gay, stupid!	['gay']
Cartman	2	0	Nuh uh.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Yeah huh!	[]
Cartman	8	1	Kenny, that doesn't make me gay, huh?	['gay']
Kenny	7	2	(Ehe, that makes you very fucking gay.)	['fucking', 'gay']
Cartman	11	1	But I'm not g-I'm not gay, you guys!	['gay']
Stan	3	0	You are now.	[]
Cartman	7	0	No, no, it was a stupid mistake!	[]
Kyle	7	1	Doesn't matter. You're gay now.	['gay']
Cartman	18	0	No, it was just for a second!  What, what can I do? How how can I reverse this?	[]
Stan	3	0	You can't!	[]
Kyle	11	0	Nono wait. I I know how you can reverse it, Cartman.	[]
Cartman	1	0	How?	[]
Kyle	19	0	The only way you can cancel it out is to get Butters to put your wiener in his mouth.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Really?	[]
Kyle	8	1	Yeah. Then it cancels out the gay polarity.	['gay']
Cartman	5	1	...Shit, I gotta find Butters!	['shit']
Kyle	1	0	...Idiot.	[]
Butters	11	0	Help me, I thinking I'm falling in love with you...	[]
Cartman	1	0	Butters.	[]
Butters	3	0	Whoa, hey Eric.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Butters, guess what? I have a surprise for you.	[]
Butters	5	0	A surprise? What is it?	[]
Cartman	17	1	It's so fuckin' awesome. You're gonna be soo stoked. It's the best surprise ever!	['fuckin']
Butters	2	0	Oh boy!	[]
Cartman	2	0	You ready?	[]
Butters	2	0	Y-yeah!	[]
Cartman	15	0	Okay! Just open your mouth and close your eyes and, and get on your knees!	[]
Butters	2	0	Oh, okay!	[]
Cartman	5	0	Hang on a second here.	[]
Butters	7	0	How come uh, I can't see?	[]
Cartman	10	0	'Cause then it wouldn't be a surprise, would it?	[]
Butters	4	1	Oh uh, ho yeah.	['ho']
Cartman	16	0	All right, that's good.  Okay, open your mouth, Butters?  That's good, just like that.	[]
Butters	26	0	Hey. Hey wait a minute. This ain't a trick, is it? Why you're not gonna, eh stick something icky in my mouth, are ya?	[]
Cartman	19	0	...I swear on my mother's life, Butters. I am not going to stick anything icky in your mouth.	[]
Butters	2	0	Well okay!	[]
Cartman	23	0	All right, you ready?  All right just- okay, open uh- okay, okay, here it comes. Just sit very still, okay? Here we go.	[]
Other	1	0	Butters!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Uh!	[]
Butters	3	0	Whoa! Hey Dad!	[]
Other	5	0	Butters! What are you doing?!	[]
Butters	5	0	I'm getting a surprise!	[]
Other	10	0	Oh my God! My, my only son, reduced to this!	[]
Butters	5	0	Hey. Where'd Eric go?	[]
Other	10	0	Butters, how long have you been doing stuff like this?	[]
Butters	2	0	Like what?	[]
Other	32	0	Don't lie to me, Butters! I know your secret now! No wait, wait. It's okay. It's okay, Butters. This isn't a serious problem. You're just bi-curious.	[]
Butters	4	0	What's... bi-curious?	[]
Other	20	0	You are. Just harmless curiosity, and it doesn't mean anything. We just need to get you some help, Butters.	[]
Other	6	0	What's going on, you two?	[]
Butters	9	0	Nothin' Mom, I'm just a little bi-curious.	[]
Other	23	0	Father Maxi, I... just don't know where else to turn. You see, I've just learned that my son is... bi-curious.	[]
Other	8	0	Is that true, son? Are you feeling... confused?	[]
Butters	6	0	...Yeah, I'm pretty confused alright.	[]
Other	2	0	You see?	[]
Other	23	0	Young man, These confused feelings that you're having are simply the Devil's way of trying to get a hold of you.	[]
Butters	1	0	Really?	[]
Other	5	0	What can I do, Father?	[]
Other	34	0	There is a special camp where young men who are confused, like your son, can go and be cleansed by the power of God. Many bi-curious boys come out the camp completely cured.	[]
Other	19	0	A secluded camp where lots of bi-curious boys are all put together? That sounds like a good idea.	[]
Butters	3	0	Whoa boy! Camp!	[]
Cartman	11	0	Haahaahahaha!  Very funny! I suppose you really think you got me!	[]
Kyle	6	0	What are you talking about, fatass?	[]
Cartman	25	1	I checked on the Internet, Kyyyle, and getting Butters to put my wiener in his mouth wouldn't make me not gay like you said!	['gay']
Kyle	5	0	You figured that out, huh?	[]
Cartman	45	1	That's right. And I also learned from the Internet that just because I put Butters' wiener in my mouth doesn't mean I'm gay! All I have to do is throw away the picture, forget it ever happened, and nobody will ever know.	['gay']
Kyle	3	0	Except for us.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Right, except for you.	[]
Kyle	6	0	And all the people we tell.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Why would you tell anybody?	[]
Stan	6	0	Because it's really, really funny.	[]
Cartman	17	0	...It's not that funny. There's lots, there's lots of things that are way funnier.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Like what?	[]
Cartman	23	2	Liiike... a tampon... in the school cafeteria... in, in somebody's lunch.  Liiike, a, a dog crap... on, on a guy's face!	['tampon', 'crap']
Stan	4	0	That isn't funny.	[]
Cartman	17	0	Yes it is! Now you guys, I'm getting pissed off! You'd better not tell anybody!	[]
Kyle	8	0	Well, maybe we will, maybe we won't.	[]
Cartman	43	0	Fine! Whatever! You guys don't have any proof I put Butters' wiener in my mouth! It will be your word against mine! And we all know that everyone trusts me way more than you guys!  You guys, please don't tell anybody.	[]
Kyle	20	0	Okay. We won't tell anybody as long as you are super nice to us, every day, from now on.	[]
Cartman	59	0	Oh right, like that's possible! Alright, fine! You know what I'm gonna do, Kyle?! I'm gonna go home, and photo shop the picture so that it is your face with Butters' wiener in his mouth here! And if ANY of you say anything to anybody, I'll simply show them the picture of Kyle.  Haha, hahahaha!	[]
Other	8	0	Everyone, say hello to our new camper, Butters.	[]
Other	6	0	Hi Butters. Hello. Hi. Hello Butters.	[]
Other	8	0	Thank you so much for taking him in.	[]
Other	19	0	Don't worry. Your son just needs to learn that he can be straight if he chooses to be.	[]
Other	10	0	Do you know why you're here at camp, Butters?	[]
Butters	5	0	Because I'm bi-curious?	[]
Other	123	0	That's right. Like all the campers here, you're confused, and you don't think there's a way out. But even though some people would have you believe you can't control how you feel, the truth is that with the power of Jesus Christ you can be normal. Now, just to make sure you don't slip up while in camp we assign every camper an accountabilibuddy.  Let's meet Ryan, your accountabilibuddy.  Ryan thought he could never change. But now he's learning that with the power of Christ and prayer, he can have a whole new life.  Over this way we have the cafeteria. All the meals are served there.  Uh Bradley! How about you be Butters' accountabilibuddy?	[]
Other	17	0	Humble yourselves therefore under God's might hand, that he may lift you up. - Peter 5:6	[]
Other	24	0	Butters here is new to the camp. He's chosen to rid himself of his affliction and forge a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.	[]
Butters	4	0	I'm bi-curious.	[]
Other	18	0	Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman: that is detestable. - Leviticus 18:22.	[]
Other	22	0	That's right, Bradley. I think we're well on our way to being healed.  We've got another one: Room 22.	[]
Other	2	0	Aw, darnit!	[]
Stan	10	0	Aw man, I've got H O R S now.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Okay, my turn.	[]
Cartman	6	1	Where is it, you filthy Jew?!	['jew']
Kyle	3	0	Where's what?	[]
Cartman	6	1	You know God damned well what!	['damned']
Kyle	4	0	Let go of me.	[]
Stan	7	1	What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!	['hell']
Cartman	30	1	I went home to alter the picture of me with Butters' penis in my mouth to look like Kyle, but it was gone!  What did you do with my picture?!	['penis']
Kyle	10	0	Knock it off! I don't have your stupid picture!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Give it back, Kyle!	[]
Kyle	5	0	I don't have it!	[]
Cartman	24	2	I swear to God, Kyle, if you don't give it back right now,  I'm gonna break your fuckin' Jew legs right here!	['fuckin', 'jew']
Kyle	2	0	Shut up!	[]
Cartman	42	4	You shut up! You're lying, and  you two are covering up for him! You know what? You're just like Jews yourselves! Stan, you're a Jew, and Kenny, you're a Jew! You're all Jews!  OW!  OW! AAAAUH!  NYAAAAAAAAAA!	['jews', 'jew', 'jew', 'jews']
Other	16	0	The Lord is love this forWith Jesus I can just say noAnd not be confused anymore.	[]
Other	32	0	We will now hear a sermon from Pastor Phillips. For those of you who are new to camp, Pastor Phillips is somebody who has broken free of the bonds that afflict you.	[]
Butters	5	0	He's bi-curious too?	[]
Other	26	0	Not anymore. Because Pastor Phillips prayed, and by the hand of Jesus Christ, he's now completely cured! Let's hear it for Pastor Phillips, kids!	[]
Other	75	0	Helloooo campers!  Yeth, believe it or not, I mythelf used to have unclean urges, and like a lot of you, I thought I was just made that way, that I didn't have a choice. But then I realized that God didn't want me to be that way! God wanted me to be a man!  So I buckled up in my little suit and I prayed to be normal and guess what?  It worrrrked!	[]
Other	32	0	That's right, kids. You see, right now you're like a paper clip.  And just like a paper clip,  God needs to bend you, and shape you, and make youuuu... straight.	[]
Other	6	0	So you say you were robbed.	[]
Cartman	14	0	Yes. A photograph. And I know who took it! His name is Kyle Broflovski!	[]
Other	19	0	If it's a photo, what's the big deal? Why don't you just print out another one?	[]
Cartman	16	0	It's a big deal, okay?! That picture is my propertih, and I want it back!	[]
Other	6	0	Okay, what is the picture of?	[]
Cartman	5	0	Why... why does that matter?	[]
Other	14	0	Well how are we gonna find your picture unless we know what it is?	[]
Cartman	8	0	All right. It's a picture ...of me.	[]
Other	1	0	Yes?	[]
Cartman	17	1	It's a picture ...of me.  And um... what appears to be... a penis... in my mouth.	['penis']
Other	6	1	You were sucking somebody's penis.	['penis']
Cartman	26	1	No, no I was not! I was asleep, and this person just... puts a penis in my mouth without me knowing! And and took the picture!	['penis']
Other	2	0	...I see.	[]
Cartman	40	1	Yes. Now it may appear in the picture... that I'm actually looking at the camera lens and s-and smiling, with the penis in my mouth. And giving a thumbs up. But I assure you, I was fast asleep!	['penis']
Other	14	0	Well we'd have to get a warrant first, approved by a grand jury.	[]
Cartman	27	0	I don't have time for that! We have school tomorrow! And I know that Kyle is gonna show the picture to everybody during Show and Tell!	[]
Other	5	0	Well then, you're screwed.	[]
Other	17	1	You both do understand that we're trying to save your souls from eternal life in hell?	['hell']
Butters	4	0	Well sure, I guess.	[]
Other	8	0	Only through Christ can we cleanse our souls.	[]
Other	22	0	And you do know the rule which states that no impure or immoral images are allowed to be seen by the eye?	[]
Butters	3	0	Well yeah, sure.	[]
Other	17	0	So let's purify ourselves from everything that makes the body or soul unclean. - Corinthians, chapter 7.	[]
Other	19	0	Then do you mind telling us why we found this  1979 Sears men's underwear catalog... in your room?	[]
Other	5	0	That's... that's mine.	[]
Other	6	0	You know this is strictly forbidden!	[]
Butters	10	0	Ah I don't understand. What's wrong with underwear?	[]
Other	23	0	What's wrong?!  This is what makes you confused! Don't you get it?! This is confusing you right now, isn't it?!	[]
Butters	6	0	Yes, it's all very confusing!	[]
Other	55	0	This is just as much your fault, Butters! Bradley is your accountabilibuddy! That makes you accountabilibuddyable. Both of your boys' behavior has jeopardizing all of the work we're doing here to save these kids!  Right. For having contraband in your room, you will both do penance by writing scripture for the next four days!	[]
Cartman	51	1	That son of a bitch. He's gonna show everyone that picture. Only twelve hours from now.  That's it. I don't have a choice. I'm gonna have to bring Mom in on this one! I'm just... going to have to tell her the truth.  Ow. OW. OW!	['bitch']
Other	8	0	Eric? What's the, what's the matter?	[]
Cartman	9	0	I, don't, want to go to school tomorrow.	[]
Other	6	0	Sweetie, shhh, tell Mommy what happened.	[]
Cartman	23	0	Kyle, has a picture of me, and he's gonna show everyone during Show and Tell, and, everyone's gonna laugh at meeee.	[]
Other	7	0	Oh, now why would he do that?	[]
Cartman	20	0	Because, he's jealous of how much smarter I am than him. So, he's gonna show everyone the picturrrre.	[]
Other	6	0	What is the picture of, Eric?	[]
Cartman	28	0	Last time, when Butters spent the night, I was being really nice to him and I was... gonna take a picture of him for his mom to have.	[]
Other	4	0	Ohh, that's nice.	[]
Cartman	78	1	But then, right when I took the picture, Butters got really hot, so he pulled his pajama bottoms down, and then I tripped, and, fell down, and my mouth landed right on his penis, and, then I thought of something funny, so I smiled up at, the camera and gave like a, thumbs up, and, and then Kyle took the picture from me, and he's gonna show it to everybody, and make them think I'm gaaaaaaay.	['penis']
Other	11	0	Oh, there there, sweetie. It'll be okay. These things happen.	[]
Cartman	19	0	But, Mom, I've been trying to get the picture back, but he won't give it to meee.	[]
Other	13	0	It's okay, Eric. I'll have a talk with Kyle's mother.	[]
Cartman	3	0	You, you will?	[]
Butters	18	0	...but that He loved us and sent His Only Son to be the satisfaction of our sins. Neato!	[]
Other	9	0	Butters, I'm sorry for getting you into trouble.	[]
Butters	5	0	Awww, that's okay, Bradley.	[]
Other	21	0	I really want to get better. I try to do everything the counselors say, but some...how I still feel confused.	[]
Butters	24	0	Yeah, well hopefully, when we finish writin' all these verses, we won't be bi-curious no more, and then we can go home!	[]
Other	20	0	You're really terrific, Butters. I mean, I think you're great.  Oh oh! Oh God! Bad thought! Bad thought!	[]
Butters	5	0	Wuh-what's the matter?	[]
Other	10	0	I think, I, I th-, I think I like you.	[]
Butters	6	0	Well I like you too, Bradley.	[]
Other	2	0	You do?	[]
Butters	2	0	Well yeah!	[]
Other	4	0	You like like me?	[]
Butters	9	0	Sure, I like like you a lot a lot.	[]
Other	36	0	Oh God, we're both un-fixable! Don't you see we're lost causes?! We're just evil and nothing can change us! There's no other way out, Butters! We have to kill ourselves!	[]
Butters	10	0	No! Bradley! You can't leave; you're my accountabilibuddy!	[]
Other	1	0	Hello?	[]
Other	8	0	Hello, Sheila? It's Liane, Eric's mother.	[]
Other	4	0	Ohh, hello, Mrs. Cartman.	[]
Other	27	1	Um, Sheila, I'm sorry to trouble you with this, but apparently your son has a picture of Eric with another boy's penis in his mouth.	['penis']
Other	2	0	Excuse me?	[]
Other	7	0	Don't worry, sweetie, everything is fine.	[]
Cartman	9	0	It is?  Really? Oh Mommy thank you! Thank you!	[]
Other	20	0	You have nothing to worry about in school tomorrow. Mrs. Broflovski assured me that Kyle doesn't have the picture.	[]
Cartman	1	0	What?	[]
Other	12	0	She talked with her son and says he doesn't have it.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Mom, she's lying!	[]
Other	6	0	She said she was sure, Eric.	[]
Cartman	13	1	Mom, you don't know anything about Jews! They lie all the time!	['jews']
Other	11	0	Well, Eric, there's nothing more I can do about it.	[]
Cartman	40	0	Then that's it. Kyle wins. But he won't win completely! I'm going to print out another copy of that picture and show it to the class myself! I can at least rob Kyle of his final lie	[]
Other	12	0	Do you mind telling me how you managed to lose... your accountabilibuddy?!	[]
Butters	10	0	I went looking for 'im, but he runs real fast.	[]
Other	19	0	You don't seem to take this camp seriously, Butters. I've called your father in for a talk.	[]
Butters	4	0	Oh no, my Dad?	[]
Other	27	1	Do you understand the concept of Hell? Do you realize that if we don't fix you you will burn in a lake of fire for eternity?	['hell']
Butters	13	0	Well yeah, but I just don't quite understand what you're fixin'.	[]
Other	5	0	We're fixing your confusion!	[]
Other	4	0	There you are, Butters!	[]
Other	3	0	Oheh- hey Dad.	[]
Other	5	0	What's he done now?!	[]
Other	17	0	Mr. Stotch, your son is insubordinate, unwilling to change, and worse yet, he's lost his accountabilibuddy!	[]
Other	11	0	They found him! They found Bradley! You'd better come quick!	[]
Other	8	0	Oh Lord in Heaven! Don't jump, Bradley!	[]
Other	9	0	Stay-stay back! I'm an abomination of God!	[]
Other	5	0	Nono, we're fixing you!	[]
Cartman	27	0	Guess you think today is your big day, huh Kyle? To embarrass me in front of everyone?  Well guess what? I'm not giving you the satisfaction!	[]
Other	27	0	Okay students, let's all take our seats. Since it is Monday, we'll start as always with Show And Tell.  Who'd like to go first?	[]
Kyle	4	0	Ow! Quit it, dude!	[]
Other	9	0	Okay Eric, Jesus, calm down. You can go first.	[]
Cartman	87	0	HA!  For Show And Tell today, I would like to share with you some very special, very artsy photographs I've taken in pursuit of being a respected photographer.  This first picture I like to call Moods of Winter , a simple aspen grove shot in high-contrast black and white shows the brittleness of the trunks and reminds one... of death. This picture I took just as the sun was rising and this lonely man was walking to work. A statement about... all of our loneliness, perhaps?	[]
Kyle	8	0	He isn't actually going to show everyone...	[]
Cartman	5	0	And now this next picture	[]
Other	12	0	Don't jump, Bradley! You will only make god angrier with you!	[]
Other	4	0	It's too late.	[]
Butters	12	0	Bradley, please. You're my accountabilibuddy. How will this make me look?	[]
Other	10	0	You get back. You're only gonna make things worse.	[]
Other	9	0	I'm not normal. I'll never be normal!	[]
Butters	5	0	You're perfectly normal, Bradley.	[]
Other	10	0	Get back! You're just as confused as he is!	[]
Butters	46	0	All right. All right that does it!  I am sick and tired of everyone telling me I'm confused! I wasn't confused until other people started tellin' me I was!  You know what I think? I think maybe you are the ones who are confused!	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Butters	63	0	I'm not gonna be confused anymore just because you say I should be! My name is Butters, I'm eight years old, I'm blood type O, and I'm bi-curious! And even that's okay! Because if I'm bi-curious, and I'm somehow made from God, then I think your God must be a little bi-curious himself!	[]
Other	11	0	I think. I think I'd like to come down now.	[]
Other	17	0	He's coming down!  We did it!  Through the power of Christ we have saved this child!	[]
Other	17	0	Well Butters, I guess we might as well go home. Looks like you're never gonna change.	[]
Butters	6	0	No. I like bein' bi-curious.	[]
Other	7	0	Well you know somethin'? So do I.	[]
Butters	5	0	Wait. Now I am confused.	[]
Cartman	41	0	And this photograph I took of a sunset near the power plant. Note how the contrasting images make a statement about our impact on the Earth. Which brings us to my last picture. Ahem. This picture you may find somewhat... controversial.	[]
Bebe	1	0	Eww!	[]
Clyde	1	0	Dude.	[]
Cartman	45	1	Yes. This is shot at a 5.6 aperture using a low-light filter. You can see the grain from the high-speed film - there's sort of a- penis in my mouth right here - and the low depth of field keeps the background soft.	['penis']
Other	6	1	Eric, what the hell is this?!	['hell']
Cartman	29	0	What this is, is a statement against the war in Iraq. It's wrong that we still have our troops there. It's wrong! And what I think that-	[]
Mr. Mackey	37	0	Uh, Eric Cartman? We got an emergency message from your mother?  Do not show picture. Kyle didn't have it after all. Found it under your desk. She said you'd know what that means, m'kay?	[]
Cartman	1	0	...Lame.	[]
