Cartman	16	0	Alright, well maybe I can help you, you know, we can totally write some stuff together.	[]
Other	47	1	Oh, well, sure. I've never really tried working with a partner, but let's give it a sho- a sh- a-sh, a-sh, shotaroosky. Let's see... I was workin' on this: Why does a squirrel swim on its back? To keep his -nuts dry.	['nuts']
Cartman	11	0	No, that's not that funny. Let's try something else.	[]

Other	9	0	Wow, thanks Mom.  You might have saved my life.	[]
Cartman	23	0	Dude, if I'm trying to be creative, I can't eat fruit. Doesn't your mom have something more substantial to eat?	[]
Other	17	0	You can check the freezer. There might be some frozen fishsticks or somethin', if you like fishsticks.	[]

Other	32	1	So apparently more and more Americans are eating fishsticks. Have you seen this? Have you read about this? Loving fishsticks, kinda makes me wonder, you know? What is everybody, a gay fish?	['gay']
Other	59	0	It is quite possibly the funniest joke over conceived, and its origin is unknown. The fishsticks joke crosses all border, all races, all ages and ethnic groups and is slowly uniting our country. In fact, the only person who appears to not get the joke is rapper Kanye West, who becomes furious when people use the joke on him.	[]
Other	20	2	Yo, that is messed up, yo! I am not gay, and I sure as hell ain't no fish! Alright?!	['gay', 'hell']
Other	6	0	You. Really. Don't. Get it.	[]
Other	27	1	Hey man, I'm a genius, alright?! I'm the most talented musician in the world! If I was a homosexual, or a fish, I would know!	['homosexual']
Other	4	0	You're a rapper.	[]
Other	1	0	Yes.	[]
Other	2	0	An entrepreneur.	[]
Other	1	0	Yes.	[]
Other	4	1	And you like fishsdicks.	['fishsdicks']

Cartman	19	0	And then it was on Leno and the Jimmy Kimmel show! Dude, that's our joke on national television.	[]
Kyle	3	0	We know, Cartman!	[]
Cartman	34	0	Nya nya nya nya nyaaa nya! We are comedy writers and you guys aren't! Ha ha ha ha haaa ha! Jimmy, I've been thinking: We've got to patent the fishsticks joke.	[]
Other	2	0	P-patent?	[]
Cartman	20	0	Yeah dude, there's lots of people out there using our joke on their shows. We should be getting compensated.	[]
Other	32	0	Well, Eric, th-that's really not how jokes work. I mean, you know, we should just be... happy that the joke is so popular and made a lot of people laugh.	[]
Cartman	34	1	Dude, fuck that! Maybe you were writing jokes for people's amusement, but I don't work for free. I'm gonna talk to a lawyer so we get what's coming to us!	['fuck']
Kyle	11	0	Jimmy, exactly what part of the fishsticks joke did Cartman write?	[]
Other	12	0	Well, he didn't actually... write any of it. He just uh...	[]
Kyle	16	0	Let me guess: you wrote the joke, and Cartman just laid on the couch eating Twizzlers.	[]
Other	5	0	Actually it was potato chips.	[]
Kyle	18	2	I knew it! Don't let that fat turd walk all over you, Jimmy! Stand up for yourself!	['fat', 'turd']
Other	11	0	W-well, I-I mean he, he was in the room.	[]
Craig	5	0	Then just give him half.	[]
Kyle	1	0	What?	[]
Craig	20	0	I like you Jimmy, but you're not gonna win this. Consider yourself lucky he's only asking for half.	[]
Kyle	16	0	Craig, if Cartman didn't do anything, then he doesn't deserve any of the credit!	[]
Craig	11	0	Yep. And if I had wheels, I'd be a wagon.	[]
Kyle	39	0	No dude, screw that! Jimmy, if Cartman didn't write the joke, then definitely don't sign any patent papers with him! Just say Cartman, you didn't have anything to do with this joke and you know it!	[]
Craig	4	0	Just give him half.	[]
Other	50	0	There are a lot of people out there making up rumors about me that are malicious and untrue. But I'm going to prove once and for all: I'm not a fish. Because I am a genius, I've ascertained that fish have gills.  Doctor, do I have gills?	[]
Other	5	0	He does not have gills.	[]
Other	39	1	You hear that? No gills! So I can't be a fish. And I'm a genius voice of a generation so I'm not gay! So that is that! Alright?! It's over! Now are there any questions?	['gay']
Other	4	0	Do you like fishsticks?	[]
Other	2	0	Love 'em!	[]
Other	5	1	You're a gay fish.	['gay']
Other	5	0	No I'm not- AAAARGH!	[]
Other	48	0	Alright, recently... Recently we've all come to know the fishsticks joke as probably the funniest, most awesome joke ever, but who originally came up with it? Well here's your answer. Joining us tonight, the brains behind the incredible fishsticks joke, the one and only Carlos Mencia.	[]
Other	4	0	Yeheah, Vive la Mexico!	[]
Other	26	0	So Carlos, you've got a show on Comedy Central, a stand-up tour, where did you have time to come up with this classic joke?	[]
Other	82	1	Well you know I just kicking it with my homies and my brain, you know, my brain is always so full of ideas 'cause I'm so fonny and stuff, so I was just all like, Hey, Papito, you like fishsticks? And my homeboy says Yeah Carlos you know, you're so funny! And then it just occurred to me. I said, Oh man, you must be a gay fish, homes!  And this is how I came up with it, my amigos!	['gay']
Cartman	1	1	Motherfucker!	['motherfucker']
Cartman	13	0	Jimmy, dude, did you see?! Carlos Mencia is taking credit for our joke!	[]
Other	1	0	Really?	[]
Cartman	38	0	Yeah dude. I told you this would happen. Now look, I got a lawyer to draw up some patent papers. We've got to sign these so that people know that the joke belongs to you and me!	[]
Other	18	0	Aahhm, I don't know, Eric. I really don't think I want to sign that very much.	[]
Cartman	14	2	But Jimmy, some fat turd is taking credit for something he didn't do!	['fat', 'turd']
Other	25	0	Well, to be perfectly f-f-f-frank, Eric, I think I came up with a little bit more of the joke than you did.	[]
Cartman	1	0	What?!	[]
Other	17	0	Well, you know, I mean, I basically wrote the thing, and you just kind of ate chips.	[]
Cartman	16	0	Jimmy, that's messed up. We decided that day to write together. Don't you remember?	[]
Cartman	5	0	Hey Jimmy, wanna hang out?	[]
Other	16	0	Sorry Eric, but I've gotta write some jokes. Unless you wanna team up or somethin'.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Team up? Okay, let's write some jokes together.	[]
Other	10	0	Here's some fishsticks guys. I hope you like fishsticks.	[]
Cartman	22	1	Do we like fishsticks? What does she think we are? Gay fish?  Uh oh, look out, Jimmy, it's a black widow!	['gay']
Other	3	0	Wow, thanks Eric.	[]
Other	7	0	Is that... Is that how it happened?	[]
Cartman	38	1	Look, exactly who came up with which part of the joke isn't even relevant. We had an agreement Jimmy. And if you wanna go back on that now, well then you're no better than a Jew.	['jew']
Other	5	0	I'm... I'm sorry?	[]
Cartman	7	0	It's cool man, it's cool.	[]
Other	11	0	Here he is, y'all! Give it up for Kanye West!	[]
Other	9	1	Yo. Ungh. Yo.  Yo, whoa! Whoa, what the hell?!	['hell']
Other	6	3	Gay fish! Gay fish! Gay fish!	['gay', 'gay', 'gay']
Other	5	1	Yo, fuck this noise, yo!	['fuck']
Other	15	1	Just doesn't make any sense, yo. Why is everyone calling me a gay fish?	['gay']
Other	32	0	Kanye, look, we all think it would be better if you would just drop it. Ya-you know, I mean, ih-if you don't get it, you don't get it.	[]
Other	41	1	What do you mean, I don't get it, House?! I'm a genius. I'll understand it, I just need to break it down is all. Now let's see...  Somethin' about fishsticks... interacting with me... makes me gay fish.	['gay']
Other	2	0	Kanye, really...	[]
Other	45	2	Shut up!  Alright, now what do we know about fishsticks?  They're breaded, they're fried, they're frozen. Then under me we have rapper, genius. And gay fish are homosexual. They swim.  Is it because breaded has something to do with genius? Which swims?	['gay', 'homosexual']
Other	27	2	No, because you said you like fish dicks, Kanye! Don't, don't you get it? You see, fish dicks is a is a play on words.	['dicks', 'dicks']
Other	18	2	I don't need anyone tellin' me play on words! I'm a motherfuckin' lyrical wordsmith motherfuckin' genius!	['motherfuckin', 'motherfuckin']
Cartman	10	0	Hey Kyle, can I talk to you for a second?	[]
Kyle	8	0	Dude, get out of here! I'm peeing.	[]
Cartman	52	2	It's just... I don't know what to do about Jimmy. I'm starting to think he might try and Jew me out of my half of the fishsticks joke.  I just... need you to teach me some Jew defensive moves, Kyle. Because we really both did come up with it.	['jew', 'jew']
Kyle	7	0	You know what, Cartman? I believe you.	[]
Cartman	2	0	You do?	[]
Kyle	59	1	Yes, I believe that you believe you helped write that joke. That's how people like you work! Your ego is so out of whack that it will do whatever it can to protect itself. And people with a messed up ego can do these mental gymnastics to convince themselves they're awesome, when really, they're just douchebags!	['douchebags']
Cartman	14	0	But, I'm sure I helped come up with the joke. Didn't I?	[]
Cartman	6	0	Hey Jimmy, what's up dawg?	[]
Other	8	0	Oh hey Eric. Just workin' on some jokes.	[]
Cartman	8	0	That's cool. You wanna write some together?	[]
Other	22	1	That'd be great! I've always wanted to work with you. You're really funny and you're totally not fat.	['fat']
Cartman	29	1	Cool, thanks. Let's get to work! Now let's see... something that's a play on words, I don't know... fishsticks. You know, 'cause it, 'cause dicks	['dicks']
Other	7	0	Hey, you're really onto something there.	[]
Other	13	1	Hello Eric. Have some chips, because you're totally not fat at all.	['fat']
Cartman	17	0	Oh thank you Mrs. Valmer.  Now let's see... The setup could be... Do you like fishsticks?	[]
Other	6	0	Right. And then I say, Yeah.	[]
Cartman	11	1	So then I can say, What are you, a gay fish?	['gay']
Other	5	0	Oh wow, this is incredible!	[]
Other	3	0	What is that?	[]
Cartman	15	0	It's a dragon of some kind! Don't worry, I can save you all!	[]
Butters	6	0	Hey look, Eric killed a dragon.	[]
Clyde	8	0	He's the most awesome kid in school!	[]
Wendy	7	1	And he's not fat at all.	['fat']
Cartman	3	0	Thanks you guys!	[]
Cartman	21	1	Nnnope. No, I definitely helped write the joke. All I can hope is Jimmy doesn't try and Jew me over.	['jew']
Other	11	0	Is it perhaps that I'm fashionable, and fishsticks are crunchy?	[]
Other	7	0	Yo Kanye, KANYE! We found him money.	[]
Other	2	0	Found who?	[]
Other	17	0	You told us to track down whoever started the whole fishstick thang. We found out who, dawg.	[]
Other	37	2	Come on, maaaan. What is this, maaaan? What the fuck is goin' on maaaan?  Oh fuck maaaan, Kanye Wehhst? Noo shiiit maaan, okay look it wasn't me. I didn't really start the fishstick thing, alriight?	['fuck', 'fuck']
Other	10	0	You're just sayin' that now 'cause you're scared.	[]
Other	52	0	No man it's truuue. I stole it maaan. I took credit for it 'cause I'm not actually funneee. Come on, maaan, do you know what it's like? Being a comedian but not being funneee? Come on, Kanye, I just take jokes and repackage them with a Mexican accent, maaan.	[]
Other	21	0	Think you can make fun of me? I'm a genius! I'm the voice of a generation! What are you?!	[]
Other	31	2	Nothing! Look at me maaan. I'm not funny, I steal jokes, my dick don't work maaan. I got to piss in a plastic bag, man, I got no dick.	['dick', 'dick']
Other	14	0	I ain't gonna hurt you. I pay people to do that for me.	[]
Other	12	1	Awww shih oh no man, come on, I got no dick, man!	['dick']
Other	14	1	Now, explain it to me. Why do people think I'm a gay fish?	['gay']
Other	20	1	'Cause... 'cause you like fish dicks, man. Come on, maaan. Don't you get it? Please, just get it, maaan.	['dicks']
Other	17	0	Why- Look at me, look at me!  I love fishsticks. I love putting fishsticks in my mouth.	[]
Other	9	1	You're a- ...you're a gay fish, maaan.	['gay']
Other	58	0	Thank you, thank you very much. Well, about a week ago our country was blessed with the fishsticks joke. And ever since then us comedians have been kicking ourselves for not thinking of it.  But today we have with us the true creators of the fishsticks joke. Please welcome the comedy team of Cartman and Valmer.  Hey guys!	[]
Cartman	15	0	Hi Ellen.  Do you guys like fishsticks?  Thank you, thank you. No, really. Thank you.	[]
Other	14	0	So guys, I gotta ask: how did you come up with this incredible joke?	[]
Other	4	0	It was just a-	[]
Cartman	48	0	Ellen, comedy is like a game of racquetball, you know? You serve, and the other person hits it back. It bounces off the wall, you backhand it. And it goes back and forth and back and forth and then hopefully you've got a good joke. Thank you.	[]
Other	16	0	But guys, this joke is so... perfect. Can you explain how nobody thought of it before?	[]
Other	6	0	Well Ellen, the tr- tr- tr-	[]
Cartman	63	1	Truth of the matter is that there has never really been a team like us before. I mean let's be perfectly honest: a lot of people wouldn't work with someone who's disabled. But I see past that. I look beyond Jimmy's disabilities and find ...a bond which can unite us in comedy. Working with crippled people is really ...important.	['crippled']
Other	10	0	That's so great. And, and are you crying, Jimmy?	[]
Other	3	0	Yes Ma'am.	[]
Cartman	41	1	Ahaw don't cry, pal. You're gonna get me started. Anyway, what was really important for us as a team, Ellen, was to make sure that everyone knew that we came up with the joke, and not Carlos Butthole Mencia.	['butthole']
Other	25	0	I see. And did you know that Carlos Mencia was found dead in his house this morning with fishsticks stuffed down his open neck hole?	[]
Cartman	3	0	Uhhh excuse me?	[]
Other	12	0	Get my jet ready. Looks like we got another inning to play.	[]
Cartman	21	0	Alright, so check it out: We've got offers from Van de Kamp's and Gorton's Fisherman to do commercials.	[]
Other	22	0	It's always been my dream to go on a national TV show and talk about the c-c-craft of comedy.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Yeah, that was kewl huh?	[]
Other	9	0	Eric, there's something I really need to know.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Whassat?	[]
Other	41	1	How do you live with yourself? You know you had nothing to do with the fishsticks joke.  But you just keep pretending. How do you look at yourself in the f-f-fucking mirror?! That's what I want to know!	['fucking']
Cartman	4	0	So... here it is.	[]
Other	11	0	How do you take credit for something you didn't do?!	[]
Cartman	27	1	That is bullcrap Jimmy, and you know it! I had just as much to do with the fishsticks joke as you did!  Dude, it's Puff Daddy!	['bullcrap']
Other	22	2	Tie up these motherfuckers!  Now I'm gonna ask you motherfuckers one more time: why did you start these rumors about me?!	['motherfuckers', 'motherfuckers']
Other	16	0	Please, I wasn't starting rumors about you. I don't even know who you are.	[]
Other	14	0	Aw right. Everyone knows who I am! I wanna know how this got started!	[]
Other	12	0	Well, we, we were just talking about ideas for jokes and then-	[]
Cartman	18	0	Oh, so now it's we, huh Jimmy? A minute ago you said you did it all yourself!	[]
Other	10	0	Well I just but I buh I was, gonna ebeh-	[]
Cartman	15	0	Abebeh, abebebebebeah! We both came up with it together! You wanna know how it happened?!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Hello Jim.	[]
Other	8	0	Oh boy! It's my best pal, Eric!	[]
Cartman	5	0	What are you up to?	[]
Other	18	0	I'm trying to write jokes. But I'm not as funny as you, so it's tough.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Well, maybe I can help you. We can team up.	[]
Other	18	2	Ruh really? Wow, you would help me even though I'm crippled. You are caring and not fat.	['crippled', 'fat']
Cartman	24	1	Now let's see, how about a joke that has something to do with... fishsticks. You know, 'cause fishsticks sounds like fish dicks, Jimmy.	['dicks']
Other	10	1	Eric Cartman, you are handsome and not even remotely fat.	['fat']
Cartman	14	0	Thanks.  So, what I'm thinking is, Do you like fishsticks in your mouth?	[]
Other	3	0	What was that?	[]
Butters	13	1	Eric! Eric, you have to save us! An entire army of Jew robots!	['jew']
Cartman	12	1	Oh my God, what are Jewbots doing here?  Flame on!  Flame off!	['jewbots']
Wendy	7	1	You saved everyone from the Jewbots, Cartman.	['jewbots']
Cartman	23	1	Come on, Jimmy, we gotta go back and finish that joke!  Like fishsticks in your mouth? What are you a gay fish? There!	['gay']
Other	23	2	Wow Eric, in-credible! Too bad I'm a dick and I'm gonna take all the credit. Su-su-suck it, bitch!	['dick', 'bitch']
Cartman	14	1	Aw dammit! I guess it really was all me who came up with it.	['dammit']
Other	1	0	What?!	[]
Cartman	11	0	You've gotta let Jimmy go, it's all my fault.	[]
Other	21	0	Jesus Eric, he's gonna kill you! You won't even admit it was just me, knowing you're gonna die?	[]
Cartman	23	0	Jimmy, you really believe that you came up with it all on your own? Oh my God, wait. I totally get it now.	[]
Other	8	0	What? I, I still don't get anything.	[]
Cartman	62	0	All this time I've been mad at you, Jimmy, for trying to take all the credit, but, now I realize it's just that your ego has made you believe things happened differently. That's what Kyle was trying to tell me. That you have such a huge ego you do these mental gymnastics to make yourself a part of things.	[]
Other	4	0	Rih, r-r-really?	[]
Cartman	83	1	I thought you were just trying to Jew me out of my part of the credit, but now I realize that... some people just have egos that are so out of whack that no matter what people tell them, they can't accept the truth of who they are.  Jimmy, I owe you an apology. I realize now you can't help believing you created the entire joke, because your ego won't let you think otherwise. I just have to accept that.	['jew']
Other	6	0	Thanks, Eric, for being so understanding.	[]
Other	59	0	He's right. For so long I've considered myself God's gift to the world that I couldn't take it when people made fun of me. But they weren't makin' fun of me. They were tryin' to help me.  Boys I understand what you did now.  Untie them guys. I know what I have to do.	[]
Other	6	0	Yo Kanye! You sure about this?	[]
Other	48	1	It's time for me to stop runnin'. I need to believe what people tell me.  Let all my fans know I love 'em, but a gay fish just can't live in the outside world forever. Don't be sad for me guys!  I'm goin' home!	['gay']
Other	167	20	(Uh. Come on.) I've been so lonely, girl, I've been so sad and down. Couldn't understand why haters joked around I wanted to be free with other creatures like me And now I got my wish... 'Cuz I know that I'm a gay fish gay fish (Gay fish, yo) Motherfuckin' gay fish gay fish (I'm a fish, yo) Girl I am a gay fish gay fish (it's alright, girl) Makin' love to other gay fish gay fish (Unh) All those lonely nights at the grocery store In the frozen fish aisle feeling like a whore 'Cuz I wasn't being true even though everyone said That I had to make a switch (dead fish)...
