Other	83	2	It's like, my whole life has just been one big screw-up, you know?  I admit it, I was I was sexually lost. I was, and then I see this person on Oprah. She was a woman but then she got a sex change, became a man, but... then she got pregnant and is having a baby, which means she's still a woman all along. That means I'm really still a man, I'm... I still feel like a man	['sexually', 'sex']
Butters	7	0	Are we gonna get tested on this?	[]
Other	26	1	This sex change was a big mistake, okay?  I was on a lot of painkillers at the time and I thought it was what I wanted.	['sex']
Stan	6	0	Dude, wanna do some math problems?	[]
Other	61	4	And then, I go to the doctor, right? And I say Doctor, I wanna go back to being a man, and he says There's been too much damage. You can't go back. Where are you going to find a penis?  Whattaya mean, where am I gonna find a penis?!  I'm a man! I deserve a God damned penis!	['penis', 'penis', 'damned', 'penis']
Other	10	0	Mr. Gar- Mr. Garrison!  Could we speak with you please?	[]
Other	9	0	What do you want? I'm trying to teach.	[]
Mr. Mackey	19	0	Uh, we think it's best you not teach until you get your personal life in order, m'kay?	[]
Other	12	1	Ohhh it's so easy for you, Mackey! You have a penis!	['penis']
Other	35	0	Ooookay students, um, obviously we've had a little emergency with your teacher, so uh, while we deal with this, we need one of you to lead the class and review for tomorrow's quiz.	[]

Other	55	0	And so it appears that the local farmer's market could be soon facing complete closure. In other news tonight, a South Park bio company is coming under fire for genetically engineering body parts onto laboratory mice. This picture of a mouse  genetically altered to grow a human ear has already sparked waves of protest.	[]
Other	1	0	What?	[]
Other	20	0	But the scientists say the process could help thousands of people who've become disfigured and need ears or noses.	[]
Other	3	0	Holy Freaking Jesus.	[]
Other	41	0	Using common genetics and cartilage scaffolding, we can graft almost any body part onto a mouse and allow it to develop. Here's the mouse you saw on television.  Once the ear fully forms, it can be transplanted onto a person.	[]
Other	5	1	Doctor, what about a penis?	['penis']
Other	13	2	Well, a penis is something a man puts into a woman's vagina.	['penis', 'vagina']
Other	20	1	No, no. If I gave you some of my DNA, could you grow a penis on a mouse for me?	['penis']
Other	25	1	You don't understand: doing this stuff is very expensive. And we've never tried a penis before; there's no guarantee it would work.	['penis']
Other	28	1	I will give you all the money I have to just try. Please. Doctor, I'm a man trapped in a woman's body. I need a penis.	['penis']
Other	11	0	All right.  All right, let's see what we can do.	[]
Other	15	0	Eric, we've called you in to commend you for your role as student teacher.	[]
Cartman	14	0	Ey! Don't commend me! It's the students' fault for being so stupid!	[]
Mr. Mackey	12	0	Uh, commend means you've done a great job, Eric. Hm'kay?	[]
Other	24	0	After leading your class through review, your schoolmates scored higher than they ever had on their tests. Whatever you did really worked on them.	[]
Cartman	19	0	Oh, well, thank you. I believe strict discipline along with compassion for my students is catamite to their learning.	[]
Other	15	0	These gentlemen from the Denver County School Board have something they want to ask you.	[]
Other	32	0	Young man, word of your success as a student teacher has started the whole board thinking. We would like you to try your methods on one of our inner-city school classes.	[]
Other	27	0	These kids just won't listen to any adult teachers and, since you handled your class so well, how would you like to give it a shot?	[]
Cartman	23	0	That sounds like a chance to really make an impact on some students who need it most. How much will you pay me?	[]
Cartman	22	0	Three hundred bucks! Did you hear what I said, you guys?! My awesome teaching skill is gonna earn me three. Hundred. Bucks.	[]
Kyle	6	0	You're not an awesome teacher!	[]
Cartman	10	0	Whatever. The whole class scored super-high on the test.	[]
Kyle	21	0	The only reason we scored high was because we took the answers out of Garrison's desk! And you know it!	[]
Cartman	15	0	Yes, but whose idea was it to take the answers out of Garrison's desk?	[]
Kyle	2	0	Kenny's!	[]
Kenny	5	0	(Yeah, that was my idea.)	[]
Cartman	20	0	Oh yeah. But whatever, I'm gonna go teach those underprivileged inner-city students and really turns their lives around.	[]
Kyle	30	1	Do you know what those kids are going to do to you?! A little middle-class white boy telling them what to do? They are going to fucking murder you!	['fucking']
Cartman	12	0	Maybe he's right. I'd better be careful how I look.	[]
Other	8	0	Students, quiet! Quiet please!  Give me your attention!	[]
Other	11	0	I'll give you my attention. All night long, Mrs. Miller.	[]
Other	21	0	You're on thin ice, Rodriguez! Now listen up! The Denver County School Board has sent over a special guest teacher.	[]
Other	1	0	Ohhhhhhhhhhh.	[]
Other	20	0	This may be your last shot at graduating from high school at all! I want you to welcome... Eric Cartmanez	[]
Cartman	9	0	Hello students. I'm Eric Cartmanez.  Your new teacher.	[]
Other	5	1	What the hell is thiiis?	['hell']
Cartman	7	0	I am here... to teach you calculuuus.	[]
Other	14	0	Iii think you're going to be very pleased with the progress, Ms. Garrison.	[]
Other	2	0	Mr. Garrison!	[]
Other	20	1	Sorry, Mister Garrison. Your DNA has replicated and grafted very successfully with the mouse. And so... here's your penis.	['penis']
Other	5	1	Wow! My penis looks great!	['penis']
Other	7	1	Yes. It's a fantastic penis. Congratulations.	['penis']
Other	6	0	How long before it's ready?	[]
Other	11	0	Welll, it still has some forming to do, but fairly soon.	[]
Other	10	0	Let me see if it feels right in my hand.	[]
Other	5	0	No! Don't open the-	[]
Other	2	0	Whoa no!	[]

Other	1	0	Yeahhhh.	[]
Cartman	12	0	Mr. Cartmanez is here to make sure you all get into collehhhge	[]
Other	13	1	Getting into college? Maaan, we ain't gettin' in no college! Fuck you!	['fuck']
Cartman	99	0	How do I reach these keeds?  The reason that you think you can't get into college is because you haven't been taught... how to cheat properly! How do you think white people always get ahead? Because we cheat all the time- I mean because they cheat all the time.  This is Bill Beelichick, coach of the New England Patriots He's won three Super Bowls. How? He cheated. He even got caught cheating, and nobody cared. Bill Beelichick proved that in America it's okay to cheat. As long as you cheat your way to the top.	[]
Other	9	0	Hey, I don't wanna be called a cheater!	[]
Cartman	19	0	No no. If you cheat and fail, you're a cheater. If you cheat and succeed, you're savvyyy.	[]
Other	13	1	This is bullshit. I don't wanna waste my time learning to cheat.	['bullshit']
Cartman	21	0	Go ahead, the door's right there.  Bye-bye, have fun, we will miss youuu.  How do I reach these keeds?	[]
Other	7	1	Boys! Boys, have you seen my penis?	['penis']
Kyle	1	0	What?	[]
Other	18	1	My penis is on the loose! If you see it, just try to catch it with some cheese.	['penis']
Butters	6	0	Ow. That hurt my brains.  Oww.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Nice form, compadre.	[]
Other	21	0	Hey, I walked out of your class, teacher. Look, I don't wanna argue with you about the merits of cheating.	[]
Cartman	24	0	Who wants to argue on a nice day like theees? How about a little pickup game?  Hey paisanoo, can you keep score for us?	[]
Other	4	0	Sure thing, Mr. C.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Okay, you start on defense, amigo.	[]
Other	1	0	AAAAH!	[]
Cartman	7	0	Ohoooh, that's one to nothing, amigo!	[]
Other	2	0	You cheated!	[]
Cartman	17	0	What's the score, ese? Okay, let's go, your turn.  That's two to nothing, amigoo.	[]
Other	8	1	Fuck you, man, you can't do that!	['fuck']
Cartman	19	0	Look at the scoreboard, amigo. No matter how many times you say I cheated, the scoreboard says two, nothing.	[]
Other	16	0	I know what you're trying to say, but I still don't agree with it.	[]
Cartman	13	0	Two to nothing, ese! Two to nothing!  How do I reach these keeds?	[]
Other	11	0	What is that?  Eeeek! Eeeek!  Eeeek! Eeeek!  Stephen! Stephen come quick!	[]
Other	4	0	What is it, dear?	[]
Other	7	1	A penis is loose in our kitchen!	['penis']
Other	2	1	A penis?	['penis']
Other	7	0	Yes! It just ran across the floor!	[]
Other	4	0	Now darling, calm down.	[]
Other	13	1	Calm down nothing! I don't want that penis running through my house!	['penis']
Other	6	1	Hoh, women. Always afraid of penises.	['penises']
Other	5	0	There! There, you see it?	[]
Other	8	1	Oh, it's just a little penis, darling.	['penis']
Other	12	0	I don't care. It's probably got all kinds of diseases.	[]
Butters	9	1	Hey wait! I think that's teacher's penis!	['penis']
Other	4	1	Your teacher's penis?	['penis']
Butters	5	0	Yeah, that must be his.	[]
Other	12	1	Butters, how do you know what your teacher's penis looks like?	['penis']
Butters	1	0	Huh?	[]
Cartman	68	0	Today we will discuss one of the fundamental ways to cheat: getting material ahead of time.  When Bill Beelichick cheated for the Patriots, what did he do? He videotaped the opposing team's defense. Think of the defense as your test. When taking a test you must also videotape the defense. Learn what's on the test before they give it to you. And that way you can-	[]
Other	11	0	I thought that... well maybe I can give cheating a try.	[]
Cartman	59	0	Have a seat, amigo. Good to have you baaack.  All right. Now, when Bill Beelichick got caught with his camera, he did not panic. He simply said what every good white cheater says when caught: I mis-interpreted the rules. It's what you must also say when caught cheating! I mis-interpreted the rules. Say it with me.	[]
Other	5	0	I mis-interpreted the rules.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Good. Again.	[]
Other	5	0	I mis-interpreted the rules.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Again!	[]
Other	5	0	I mis-interpreted the rules.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Now you sound like white people!	[]
Other	5	0	I mis-interpreted the rules!	[]
Other	18	2	What the hell do you mean you just put my penis outside?! Why didn't you call me?!	['hell', 'penis']
Other	18	1	Look Garrison, my wife didn't want a penis in the house. I had to get it out.	['penis']
Other	13	0	Well now how am I supposed to find it?! It could be anywhere!	[]
Other	1	0	EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK!	[]
Other	2	1	Holy Crap!	['crap']
Other	2	0	Eeeek! Eeeeeek!	[]
Other	5	0	Carole, get down from there!	[]
Other	10	1	Noo! Didn't you see that penis just now?! Eeeek!	['penis']
Other	16	1	I'm sure that penis is way more scared of you than you are of it.	['penis']
Other	4	1	You saw a penis?!	['penis']
Other	1	0	Eeeeeeeek!	[]
Other	8	0	Oh, it's so big and disguuusting. Eeek.	[]
Other	21	2	Come back here, penis!  There you are! Got you!  Hey, you're not my penis.  Ogh!  There it goes! Stop you!	['penis', 'penis']
Cartman	6	0	The answer to #27 is 5.	[]
Other	6	0	The answer to #27 is 5.	[]
Cartman	6	0	The answer to #28 is 14.	[]
Other	6	0	The answer to #28 is 14.	[]
Other	13	0	Man, what's the point?  What's the point of any of this?	[]
Cartman	42	0	All right, uh, everyone review the section on sportscasters forgiving the Patriots for cheating and saying it was no big deal; I'll be right back.  Melita! Melita, hold on.  You can't quit now. Come on, what's wrong with you?	[]
Other	34	0	There isn't any point to all this. I won't be going to college. I'm pregnant, all right? I just found out, and Eduardo isn't going to help me raise it.	[]
Cartman	15	0	How do I reach these keeds?  All right, let's go get you an abortion.	[]
Other	9	0	No. I'm Catholic. I think abortion is wrong.	[]
Cartman	14	0	Abortion isn't wrong! What's the one thing I've been teaching you?	[]
Other	4	0	That cheating is good?	[]
Cartman	64	0	Yes! And abortion is the ultimate form of chea-ting! You're chea-ting nature itself.  Why do rich white girls get ahead in life? Because they get abortionnns when they're young. They get pregnant, but they still want to go to college, so, whatever, they just cheat. They cheat that little critter in their belly right out of a chance at life.	[]
Other	6	0	I don't know, Mr. C.	[]
Cartman	56	0	Mexicans are told not to cheat. Don't cheat! You got pregnant? You have to raise the child. So then you have to raise the child while the white girls get to go to college and probably have a bunch more abortionnns.  It is at our most challenging times that we must cheat... our very hardest.	[]
Other	12	1	And the last time you saw your penis was two days ago?	['penis']
Other	3	0	That's right.	[]
Other	4	0	Long whiskers or short?	[]
Other	5	0	Short, and little fluffy ears.	[]
Other	3	0	Fluffy ears, okay.	[]
Other	5	0	Think you got it, Mitch?	[]
Other	8	0	I think so, sir. Is this pretty close?	[]
Other	9	0	No, no, not like that! That's just silly.	[]
Other	14	0	Sir, we might wanna get a unit down to the Italian restaurant on Kentner.	[]
Other	3	0	What is it?	[]
Other	15	1	Call just came through. Seems a penis broke in and tried to eat their cheese.	['penis']
Other	3	0	Wall come on!	[]
Other	1	0	EEK!	[]
Other	4	0	What's the matter?	[]
Other	2	1	A penis!	['penis']
Other	3	1	A penis? Where?	['penis']
Other	4	0	There it is!  Eek!	[]
Other	3	0	Where is it?!	[]
Other	2	0	Look, there!	[]
Other	2	0	Come on!	[]
Chef	8	0	What'sa that peenis doing ina myii kitchen?	[]
Other	15	2	Huy! Don't you dare kill my penis!  Crap! We've gotta go back around!	['penis', 'crap']
Other	15	0	Someone somewhere is loving me tonightLooking at the same moon and seeing it so bright.	[]

Other	3	0	Feelin' my despair	[]
Other	5	0	And this same moon is	[]
Other	5	0	making them think of that-.	[]
Other	7	0	There it is!  No! Nooo!  No! No!	[]
Other	6	0	There's not a chance now.	[]
Other	6	0	No we, we can find it!	[]
Other	31	1	Sorry Garrison, your penis is gone. Afraid there's nothing more we can do. You'll just have to live with being a woman. A very ugly one. Come on, men.	['penis']
Other	60	0	Students, I want to congratulate you on your amazing test scores. The school board is so impressed with your progress that they are going to let you take the standardized advanced placement test for college credit.  The test is going to be heavily monitored in a private room at their location to assure that there can be absolutely no cheating.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Uh what?	[]
Other	8	0	The test will be tomorrow. Make us proud.	[]
Other	6	0	Monitor us in a private room?	[]
Other	11	0	Now they're gonna know we've been cheating all along.	[]
Other	18	0	I knew it man! You made us believe in your way and now it's all for nawthing!	[]
Cartman	20	0	Ih it's not for nothing. Ih, if you're good enough, you can cheat right in front of them.	[]
Other	8	0	Shut up, man! You reyally screwed us all!	[]
Cartman	68	0	How do I reeeach these keeeeds?!  Just before the last Super Bowl, Bill Beelichick gathered his football players and said, Let's win this one for real. Just this one time. Let's not cheat. You know what happened?  They lost.  Even if you feel all eyes are upon you, you cannot give up on chea-ting! Or else you can lose the biggest game of your lives.	[]
Other	8	0	Yeah, come on, we can do this, guys.	[]
Cartman	27	0	You are the true dreamers. Tomorrow you will prove it. We will begin by reviewing how to print out cheat sheets as labels for your bottled water.	[]
Other	58	4	You did this to yourself, Garrison. Get your hopes up with a stupid genetic experiment and now all your money's gone along with your penis.  Well what the?  Why... it's my penis.  My penis came back. But why?  I guess it's true. What's that old saying? If you love your penis, let it go...	['penis', 'penis', 'penis', 'penis']
Other	33	0	The standardized advanced placement test is considered one of the most difficult and carefully monitored tests in the country. Twenty-four of our students took the test and all twenty-four scored 100%	[]
Other	5	0	Uh, can we say something?	[]
Other	1	0	Sure.	[]
Other	19	0	We would like to present this plaque to the person who taught us the White People Method. Mr. Cartmanez!	[]
Cartman	4	0	I reeached these keeeds.	[]
Other	16	0	Students and faculty, please put your hands together and help me in welcoming back, Mister Garrison.	[]
Mr. Garrison	60	0	Thanks everyone. It's great to be back. I'm a man again. Thanks to my very special new friend.  But you know, I've learned that I've really been a dude all along. Because the key difference between men and women is that women can have babies. If you can't have babies, then, you're a man.	[]
Other	19	0	Whoa uh wait, uh, hang on a second. My wife had ovarian cancer, so she can't have babies.	[]
Mr. Garrison	18	1	Well then get an AIDS test, Thompson, 'cause your wife's a dude, faggot!  Yeah! I'm back!	['faggot']
