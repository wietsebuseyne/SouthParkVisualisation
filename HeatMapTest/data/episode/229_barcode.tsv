Stan	1	0	Kyle!	[]
Other	11	1	Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell.	['hell']
Kyle	6	0	AAAAAAAH! I can't take it!	[]
Cartman	3	0	Somebody help us!	[]
Other	20	0	Trapped in an unforgiving mountain wilderness with no way out.  The fourth graders are in a nightmare they cannot escape.	[]
Kyle	7	0	We were stuck. We were completely stuck.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Kyle, hurry!	[]
Stan	9	0	Kyle, wake up! You've gotta wake up, Kyle!	[]
Other	24	0	For four elementary school boys. an ordinary day becomes a descent into madness on tonight's episode of I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Oh God!	[]
Stan	1	0	No!	[]
Stan	11	0	Help! We're trapped!  We've gotta get out of here!	[]
Other	48	0	It's the last day of Spring break,  and all over the small mountain town of South Park,  students are trying to have as much fun as possible.  For ten year old Stan Marsh and his friends Kyle, Eric, and Kenny, the last day has come too soon.	[]
Stan	27	0	We really had spent the whole spring break watching TV and playing Xbox, you know, so, we, we wanted to go out and do something really adventurous.	[]
Kyle	12	0	We could go to the city pool. They have a water slide	[]
Cartman	14	0	Noo nono, I'm not getting in a pool with Kenny. He has herpes.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(What?!)	[]
Cartman	9	0	Look at his lip.  You've got herpes, dude.	[]
Kenny	9	0	(This is not herpes, it's a cold sore!)	[]
Cartman	13	0	No- cold sore is what girls call it, Kenny. It's actually herpes.	[]
Stan	17	0	Come on guys, the day is wasting away. What would be something really cool we could do?	[]
Kyle	14	0	And then like, out of nowhere, somebody came up with the idea of ziplining.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Hey yeah, ziplining! That could be really cool!	[]
Kyle	7	0	We've definitely not done that before!	[]
Stan	21	0	I think there's a place just outside of town. I'll see if my uncle Jimbo will drop us off.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Cool! Ziplining.	[]
Cartman	3	1	Ziplining. Hell yeah.	['hell']
Other	18	0	Within thirty minutes, the boys are getting a ride to the ziplining outfitters from Stan's uncle Jimbo.	[]
Cartman	18	0	We were in a good mood, just jokin' around, you know, mostly making fun of Kenny's herpes.	[]
Cartman	17	0	Hey Kenny! You got herpes, dude! Ah I almost touched him.  Zi-  Oh, sick Kenny! No! Gross.	[]
Kenny	7	0	(Dude, it's just a fever blister!)	[]
Cartman	31	1	Heh, did you hear that guys? Kenny said it's just a fever blister.  You sound like a chick, Kenny. That's herpes, dude. You got that shit till you die.	['shit']
Other	11	0	It's the idyllic spring break getaway with friends and laughter.	[]
Other	11	0	Hey, you guys here for the 2 o'clock zipline tour?	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Other	23	0	All right, let me get you some helmet and some gear and we'll get up there and hit that fresh nar nar.	[]
Kyle	27	0	And so they put us in these harnesses and helmets. I th-I think that's when we started realizing, Oh wow, this is actually pretty dangerous.	[]
Other	8	0	All right, you guys look ready to zipline!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Alright!	[]
Other	20	0	Okay, just follow me over to the waiting room and we'll have you take a seat with the others.	[]
Stan	13	0	And we were like, Other? We have to do this with other people?	[]
Other	2	0	Hi there.	[]
Other	1	0	Hello.	[]
Other	1	0	Hi	[]
Other	67	0	The boys have just made a sobering discovery.  For ten year old Stan Marsh, the realization that he will be with a tour group has caused his adrenal glands to slow down.  The average human acts a certain way when surrounded by friends and family.  But, in a tour group, the brain has to work overtime, acting nice and pretending to care about people on the tour.	[]
Other	4	0	Hey, how are you?	[]
Stan	4	0	Good. How are you?	[]
Kyle	21	0	So then we sit there for like, thirty minutes, because we had to wait for this couple who was running late.	[]
Other	6	0	Alright, our last zipliners are here.	[]
Other	6	0	Sorry we made you wait, everybody.	[]
Other	22	1	Inside Kyle's mouth, the muscles contract to force a smile, even though in his brain, Kyle is thinking, Dude, fuck you!	['fuck']
Kyle	4	0	We don't mind.	[]
Cartman	22	0	Now everyone was there. We thought things would start getting fun, but... that's when we had to watch the safety video.	[]
Other	8	0	Welcome to Backcountry Adventures! Well hey there Michael!	[]
Other	3	0	Hey there Michael.	[]
Stan	13	1	It was... I don't know, ten, maybe fifteen minutes of pure hell.	['hell']
Other	14	0	Oh, and don't forget... to take in the nar. Back to you, Michael.	[]
Other	6	0	Thanks Michael.  Anybody have any questions?	[]
Cartman	1	0	...No.	[]
Other	15	0	I have a question: Can we review the best ways to hold a rope again?	[]
Stan	17	0	Really? You're gonna make us all listen to it again 'cause you couldn't understand? Really?	[]
Other	8	0	Let's get out there and get zippin'!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Jesus Christ!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Finally!	[]
Other	24	0	The boys think their ordeal is over, but what they don't realize is that things are about to go from bad to worse.	[]
Other	5	0	Here we go guys! Zipliniiin'!	[]
Other	7	0	Everyone just step on in the shuttle.	[]
Stan	1	0	...Shuttle?	[]
Kyle	10	0	How, how long do we have to take the shuttle?	[]
Other	6	0	It's about forty-five minutes.	[]
Other	43	0	It's a devastating blow. For Kyle, it's almost too much to bear.  His brain is already lacking excitement, and now just the word shuttle makes Kyle's brain fire neurons  that bring up memories of just how lame shuttles can be.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Well, come on, we don't have a choice.	[]
Other	30	0	Alright guys, should be about forty five minutes to the freshest nar nar. Why don't we go around the van and get to know each other a little bit?	[]
Stan	4	0	Uh that's okay.	[]
Other	120	0	Well my name's Pete Nichols and this is my wife Donna, and uh... make a long story short, we came out here to see our relatives who live down in Moab. They uhhh been livin' there about twenty years now, and uh, long story short, they told us that as long as we were in the Rockies we should try ziplining, so, long story short, we looked around in the newspapers and on the Internet and... on billboooards, and... you know, make a long story short, we found this company and thought we'd give 'er a try, so then we called and, we made a reservation, and that's when, you know, long story short, we just thought-	[]
Other	14	0	It's almost three o'clock, and the boys are still on the shuttle.	[]
Other	9	0	We're gettin' close. Are you guys gettin' psyched?!	[]
Other	1	0	Wooo!	[]
Other	125	0	But what the boys don't realize is that a massie storm is brewing.  Last night, Eric Cartman had kung pao spaghetti from California Pizza Kitchen.  Inside Eric's stomach, the kung pao has just met with the Del Taco he ate for breakfast. It has already started to tear down the layers of barbeque BK toppers that have been building up for months.  And now, to compensate for all the annoying tourists, Eric is ingesting massive amounts of Mountain Dew.  The caffeine and sugar turn the soupy fast-food liquid in his stomach into a toxic gas.  When the gas is released, it carries with it tiny particles of Eric's fecal matter.  Fecal matter which floats up and into Kyle's nasal passage.	[]
Kyle	4	1	Dude, did you fart?!	['fart']
Cartman	2	0	Mmmm, no?	[]
Other	5	0	Alright buys, we're here!	[]
Stan	2	0	Thank God.	[]
Other	33	0	Alright, here we are. Looks like we got some good nar to zipline through today. Uh, but before we climb up and start ziplining, does anyone care to know about these trees' biology?	[]
Cartman	3	0	The trees' biology?	[]
Other	19	0	We are running a little late, but if anyone really wants to know, we could take a few minutes.	[]
Stan	5	0	I think we're good.	[]
Other	11	0	I'd like to know about the biology of the trees.	[]
Other	16	0	Okay, well, this is a Ponderosa pine. It covers a more extensive area than other Ameri-	[]
Stan	13	1	So after Asshole gets his biology lesson, we finally get to go ziplining!	['asshole']
Other	51	0	Alright, remember to keep your clear of the cable and just let your equipment do the work.  Now, when you're about halfway down the zipline, the camera's gonna take your picture, so when I call out Shockabra!, look up and give the camera a nice shockabra . Alright, you ready?	[]
Cartman	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Other	5	0	Ready to do some ZIPPIN'?	[]
Cartman	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Other	7	0	Alright, let's hear you say Zipliiine!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Zipliiine.	[]
Other	1	0	Shockabra!	[]
Other	4	0	Woohoo! Alright, nice zip!	[]
Kyle	5	0	Well? How was it, Cartman?	[]
Cartman	4	1	Totally fuckin' stupid, dude!	['fuckin']
Stan	2	0	Oh, really??	[]
Cartman	8	2	Yeah dude, it's fuckin' boring as shit!	['fuckin', 'shit']
Other	6	0	Alright Kyle, give me a Zipliiine!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Zipline.	[]
Other	1	0	Shockabra!	[]
Kyle	37	0	It was like having the life sucked out of you. That' all it is, sliding down a cable. Maybe without a tour group it'd be ...kind of fun. Maybe. But, this was just... a complete disaster.	[]
Other	31	0	After a grueling twenty minutes, waiting for everyone else to ride the zipline, the boys relaize they have just wasted hours of their time. And that, is when the unthinkable happens.	[]
Other	13	0	Alright guys, let's get movin'! Only ten minutes till our next zipliiine!	[]
Cartman	8	0	The next zipline? What are you talking about?	[]
Kyle	14	0	E-excuse me, w-we aren't going back now? Aren't we done?	[]
Other	10	0	This is Zipline Tours. We got sixteen more to go.	[]
Stan	5	0	And it was like WHAM.	[]
Kyle	1	0	STOP!	[]
Cartman	1	0	NOOOO!	[]
Other	5	0	Everyone back in the shuttle!	[]
Other	1	0	NOOOO!	[]
Other	11	0	The boys realize that their ziplining nightmare has only just begun.	[]
Other	12	0	Anyone have any questions about the creek we're about to cross?	[]
Other	1	0	Yes.	[]
Other	1	0	AAAA!	[]
Other	13	0	Ack went the little frog one day. Ack went the little green frog...	[]
Cartman	1	0	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!	[]
Other	3	0	Let 'er rip!	[]
Other	1	0	Zipliiine!	[]
Other	11	1	Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell.	['hell']
Other	10	0	Next zipline's up here, we call it the Terminator.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Wugh!	[]
Other	10	0	Trapped in an unforgiving mountain wilderness with a tour group.	[]
Other	15	0	But, you know, to make a long story short, I woke up this morning and-	[]
Other	7	0	Could you get another picture of us?	[]
Kyle	1	0	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!	[]
Other	10	0	The fourth graders are in a nightmare they cannot escape.	[]
Cartman	5	1	I'm so fucking bored!	['fucking']
Other	5	0	Alright, you going next, Ricky?	[]
Other	4	0	Help! Somebody! Help us!	[]
Kyle	10	0	It's no use. There's nobody around for miles.	[]
Stan	10	0	There could be a helicopter. Maybe one will fly overhead.	[]
Kyle	8	0	Face it Stan! Nobody's coming for us!	[]
Other	1	0	Zipline!	[]
Other	1	0	Woohoo!	[]
Cartman	8	0	We should have never listened to you, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Me?!	[]
Cartman	20	0	Yeah you! In the park this morning?! I know, let's all go ziplining! We've never done that before!	[]
Kyle	18	0	Oh no, don't try to pin this on me! You're the one who brought it up!	[]
Cartman	10	0	I brought it up because you already brought it up!	[]
Stan	22	0	That's when I realized nobody remembered. Nobody remembered it was me who came up with the idea to go ziplining. Me.	[]
Kyle	5	2	You fat piece of shit!	['fat', 'shit']
Cartman	3	1	Fuck you Kyle!	['fuck']
Stan	10	0	Guys, guys, does it really matter whose idea it was?!	[]
Other	1	0	Yes!	[]
Stan	34	0	Alright, look, we can make it, you guys. We can't panic. If the four of us don't zipline the tour will move faster. We are gonna make it out of here, okay?	[]
Other	94	0	But what the boys don't realize is that Eric's body is already shutting down from stage 4 diarrhea.  Inside his stomach, bile has just dislodged an Arby's Ultimate Angus. In the average human, this would only cause mild diarrhea.  But Eric Cartman is now drinking Double Dew, a Mountain Dew product with twice the sugar and caffeine of regular Mountain Dew.  His rancid feces is now rapidly converting to a thick paste.  The diarrhea shoots out of Eric's anus and into his underwear.  Eric Cartman is a ticking time bomb.	[]
Kyle	7	1	DUDE! Did you just shit your pants?!	['shit']
Cartman	2	0	Nnnn-mo...	[]
Stan	14	0	So, I just tried to keep the tour group moving, as fast as possible.	[]
Other	13	0	All right guys, this is where we're going to break for lunch.	[]
Other	6	0	Come in by the waterfall, gang!	[]
Stan	10	0	Oh no, could, could we skip lunch and keep going?	[]
Other	6	0	Skip a free lunch? Not me!	[]
Other	9	0	Wo wants sandwiches?  We got ...turkey.  Ham.  Turkey ham.	[]
Other	13	0	Long story short, we picked up our bags and went to our hotel.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Oogh! Ugh! You guys, seriously! Something's wrong in my tummy!	[]
Kyle	6	0	The stop drinking Double Dew, fatass!	[]
Cartman	28	0	This is Diet Double Dew Kyle! It only has half the caffeine and sugar of Double Dew.  Oh man, you guys, I gotta get to a bathroom fast.	[]
Kyle	9	1	You're in a forest! Go take a crap!	['crap']
Cartman	12	1	If I crap in the woods, the blood will attract beavers, Kyle!	['crap']
Stan	17	0	Hey ah, I'm so sorry, but we have an emergency. Our friend is really really sick.	[]
Other	9	0	Oh, you mean the little kid with the herpes?	[]
Stan	1	0	...Yyyeah.	[]
Other	9	0	That's not herpes, it's a cold sore.	[]
Other	2	0	Right, sorry.	[]
Stan	19	0	Yeah, his, his cold sore is really bad, and uhh he's losing blood, so we've gotta go.	[]
Other	17	0	Jesus, sorry dude, but we're at the summit. The only way down is to zip down.	[]
Other	2	0	Zipline! Wooo!	[]
Other	4	0	What about the stables?	[]
Other	26	0	Oh yeah, the stables. There's, there's a ranch right past that hill that rents out horses. I, I bet they can get you back.	[]
Kyle	17	0	Suddenly, Stan says he knows about some horse stables. Ih it seemed too good to be true.	[]
Other	15	0	Now let me get this straight: You want four horses, one for each of ya?	[]
Stan	2	0	Yea, please!	[]
Other	8	0	Well I think we can set ya up.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Oh, thank God!	[]
Stan	10	0	You see guys? This is gonna be sweet after all.	[]
Other	15	0	Step right out here, we'll get you going.  Got four more for you, Duncan.	[]
Cartman	1	0	NOOO!	[]
Other	11	1	Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell.	['hell']
Kyle	1	0	AAAAH!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Eeeeugh.	[]
Other	17	0	Trapped in a tour group on horsback that is only allowed to travel four miles an hour.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Can we please go faster?!	[]
Kenny	5	0	(I can't take it!)	[]
Other	17	0	We got some lunch set up for ya up ahead. Some turkey sandwiches and Diet Double Dew.	[]
Kyle	1	0	AAAAAAAAAAH!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Uh oh.	[]
Other	15	0	So anyway, long story short, I was born in 1953 at six in the morning.	[]
Other	27	0	An attempt to make a bad day better becomes a descent into madness on... I Should Have Never Thought Horseback Riding Would Be Any Better Than Ziplining	[]
Other	19	0	This here waterfall is called Heartbreak Falls. Would you all like to know why it's called Heartbreak Falls?	[]
Other	4	0	Well I certainly would!	[]
Stan	7	0	Kyle. Kyle? Kyle, come on, wake up!	[]
Kyle	5	0	Just go. Go without me.	[]
Stan	8	0	No, we're not leaving you here, Kyle!	[]
Kyle	20	0	I can't take it anymore.  Why do people say long story short? They're not making it short, Stan.	[]
Stan	60	0	I just sat there, watching Kyle die and... I wanted to tell him the truth right then and there. But then this... fire rose up inside of me, I... I thought I can find us a way out! I ran off and went searching for, I don't know how long. Twelve minutes? And that's when I found it.	[]
Stan	29	0	You guys, you guys! Get up! Listen to me! There's a lake a hundred yards down that way! They've got a marina with boats just sitting there!	[]
Cartman	2	0	A marina?	[]
Stan	18	0	We can take a boat, you guys! We can probably take it all the way back to Fairplay!	[]
Kyle	4	0	What's the point?	[]
Stan	18	0	Come on you guys! A boat all to ourselves? It'll be fun! What could possibly go wrong?!	[]
Other	27	1	Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell.  Trapped on a 42-foot powerboat  which is only allowed to go five miles an hour.	['hell']
Kyle	9	0	Because we keep getting screwed over by your diarrhea!	[]
Cartman	17	2	Well it's not my diarrhea's fault that you took us all ziplining, you fuckin' Jew!	['fuckin', 'jew']
Kyle	6	0	Ziplining was your idea, you fatass!	[]
Other	10	0	The fourth graders are in a nightmare they cannot escape.	[]
Cartman	12	0	Kenny, whose idea was it to go ziplining? Mine, or Kyle's?	[]
Kenny	11	1	I don't know. I really don't give a shit.	['shit']
Other	24	1	For four elementary school boys, an alrady tragic day becomes a descent into madness on... I Should Have Never Got On A Goddamn Boat	['goddamn']
Kyle	21	1	Oh no.  You're not stinking up the entire boat! You're taking a crap off the side into the water!	['crap']
Kenny	1	0	Beavers!	[]
Other	24	0	After cleaning Cartman's diarrhea and fighting off beavers, the boys have made a terrifying discovery: that boating is just as boring as ziplining.	[]
Stan	12	0	The boat went really slow and it just went round and round.	[]
Cartman	1	0	WAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!	[]
Other	14	0	If the boys fall asleep now, from the lack of excitement, they could die.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Here!  Everyone drink some Mountain Dew!	[]
Kyle	33	0	I don't know, I-I just thought if we all drank the Mountain Dew, the caffeine and the sugar would help us stay awake. I told Cartman he has to share it.	[]
Cartman	9	0	I'm not sharing with Kenny. He has herpes!	[]
Kenny	4	1	Hey.  Fuck you, Cartman.	['fuck']
Other	22	1	Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell.  And just when it seems it can't get any worse...	['hell']
Stan	2	0	...Kenny? Kenny!	[]
Other	6	0	Kenny McCormick has died of boredom.	[]
Kyle	8	1	Oh my God, they killed Kenny! YOU BASTARDS!	['bastards']
Cartman	18	1	No, not they, YOU! Look what your ziplining idea has done! You killed Kenny, YOU're the bastard!	['bastard']
Kyle	13	1	IT WASN'T MY IDEA, IT WAS YOURS! YOU KILLED KENNY, YOU BASTARD!	['bastard']
Stan	13	0	And finally, I couldn't hold it in anymore. I said Stop it!	[]
Stan	7	0	Stop it! It was me! My idea.	[]
Cartman	1	0	You?!	[]
Stan	30	0	Four days ago, I came across a brochure for ziplining.  I thought it would be fun. I only acted like it was an idea we all came up with together.	[]
Kyle	12	0	So you intended for us to go ziplining all along? Why, Stan?!	[]
Stan	12	0	If you signed up three friends, you got a free iPod Nano.	[]
Kyle	8	0	You sold us out?! For an iPod Nano?!	[]
Stan	9	0	I had no idea ziplining would be so boring.	[]
Cartman	4	0	You... You killed Kenny!	[]
Kyle	5	2	You BAStard! You BAStard, Stan!	['bastard', 'bastard']
Kyle	10	0	How many iPod Nanos is friendship worth? I guess, one.	[]
Stan	29	0	The hardest part about it is knowing you can't take it back.  I mean, it was the fifth-generation Nano, so I can't trade it in anywhere.	[]
Other	9	0	But then, miraculously, the boys' prayers are finally answered.	[]
Cartman	14	0	It was a miracle. He came to save us and take us back home.	[]
Cartman	4	0	You came for us!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Mr. Hankey!	[]
Stan	4	0	Thank you.  Mr. Hankey.	[]
Other	9	1	Howdy ho, boys? Let's get you back home.	['ho']
Cartman	6	0	We were saved. It was over.	[]
Other	103	1	After nearly four hours in the Colorado wilderness, the boys are finally going home. From the boat, the boys were airlifted aboard Mr. Hankey's magical helicrapter.  In the four hours since they had left home, the boys had traveled so far that Mr. Hankey then had to fly them on his Seven Turdy Seven.  From there, it was only an hour ride back home on the Poochoo Express.  Four friends, turn apart by tragedy , would now start the long journey back to forgiveness. Kenny McCormick's remains were finally brought home to his parents.  And the boys received treatment for their herpes.	['helicrapter']
Cartman	12	0	No, I didn't get herpes, I just had a cold sore.	[]
Other	82	0	Kyle Broflovski spent twenty seven days in the hospital having fecal matter removed from his nasal passages. Stan Marsh dedicated himself to raising awareness about the boredom risks of ziplining.  His awareness videos became so popular that Stan once again ended up jacking it in San Diego. As for Eric Cartman,  he refused to let the tragedy stop him from doing what he loves most. In just two weeks, he was back to drinking Diet Double Dew, defiant to dew the math.	[]
Cartman	11	0	It's diet, dude. Diet soda doesn't give you diarrhea.	[]
