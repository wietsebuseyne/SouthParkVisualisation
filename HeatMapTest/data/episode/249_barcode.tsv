Cartman	3	0	Hey dude. Sup?	[]
Craig	6	0	What are you guys doing here?	[]
Cartman	10	0	What do you mean? We're just... going to school.	[]
Other	10	0	I thought you guys said you didn't need school.	[]
Token	14	1	Yeah, you said you had a startup company and that school was for douchebags.	['douchebags']
Kyle	14	0	Oh! Tha-oh, yeah, the the startup company thing didn't really work out.	[]
Craig	9	1	But you told us all to go fuck ourselves.	['fuck']
Cartman	11	0	Ogh! Noo, noo, you guys, guys, what what we said was-	[]
Craig	19	1	You told us your company was gonna make $10 million, and the rest of us could go fuck ourselves.	['fuck']
Kyle	6	0	We were- trying to be funny.	[]
Other	7	0	Yeah well, no one's laughing, Kyle.	[]
Stan	2	0	Hey Wendy.	[]
Wendy	3	0	You're... back?	[]
Stan	9	0	Yeah, the startup company thing didn't work out.	[]
Wendy	5	0	Oh wow, I'm shocked.	[]
Stan	17	0	So hey, I was gonna see if you still wanted to see that stupid Maze Runner movie.	[]
Wendy	17	0	You broke up with me, Stan! You said you had to be free to chase your dreams.	[]
Stan	37	0	Wendy, I thought my life was going in a different direction and I just felt that I, I really had to give it everything I had, you know. I had I had to focus on one thing.	[]
Wendy	21	1	Is that why you told Clyde that you broke up with me? Because you're about to be  dripping in bitches?!	['bitches']
Stan	9	0	Huh? Why does everyone suddenly remember everything everybody says?	[]
Wendy	35	0	I'm happy, Stan. I'm happy I know who you really are now. You're someone who can't be counted on! You're someone who can just bail on the people you love!	[]
Cartman	7	0	Dude, people are pissed off at us.	[]
Kenny	5	1	(Yeah, it's fucking crazy!)	['fucking']
Kyle	11	0	Doesn't anyone understand the significance of I'm sorry anymore?	[]
Cartman	12	0	Yeah! Well said, Kyle! Good point! What, what happened to the significance?	[]
Kyle	22	0	Well, I guess let's just be thankful we're not Butters. They won't even let him come back to school.	[]
Other	39	0	All right everyone, thanks for coming. As you know, we urgently need to discuss the matter of Butters Stotch, who set fire to the school gymnasium and is now asking to come back. Are we all set to start?	[]
Other	9	0	Almost. We're just waiting on Mr. Mackey. Again.	[]
Other	6	0	Awww, do we need Mackey here?	[]
Mr. Garrison	19	1	Yeah, all he's gonna talk about is how he's gluten-free now and feels sooo fuckin' amazing.	['fuckin']
Other	11	0	Well, you have to admit he does look a little better.	[]
Other	8	0	He doesn't look any different to me.	[]
Other	12	0	In the cheeks, you don't think he looks a little fuller?	[]
Mr. Garrison	7	0	It's just the new diet fad!	[]
Mr. Mackey	36	0	Sorry I'm late. I had to stop and get my own breakfast because I figured y'all would be having doughnuts, but I'm actually gluten-free, so I can't have doughnuts, m'kay?	[]
Other	13	0	Yes, Mr. Mackey, we're all aware that you're gluten-free now.	[]
Mr. Mackey	11	1	I'm just sayin' that I personally feel sooo fuckin' amazing	['fuckin']
Mr. Garrison	11	0	Can we discuss the gymnasium and get out of here, please?	[]
Other	26	0	Right, so the issue, as you all know, is that Butters set fire to the gymnasium last week and ran away laughing and flipping everyone off.	[]
Mr. Mackey	6	0	That's probably gluten, m'kay?	[]
Other	2	0	Oh, God!	[]
Mr. Mackey	9	0	Gluten causes sluggishness, irritability, and nearly all behavioral problems,	[]
Mr. Garrison	8	0	I seriously cannot take hearing about gluten anymore.	[]
Mr. Mackey	20	0	See, that's probably the gluten talkin', uhkay? If you cut out gluten, you don't ever get pissed off.	[]
Other	16	0	Really? Mwell I might just give this gluten-free thing a try. How does it work?	[]
Mr. Garrison	10	0	Oh, no, don't try- oh God, here we go.	[]
Kyle	24	0	I don't know what we're going to do? It's been like four hours and people still won't talk to us.	[]
Kenny	7	1	(Right. What the fuck is going on?)	['fuck']
Cartman	15	1	You know what we gotta do, guys?  We've gotta throw a big fuckin' party	['fuckin']
Kenny	2	0	(A party?!)	[]
Cartman	23	0	Yeah! How do you make everyone like you? You have a big party and invite everyone and then everyone thinks you're cool!	[]
Kyle	11	0	Dude, that would have to be like, the best party ever.	[]
Cartman	28	2	Well I'm down. Between the four of us we can throw the sweetest party ever, and these assholes won't even remember us being dicks to them.	['assholes', 'dicks']
Kyle	13	0	Hey, that might work. But it can't be a party for us.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Right, it's gotta be an awesome party for...	[]
Stan	15	0	For someone that we love who needs us and that we refuse to bail on!	[]
Cartman	1	0	What?	[]
Kyle	20	0	No no, he's right! We've gotta make it for someone in need so that people have to go.	[]
Cartman	30	0	We lure people in with a cause and then hit 'em over the head with the best party ever. We're gonna have pizza and cake and a sweet band!	[]
Kyle	16	1	A band! Holy shit, Stan! Didn't you say your dad knows somebody who knows Lorde?	['shit']
Stan	13	0	Yeah, he said some guy at work is Lorde's uncle or something.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Oh my God, we've got Lorde to play live.	[]
Kenny	4	0	(This will be awesome!)	[]
Cartman	8	0	So who do we throw the party for?	[]
Stan	20	0	What do you mean? We have a friend who needs us right now, and we can't let him down.	[]
Other	34	0	All right, that was Get This Party Started and joining me in the studio now are four local boys who are gearing up to throw the most epic party ever. Is that right, boys?	[]
Kyle	8	0	Yeah, it's going to be this weekend.	[]
Cartman	17	0	You know, we just wanted to give back to the community and show everyone a good time.	[]
Other	24	0	Now, this party is also for a good cause, because it's to honor a little boy with diabetes, Scott Malkinson. Is that correct?	[]
Cartman	13	0	You, you know diabetes affects us all, but it mostly affects Scott Malkinson.	[]
Stan	16	0	Yeah, and we just- you know, we, we just can't turn our back on him.	[]
Other	16	0	Must be pretty special having a big party in your honor, Scott. How does it feel?	[]
Other	6	0	I actually have plans this weekend.	[]
Cartman	14	0	I actually have plans this weekend. I'm Scott Malkinson. I've got diabetes.	[]
Other	16	0	All right, well, we've got lots of people callin' in. Caller, what's your question?	[]
Craig	6	0	Are you guys making this up?	[]
Kyle	21	0	Nope! We're gonna have all the pizza you can eat, twenty different cakes, and Lorde is going to play live!	[]
Craig	6	0	All the pizza we can eat?	[]
Cartman	3	0	Believe it, dude.	[]
Craig	6	0	All right, this better be good.	[]
Other	14	0	All right, it's sure to be a blast. Phone lines are going craaazy!	[]
Stan	1	0	Sweet!	[]
Other	6	0	Next caller, what's your question?	[]
Other	12	0	Yes, will there be gluten-free options for people at this party?	[]
Stan	2	0	Excuse me?	[]
Other	33	0	Well I've been gluten-free for about a day now, and I have to say I feel sooo amazing. I just want to make sure there's food for all of us.	[]
Other	7	0	Mark in Fairplay, you had a comment?	[]
Other	41	0	Yeah, I agree with the last caller. I was in a restaurant and ordered the gluten-free quinoa salad, and a guy right next to me was eating a sandwich. It's like Get your second-hand gluten away from me!	[]
Other	13	0	All right, all right, next caller, you got a question for the boys?	[]
Mr. Garrison	20	0	Yeah, I swear, if I hear another person talking about being gluten-free I'm gonna piss in their face.	[]
Cartman	5	1	What the hell is gluten?	['hell']
Other	65	1	Hello everyone, my name is John Garner and I'm a nutrition advisor from the USDA. I want to clarify the USDA's position on a healthy diet. There's been a lot of confusion about gluten lately. People saying that gluten is the cause of cancer, gluten should be avoided, gluten can make your dick fly off, but let's set the record straight.	['dick']
Randy	5	1	Make your dick fly off?	['dick']
Other	86	3	People believe that omitting gluten will make you healthier, but of course, that's a bunch of hooey. Hooey is the preservative found in processed foods, that we now believe is the main culprit of obesity. You might say Well there's fat in butter too, but that's just poppycock. Poppycock first came from India and is the key ingredient in red meat which we now realize is good for you along with hooey. The good hooey, not the bad hooey. So what is gluten?	['fat', 'poppycock', 'poppycock']
Mr. Garrison	3	0	Yes, thank you!	[]
Other	88	0	Simply put, gluten is the protein found in flour when you take all the starch away. . Flour is of course, just wheat, and when you add a liquid to flour, you get dough.  Dough that makes breads, doughnuts, pasta, and all the hooey-free foods that humans enjoy.  Now, if we wash the dough of all its starch, we can actually distil the wheat down, minus the water, minus the starch, and what we're left with is pure gluten. Not a bio-weapon, just harmless flour protein.	[]
Mr. Mackey	3	0	Then eat it!	[]
Other	2	0	Excuse me?	[]
Mr. Mackey	12	0	If it's not dangerous, then eat that pure concentrated gluten, okay?	[]
Other	4	0	Yeah. Alright.  Dup, dup.	[]
Mr. Mackey	9	1	Oh, you see that? His dick's flyin' off.	['dick']
Other	13	0	Oh my God! These people don't even know!  Hurry! You gotta go!	[]
Mr. Garrison	13	0	Oh Jesus! Hey! It isn't safe in there!  Get out of there!	[]
Other	6	0	Get out! You're not safe!	[]
Mr. Garrison	4	0	You gotta get out!	[]
Other	4	0	Hurry! You gotta go!	[]
Randy	6	0	What about the Powerbars? The Powerbars?	[]
Other	1	0	Yes!	[]
Randy	2	0	Hamburger Helper?	[]
Other	4	0	That's all gluten!	[]
Randy	9	0	There's hot dog buns in that cupboard, Sharon!	[]
Other	14	0	Hey, dad, I need to talk to you about this party we're having.	[]
Randy	6	0	Oh my God, the WHEAT THINS!	[]
Other	7	0	It's in the Triscuits too, Randy!	[]
Stan	7	0	Wait, wait, ah I might need those.	[]
Randy	9	1	This stuff will make your dick fly off, Stan!	['dick']
Other	5	0	Don't forget the freezer!	[]
Randy	14	0	Oh God!  Chicken nuggets - breaded! Frozen burritos - flour! Ice cream! What about ice cream?!	[]
Other	8	0	I don't know! Look at the ingredients!	[]
Randy	12	0	Heavy cream, sugar, chocolate syrup - no, ice cream's good for you!	[]
Other	7	0	All right, that's all of it!	[]
Randy	9	0	You sure? All r- all right, you got those?!	[]
Other	7	0	I can get both of these, yeah!	[]
Randy	4	0	All right, come on!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Hey Cartman.	[]
Cartman	17	0	KYLE! IT'S ALL GONE! THEY'VE TAKEN IT ALL! WHY ARE THEY DOING THIS?! KYLE! KYLE!	[]
Kyle	3	0	Dude, calm down.	[]
Cartman	25	0	THERE'S NO SNACKS LEFT, KYLE! THEY TOOK ALL THE SNACKS AND THE PIZZA AND THE CAKE AND WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A PARTY!	[]
Kyle	11	1	Who took all the pizza and the cake?  What the hell?	['hell']
Cartman	1	0	KYYYLE!	[]
Mr. Garrison	13	1	Yeah! Get it! Get it all! Yeah, that's it! Burn, you bastard!	['bastard']
Other	7	0	What are you doing to my farm?!?	[]
Randy	16	1	You son of a bitch! Did you not know or did you just not care?! Keeyah!	['bitch']
Other	23	0	There's panic all over the country and you're telling me you don't have any kind of containment on this thing?!	[]
Other	9	0	We're working as fast as we can, sir.	[]
Other	10	0	Are you sure it's gluten that started the reaction?	[]
Other	25	0	We gave these rats an injection of concentrated whole wheat bread just a short time ago. You can see it already having a negative effect.	[]
Other	20	0	We told people that whole wheat bread was healthy! Isn't wheat the ingredient in pasta that makes it healthy?	[]
Other	8	1	No. We believe now that that's poppycock.	['poppycock']
Other	44	0	All right, listen up! We have the obligation to make this thing right and to tell people what is and isn't safe to eat. We are the USDA! Without us, people would be eating dirt and... chairs. Whatever it takes, stop this crisis!	[]
Kyle	9	0	Cartman? Come on, dude. You have to get up.	[]
Cartman	15	0	What's the point? Everyone hates us at school and our party's gonna suck.	[]
Stan	7	0	We can't let our party suck.	[]
Cartman	19	0	What kind of epic party can you have without pizza and cake? Now all we've got is Lorde.	[]
Kyle	15	0	That's right, we've still got Lorde. You talked to your dad, right Stan?	[]
Stan	4	0	I'll be back.	[]
Cartman	29	0	You know what I'mm gonna miss most? Pancakes. I keep having dreams of Aunt Jemima. She's trying to tell me something. But then she just fades away.	[]
Kyle	12	0	Cartman, we can't do this alone. You have to get up.	[]
Cartman	22	0	There's nothing left, you guys! The world is upside down. Things aren't gonna get better, they're gonna get worse.	[]
Randy	1	0	Yes?	[]
Other	18	0	Hello, sir. We've had word of a possible gluten exposure in your home. May we come in?	[]
Randy	5	0	Gluten expohn... oh not here!	[]
Other	5	0	Can we come in please?	[]
Randy	2	0	Wuh sure!	[]
Other	4	0	What's going on?	[]
Randy	6	0	Well that's just a beer.	[]
Other	2	0	Oh Jesus.	[]
Other	5	0	BEER IS ALL WHEAT, DAD!!	[]
Randy	7	0	Shuut up,  beer is bad for you?!	[]
Other	14	0	We're gonna need you to come with us, sir. Don't touch me.	[]
Randy	10	1	Look, I'm OK! Yuh, you wanna see my dick?	['dick']
Other	19	0	We just need you to be in quarantine for a while until everyone figures out what's going on.	[]
Randy	24	0	No! Not Papa John's.  I don't wanna go to Papa John's!  YOU CAN'T MAKE ME GO TO PAPA JOOOHN'S!!	[]
Randy	8	0	How long do I have to stay here?!	[]
Other	9	0	Until the USDA gets control of the situation, sir.	[]
Randy	6	0	What am I supposed to eat?	[]
Other	12	0	It's okay, there's lots of toppings. Just eat the toppings.	[]
Other	7	0	How'd you get exposed?  Bagels? Gravy?	[]
Randy	8	0	Beer. I didn't know it had gluten.	[]
Mr. Garrison	15	0	There's always somethin'. For me it was the soy sauce.  Sneaky, sneaky soy sauce.	[]
Other	22	0	We're trying to get a handle on just how much gluten there is out there, but... It seems impossible to contain.	[]
Other	12	0	And we have no idea how to tell people to protect themselves?	[]
Other	83	0	We've been running simulations, but they're problematic because they don't relate to our current schematics. Here, look. This is what we've been recommending for the past three years.  Five basic food groups, not four. We were wrong about that. We now realize, of course, that the largest of these groups we've been recommending is basically poison . Sir, to combat the gluten, we're trying every possible combination of the four remaining food groups, but so far, no answers.	[]
Other	5	0	Sir, the feds are here.	[]
Other	2	1	Oh shit!	['shit']
Other	2	0	Tom Vilsack?	[]
Other	1	0	Yes?	[]
Other	3	0	Michael Taylor, FDA.	[]
Other	9	0	Yeah, thank you, but this is a USDA problem.	[]
Other	9	0	Anything involving meat and dairy is our problem too!	[]
Stan	2	0	Dad? Dad!	[]
Randy	13	0	Stan! ...Hey! ...How's my boy? Daddy's gonna be all right. Okay?	[]
Stan	16	0	Yeah. Dad, you know that guy at work you said is Lorde's uncle or something?	[]
Randy	18	0	I can't touch you or hug you, but... but I'm right with you. Do you understand?	[]
Stan	14	0	Yeah. You remember you said that Lorde, the singer, her uncle worked with you?	[]
Randy	7	0	How's your mom? Your, your sister?	[]
Other	14	0	This is a quarantined area, kid. You're you're gonna have to go.	[]
Stan	4	0	Nonono, not yet. DAD!	[]
Randy	6	1	That's my son, you bastard!	['bastard']
Other	5	0	I'm sorry, all right?	[]
Stan	14	0	Dad, who's the guy at work that knows Lorde? Let me go! DAD!	[]
Randy	1	0	Staaan!	[]
Stan	6	0	Let me talk to my dad!	[]
Randy	1	0	Staaaaaaan!	[]
Craig	8	0	You call this a party?! Your party sucks!	[]
Token	6	0	Come on guys, let's go!	[]
Other	11	0	No food at a party? And I thought I was handicapped!	[]
Other	7	0	Hello, Eric.  Come on over here, sugar.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Aunt Jemima.	[]
Other	13	0	There's people in trouble, Eric. They need to be shown the way.	[]
Cartman	8	0	I don't know the way, Aunt Jemima.	[]
Other	14	0	You need to get to the USDA, child. They're lookin' for a sign.	[]
Cartman	8	0	I don't even know what that means.	[]
Other	8	0	When you're stuck, look to the pyramids.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Are you going to eat those pancakes?	[]
Other	11	0	They've got it wrong, child!  The world is upside down.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Oooo, trippy...	[]
Other	8	0	Tell then they've got's it backwards!	[]
Cartman	5	0	They've got what backward?	[]
Cartman	9	1	Noooo...  Oh Ohhh, oh. Hoooh. Fuck I want pancakes.	['fuck']
Randy	8	0	You can't just keep us in here!	[]
Mr. Garrison	15	0	We're out.  We're all out of toppings! There's nothing left to eat.	[]
Other	9	0	They're just gonna let us starve to death?	[]
Randy	14	0	They don't care about us. face it! We're already dead to them.	[]
Other	9	0	Well then, I guess I might as well eat!	[]
Mr. Garrison	7	0	There's nothing left, I told you.	[]
Other	6	0	There's plenty of pizza dough.	[]
Randy	3	0	Are you crazy?	[]
Other	19	1	I'm crazy hungry!  Oh... Oh... Fuck it's so good.  I want more! ...it's been so long!	['fuck']
Randy	8	0	Oh my God, you...  but... you're okay.	[]
Other	21	0	You don't think it's a little ridiculous that wheat protein is toxic? This whole thing was a setup, man!	[]
Mr. Garrison	5	0	A setup? But by who?	[]
Randy	18	0	Oh my God, we... we have to get a hold of someone who and get the word out.	[]
Other	18	0	Maybe Papa John can help us. If we can get a hold of them, then maybe we can-	[]
Randy	2	0	Ng-oh.	[]
Stan	86	0	There's a health crisis going on, and it's spreading faster than anyone realizes. For a long time we ignored it. Thought it would only affect the poor. People who ate Eggo waffles and Pizza Pockets. But gluten can attack anyone. This is not a time to party. This is a time to get serious. We're calling on everyone to spend this weekend learning about gluten and how to protect yourself and your family. Because we don't know how much time we have.	[]
Other	17	0	Well all right, time for action indeed. Let's go to the phone lines. Go ahead, caller.	[]
Craig	11	0	I knew you guys were going to bail on the party.	[]
Kyle	18	0	We're not bailing on the party, we're just think there's... more important things right now!	[]
Craig	12	0	Uh huh, you guys couldn't get Lorde to play, could you?	[]
Other	11	0	All right, let's go to Jamie in Como. Go ahead.	[]
Other	34	1	It's like ya... ya say you're gonna throw the most epic party of the decade and then you rip it away! It's kind of like.... telling everyone to go fuck themselves!	['fuck']
Other	13	0	Oh Kansas, watch the language there. Next caller, you're on the air.	[]
Wendy	26	0	Why are you doing this party, Stan? Was it because you made people mad at school or... because you just wanted to be a big shot?	[]
Stan	13	0	I... we... we wanted to bring people together and help Scott Malkinson, but-	[]
Wendy	25	0	So then at a time when people really need to come together you cancel on 'em? I'm pretty sure Scott Malkinson still has diabetes.	[]
Other	6	0	That is correct, yes, I do.	[]
Wendy	16	0	You couldn't put on the party you were hoping to put on, was that it?	[]
Kyle	3	0	Jesus Christ, dude.	[]
Stan	8	0	Wendy, there IS a health crisis right now...	[]
Wendy	18	0	Right, and when things change or things come up, you don't forget about everything you promised people!	[]
Stan	16	0	We had no idea what to serve people to eat, okay?! We're gonna look stupid!	[]
Wendy	2	0	Thought so.	[]
Other	12	0	Ohhhhhh well all right, next caller is Eric. Are you there, Eric?	[]
Cartman	1	0	KYYYLE!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Cartman?	[]
Cartman	16	0	KYYYLE, WHAT DOES USDA STAND FOR?! AUNT JEMINA SAID USDA HAS TO LOOK AT THE PYRAMIDS!	[]
Other	18	0	It's dinner time on the East coast in less than an hour. People are going to die!	[]
Other	16	0	Sir! They've got a boy on the hot line who says he might know something.	[]
Other	3	0	Who is this?	[]
Cartman	15	0	My name isn't important. What matters is that... the answer is in the pyramid.	[]
Other	17	0	The pyramid? That's ancient stuff you're talking about. Are you sure?  Bring up the pyramid!	[]
Cartman	8	0	What, what is it? What is it for?	[]
Other	21	0	We built the pyramid a long time ago to illustrate how much people should eat of the four basic food groups.	[]
Other	10	0	Sir, we abandoned the pyramid when Michelle Obama got involved.	[]
Other	9	0	The pyramid down't work. We already tried it.	[]
Cartman	4	0	It's upside down.	[]
Other	1	0	What?	[]
Cartman	6	0	Sir, the pyramid is upside down.	[]
Other	5	0	Turn the pyramid upside down.	[]
Other	16	1	You can't be serious. That would put butter and fat at the top of the-	['fat']
Other	5	1	Flip the damned food pyramid!	['damned']
Other	5	0	This is NOT FDA-approved!	[]
Other	13	0	It's dinnertime on the east coast in ten minutes! Now DO IT!	[]
Other	6	0	Sir, we've got a match.	[]
Other	3	0	Nutrition is stabilizing!	[]
Other	8	0	We've got a well-balanced vaccine, sir!	[]
Other	15	0	Get the President on the phone. Tell him... to have some steak with his butter.	[]
Craig	11	0	Well, I gotta admit, you guys throw a pretty sweet party.	[]
Kyle	9	0	Hey, we'd do anything for our bros, man.	[]
Other	9	0	Would you guys care for a frozen butter pop?	[]
Kyle	7	0	We're good, Scott. Stop bugging us.	[]
Other	16	0	We really dodged a bullet, young man. Thanks to you, America knows what to eat again.	[]
Cartman	18	0	Yeah well, I'm glad people aren't mad at you anymore. I know what that feels like.	[]
Other	10	0	We're gonna get a better view of the stage.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Yeah yeah, enjoy the party.	[]
Other	13	0	Wait till my girls see that I was at a party with Lorde!	[]
Clyde	9	0	I'm glad the food is good. Lorde sucks.	[]
Other	8	0	Yeah, she isn't as hot in person.	[]
Randy	23	0	Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. I am Lorde, yeah yeah yeah. Lorde, Lorde. Call me Lorde yeah yeah yeah. Yeah yeah yeah.	[]
Stan	5	0	Hey Wendy, you havin' fun?	[]
Wendy	8	0	Yeah, sure. You guys really pulled it off.	[]
Stan	21	0	Yeah, well, I just couldn't sit around while my dad was locked away. I love him and he needed me.	[]
Wendy	5	0	You're so transparent, Stan.	[]
Stan	4	0	What does that mean?	[]
Wendy	3	0	You wanna dance?	[]
Randy	21	0	We love the city, yeah yeah yeah, 'cause I am Lorde. I am Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde Lorde yeah yeah yeah.	[]
