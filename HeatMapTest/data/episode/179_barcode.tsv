Butters	2	0	We lost?	[]
Other	29	0	It is natural. It's natural tonight to feel some disappointment. We fought as hard as we could, and though we fell short, the failure is mine, not yours.	[]

Other	16	0	Yeah, so I've heard. You guys are out of your freakin' minds, you know that?	[]
Other	15	0	Yes, we do. Assemble the rest of the team: we've only got ten hours.	[]

Cartman	7	0	Hey, you guys wanna buy a TV?	[]
Other	21	0	Bravo Obama and McCain. Ten years you two have been working on this plan and you've finally pulled it off!	[]
Other	24	0	Guys, we've all known each other a long time, had many incredible adventures, but this is going to be our greatest feat ever.	[]
Other	17	0	I knew it! I knew when you two ran for President you were just working an angle.	[]
Other	4	0	Always workin' the angles.	[]
Other	24	0	My friends, while the entire country is busy reacting to the election, we are about to pull off the greatest heist in human history.	[]
Other	11	0	So, come on, enlighten us. What are we stealing this time?	[]
Other	28	0	The Hope Diamond, rated #4 of the ten most precious diamonds in the world. Going street value, Middle-Eastern market, of course, two hundred and ten million dollars.	[]
Other	3	0	Two hundred ten?	[]
Other	1	0	Million.	[]
Other	15	0	No no no, the Hope Diamond is ungettable. Every thief in the world knows that.	[]
Other	57	0	Almost ungettable. The diamond is kept in the Smithsonian Natural History Museum, long considered to be the most thief-proof structure ever built.  The Diamond Wing Is protected by impenetrable walls of two-foot wide steel. On the northeast side, a seven-five laser system.  There's simply no side of the Smithsonian that can be breached.	[]
Other	13	0	So you go in from the roof, drop into it from the top.	[]
Other	16	0	Can't get it to from the top because a polymer shelf runs the entire expanse.	[]
Other	26	0	Okay, you can't get into the museum from any side and you can't drop in from above, so you can't get the diamond.	[]
Other	50	0	Meet... the Presidential Escape Tunnel,  A two-mile long underground passage that runs from the White House to a location outside the city limits in case of an attack. The tunnel is only accessible from the Oval Office and just happens to travel right underneath the Smithsonian Natural History Museum.	[]
Other	2	0	Boom, baby!	[]
Other	20	0	You get somebody into that tunnel, they can blast into the museum, let the others in, the heist is on.	[]
Other	22	0	So you both run for President because one of you has to win, and you've got your access to the tunnel.	[]
Other	22	0	And we run on a particularly brutal campaign so that the nation is as distracted as possible over the next... eight hours.	[]
Other	5	0	This all sounds very risky.	[]
Other	20	0	We've spent ten years putting this plan together. If we are indeed the greatest thief club in the world-	[]
Other	3	0	And we are.	[]
Other	5	0	-we won't get caught.	[]
Kyle	20	0	Yes, ah I'm trying to locate my parents. M-my name is Kyle Broflovski. Yes, I know Obama won.	[]
Stan	7	0	Kyle, Kyle you gotta get out here.	[]
Kyle	1	0	What?!	[]
Stan	16	0	Your little brother has climbed out of the window. I I think he's gonna jump!	[]
Kyle	3	0	Oh my God!	[]
Kyle	70	0	Ike, don't do it! There's still so much to live for!  I know you really wanted McCain to win but, but it's going to be okay.  No, that's not true, Ike. The economy could easily stabilize with Obama's plan.  Ike, don't jump! You could really hurt your ankle or something.  Really Ike, that's like five feet off the ground. Don't do it.	[]
Ike	2	0	Good-bye.	[]
Other	1	0	NOO!	[]
Kyle	4	1	Ike?  Oh crap Ike?	['crap']

Other	10	0	They're all, they're all right through here, sir.	[]
Other	12	0	Uh, hello, is there something we can do for you, Mr. Obama?	[]
Other	10	0	Just checking out the new digs. How are you guys?	[]
Other	2	0	Good, sir.	[]
Other	9	0	I'd like to see the Oval Office, please?	[]
Other	2	0	Right now?	[]
Other	32	0	I don't waste time, gentlemen. I've only got two months to figure out how I wanna redecorate, if you know what I mean. You know, change the drapes and stuff.	[]
Other	6	0	Sure, right this way, Mr... President.	[]
Other	8	0	I will need absolute privacy, is that understood?	[]
Other	2	0	Yes sir.	[]
Other	1	0	Thanks.	[]
Other	5	0	I got a hundred dollars.	[]
Other	6	0	All right, McCain. I'm in.	[]
Other	15	0	Nicely done, B. We're in position outside the Smithsonian.  You find the escape tunnel?	[]
Other	7	0	I'm already on it.  Boom baby.	[]

Stan	5	0	Dad, what are you doing?!	[]
Randy	31	4	It's okay, Stan, everything's changed. I don't need this stupid fuckin' job anymore! You lil fucking assfuck, piece of shit  You know what Obama said? Yes we can!	['fuckin', 'fucking', 'assfuck', 'shit']
Other	5	0	Hey, I voted for Obama.	[]
Randy	6	0	Obama's not talkin' about you!	[]
Kyle	12	0	Can someone help us? My little brother fell out of a window.	[]
Other	33	0	I just wanna say to everyone who's a little disappointed that we lost the election that there's always next year. Maybe I'll run again for Vice President again in 2009.	[]
Other	11	0	Uh Mrs. Palin, have you seen or heard from John McCain?	[]
Other	29	0	Uh, uh, nnno, I don't really know where he went. Kinda seems a little odd, I guess, but  Oh, my phone's going ringy. Ex-cuse me.  Hello?	[]
Other	5	0	Hello Sarah, it's McCain.	[]
Other	21	0	I hope to God you're calling to tell me you're in position below the vault with the L7 charges.	[]
Other	14	0	I'm in the tunnel now, Sarah. I should be almost below the museum.	[]
Other	46	0	Just make sure you don't blow the transformers along with the tunnel because it will trigger the five-four laser system! And don't damage any coupling wires or it'll be worthless when Gary shuts down the grid. I'll be there in thirty.	[]
Other	4	0	God she's awesome.	[]
Other	26	0	Oh, I guess Senator McCain's gonna fly me back to Alaska now. He's got a private jet, you know? Okay, byebye then.  Bloody idiots.	[]
Other	5	0	All right, here we go.	[]
Other	4	0	What's that noise?	[]
Other	7	0	It's okay, just some construction outside.	[]
Other	8	0	Oh no.  McCain? We've got a problem.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Hang in there, Ike. We're gonna get you help.	[]
Stan	5	0	Hey, there's some people.	[]
Other	17	0	Let's just stay back- STAY BACK! We don't have any more room in the Ark.	[]
Other	12	0	You have to let us in! You know the country's doomed!	[]
Other	7	0	Who are you to turn us away?!	[]
Other	15	0	I built this bunker in case McCain lost! There isn't enough room for everyone!	[]
Kyle	8	0	Hey, excuse me, but we need some help.	[]
Other	13	0	I know you do, but there's no more room, I tell ya!	[]
Other	7	0	You're going to deny them too?	[]
Other	27	0	For God's sake, man, they're children!  Look them in the eyes and tell them you won't take them in!  Look at their little cheeks!	[]
Stan	6	1	Let go of my face, asshole!	['asshole']

Other	5	0	Is there a problem, gentlemen?	[]
Other	8	0	Uh, no. No, sir. Everything okay in there?	[]
Other	15	0	Why wouldn't it be? I'm sorry, but I asked to be left alone?	[]
Other	10	0	Yes, sir, it's, just that... your wife is here.	[]
Other	2	0	My wife?	[]
Other	13	0	Barack, everyone's been looking for you. What on earth are you doing?	[]
Other	11	0	Uh, c-c-come on in, darling.  Thank, thank you boys.	[]
Other	8	0	Okay Barack, tell me what's going on?	[]
Other	9	0	Michelle, there's something I need to tell you.	[]
Other	7	0	What is it?  Barack, what is it?!	[]
Other	15	0	The laser system guarding the diamond was replaced by an optical relay three days ago.	[]
Other	15	0	You gotta be kiddin' me. So the entire diamond vault is inaccessible?! Is McCain online?	[]
Other	2	0	Hi, Michelle.	[]
Other	11	0	You guys weren't runnin' update checks on the security logs?!	[]
Other	14	0	Michelle, we need you to do a different scan hack through the vault relay.	[]
Other	31	1	On a new system, in an hour?! Are you nuts? My job was to pretend to be married to this bozo and get you three scan hacks into a laser system!	['nuts']
Other	33	0	Michelle, it's Sarah. They did replace the laser system, but the new one isn't brand-new. It's an old H-7 series. You can break this baby in 30 minutes.	[]
Other	17	0	Egh. Tell Davis to get me a fortrans emitter and enough pulse drives to light a spark.	[]
Other	5	0	Did you catch that, Davis?	[]
Other	4	0	I'm on it.	[]
Kyle	10	0	We made it, Ike. You're going to be okay.	[]
Other	7	0	There, just take a seat over there.	[]
Kyle	9	0	E-excuse me, my little brother needs medical attention.	[]
Other	9	0	Was he an Obama supporter or a McCain supporter?	[]
Stan	4	0	Why does that matter?	[]
Other	17	0	Because then I'll know if he partied too hard or if he tried to kill himself.	[]
Kyle	11	0	Ma'am, please, I think my little brother needs immediate help.	[]
Other	22	0	You don't understand, kid: there's only two doctors on call, and Dr. Wilson is out celebrating in the streets somewhere.	[]
Stan	6	0	So where's the other doctor?	[]
Randy	45	0	Hey, come on people. We can keep partying, can't we? Yes we can! Come on, let's sing. O-bama. Well you came and you gave without taking.  And I sent you away, O-bama. When you kissed me and stopped me from shakin'.	[]
Other	16	0	I've almost got it. You're only going to have five minutes. Do you understand?	[]
Other	9	0	Did you really not like pretending to be married?	[]
Other	8	0	Oh Jesus, now is not the time, B.	[]
Other	10	0	Come on. You have to admit we had some fun.	[]
Other	16	0	My girls need somebody better than a world-class diamond thief. Woowait, there! I got it.	[]

Other	10	1	I said I put a bomb in your building, bitch.	['bitch']
Other	31	0	5:13, the guards open the southwest door, checking the museum for any bombs.  5:14, McCain, dressed as a football player, enters security and shuts off the diamond case alarm.	[]
Other	3	0	Hey you! Stop!	[]
Other	32	0	Michelle and I head back into the tunnel and the hole is patched.  5:15 a.m., I walk out of the Oval Office with the diamond securely hidden in my anus.	[]
Other	3	0	All done. Thanks.	[]
Other	2	0	Boom, baby!	[]
Other	22	0	There's just one thing: don't you think people are going to be suspicious when you disappear? Go looking for you?	[]
Other	11	0	We hired a guy for that a couple of months ago.	[]
Kyle	4	1	What the hell?  Ike?	['hell']
Ike	2	0	Boom, baby.	[]
Other	10	0	Here are all the tickets for your group, Mr. Sanchez.	[]
Other	4	0	Thank you very much.	[]
Other	5	0	Well friends, let us depart.	[]
Other	12	0	Hey uh, you guys go ahead. I just came to say goodbye.	[]
Other	1	0	Wha?	[]
Other	13	0	I decided to hang it up, maybe give this President thing a shot.	[]
Other	6	0	B, you can't be serious.	[]
Other	11	0	Besides, you died in a jet in the Rocky Mountains, remember?	[]
Other	41	0	Could have been I didn't make that flight.  What do you say, Michelle? Would you and your girls like to move into the White House with me? You know, settle down, just be President and First Lady for a while.	[]
Other	3	0	You're serious.	[]
Other	13	0	Who knows? Maybe we could change a few things. What do you say?	[]
Other	4	1	Aww, what the fuck.	['fuck']
Other	5	0	I just looove happy endings.	[]
Other	10	0	It's still here, ih... it's all still here.	[]
Mr. Garrison	6	0	Does that mean... maybe we overreacted?	[]
Other	19	0	No, no, I wouldn't say that. It's just maybe... well, uh... maybe Obama will be all right.	[]
Randy	21	0	Uhh...  Oh ow.  Hey, where are my pants?  Where's our TV?! Where are my pants and where's my TV?!	[]
Stan	9	0	Dad, your boss called. He said you're fired.	[]
Randy	24	2	Oh!  Ugh, God damn it! Obama said things would be different! That sonofabitch lied to us! I knew I should have voted for McCain!	['damn', 'sonofabitch']
