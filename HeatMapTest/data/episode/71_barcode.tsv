Mr. Garrison	23	0	Eric, that is a lot of money. Don't you think you should keep it in the bank instead of at your house?	[]
Cartman	11	0	I'm not keeping it, Mr. Garrison, I'm spending it.	[]

Cartman	16	0	On my dream.  On the one thing that I've wanted ever since I could remember...	[]

Cartman	11	0	Would you mind stepping aside? I have a purchase to make.	[]
Stan	11	0	Dude, can you loan me twenty bucks for a new jacket?	[]
Cartman	20	0	HA! If you need money, you can get a JOB, Stan! No freeloaders are gonna take my hard-earned cash!	[]
Kyle	11	0	Your grandma left it to you! You didn't earn it!	[]
Cartman	46	1	Didn't earn it?! What about all the years I spent making Grandma like me?! All the wet spit-filled kisses I put up with?! The constant smell of aspirin and pee?! Don't tell me I didn't earn it, you son of a bitch!	['bitch']
Kyle	6	0	No... No, this isn't possible.	[]
Stan	4	0	Yeah, it's unbelievable.	[]
Kyle	25	1	No, I mean, this is impossible, Stan! Cartman is the biggest asshole in the world! How is it that God gives him a million dollars?	['asshole']
Stan	12	0	Come on, we gotta see what Cartman is doing with his money.	[]
Kyle	20	0	Why? How could you do this? There are people starving in Alabama and... and you give Cartman a million dollars?	[]
Other	12	0	...Aaand if we can just get you to sign here...  and here... .	[]
Other	9	0	Are you sure this is what you want, sweetie?	[]
Cartman	8	0	My own amusement park, Mother. I'm sure.	[]

Other	5	0	I can't do it.	[]
Other	1	0	What?	[]
Cartman	1	0	What?!	[]
Other	27	0	Uh uh I can't sell this poor kid my park.  Look, I haven't been honest with you. The park hasn't been doing great business.	[]
Other	1	0	Frank...	[]
Other	30	0	Sshhhh. It ain't right, Chris.  The truth is, the park is a financial flop. I haven't turned a profit in years because I can't keep attendance up.	[]
Cartman	13	0	Oh, but I'm not buying the park to get people to come.	[]
Other	4	0	You... you're not?	[]
Cartman	141	0	No no! I'm buying it to keep people out!  Don't you see? Forever it has been my dream to have my very own theme park, so that I could be alone in it, all day, every day. I love theme parks.  But the lines! Everywhere you go, people, crowds,  The rides are great, but...  All the lines, lines, LINES!  If there's one thing I hate,  all the lines, lines, lines, LINES!!  And then there get to be so many people  that they make FastPass.  So then there's lines for FastPass.  You stand in line to get a ticket to stand in line later. Then there's lines for the bathrooms , lines for the drinks , lines for cantakuras  and rare Kartankulas Plinks!  ...And, so you see, this park is for me. Nobody else will be allowed in it.	[]
Other	11	0	Nn-oh. Well then, I guess I don't feel bad.	[]
Other	8	0	Mr. Cartman, congratulations, the theme park is yours.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Gentlemen, I thank you.	[]
Stan	13	0	Kyle?  Dude, what are you doing here? Everybody's looking for you. Kyle?	[]
Kyle	109	3	Do you know what happened to me this morning, Stan? This morning... I woke up and felt a sharp pain in my ass. I felt down there and, and found this... big sore lump. On my ass, Stan. I couldn't even sit down, so... I, I had to tell my mother, which, which was humiliating. She took me to the doctor, which was more humiliating, a- a- nd he told me. I-I have a hemorrhoid. It's like an infected blood vessel on your ass. I'm nine years old, and I have a hemorrhoid, Stan. I have a hemorrhoid, and, Cartman has his own theme park.	['ass', 'ass', 'ass']
Stan	8	0	Kyle, I, I understand what you mean, but--	[]
Kyle	77	0	Do you?! Do you, Stan?! Because all my life I was raised to believe in Jehovah! To believe that we should all behave a certain way and good things will come to us. I make mistakes, but every week I try to better myself. I'm always saying, You know, I learned something today... and what does this so-called God give me in return? A hemorrhoid. He doesn't make sense!  What is your logic?!  Ow.	[]
Stan	53	0	Look. Cartman... he thinks he's gonna be happy because he has his own amusement park, but, he's gonna find out that without other people, the rides are totally lame. I mean, who could really have fun by themselves at a theme park? I'll bet he's sick of it already.	[]
Cartman	69	2	Yyeessss! Yyeessss!  Awesome!  Ho ho!  Sweet!  Yes!  Folks, please keep your arms and legs inside the vehicle at all times, make sure your seat belts are fastened, and enjoy the Mine Shaft!  Yes!  Yes!  Oh, cool!  Oh, look how much fun I had!  Whoa!

Stan	10	0	Oh, hey dude. Terrance & Phillip is just about to start.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Great.	[]
Stan	3	0	What's that?	[]
Kyle	16	0	It's my seat ring. I have to sit on it because of my hemorrhoid.  Ow.	[]
Stan	3	0	Heh, heh.  Sorry.	[]
Kyle	10	0	So, how are things going at Cartman's theme park?!	[]
Stan	16	0	Dude, just forget about it. We can't let him get to us, or he wins.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Hunh, I guess you're right.	[]
Cartman	124	0	Hey, everybody! Check out the all new Cartmanland! It's our Graaand Opening! Cartmanland has over a hundred fabulous rides , six roller coasters , and tons of great surprises!  And the best part is:  You can't come!!  That's right, because at Cartmanland, only I, Eric Cartman, can get in! That means only I can ride the all-new Tornado Twister , a roller coaster that splashes in the water! Wow!  It's the greatest amusement park in the Colorado area! And nobody can go!! Especially Stan and Kyle!! HAHA!!  So come on down to Cartmanland now!  But don't plan on getting past the parking lot,  'cause remember:  So much to do at Cartmanland, but you can't come!  Especially you, Stan and Kyle.	[]
Stan	4	0	That does it, dude!	[]
Kyle	4	0	Where are we going?	[]
Stan	14	0	We're getting into that fatass's park whether he likes it or not!	[]
Cartman	33	0	Whoa! Heheh.  Whoa!  Whoa! Heheheheheh.  Aw, man, that was awesohome! That one part, with the-uum, with the spider that dropped on ya? Oho, man, that totally got me. That was sweet! Heheh.	[]
Kyle	11	0	Ah! Ow! Hey, it hurts!  Owie-ow! Help! Ow, that hurts!	[]
Cartman	3	1	What the hell?	['hell']
Kyle	2	0	Hohohooho! Oowwww!	[]
Cartman	4	1	You sons of bitches!	['bitches']
Stan	3	0	Come on, dude!	[]
Kyle	8	0	Hoh Gohod, I popped it!! Oh hit huhurts!!	[]
Cartman	6	1	What the hell are you doing?!	['hell']
Stan	2	1	Aw, crap.	['crap']
Kyle	7	0	Oh God, get me off of here!!	[]
Stan	1	0	Dude!	[]
Kyle	14	0	Stan, I have to go home!! I need my cream!! I need my creeheam!!	[]
Stan	4	0	Alright, let's go.	[]
Cartman	6	0	That's right! You stay out!	[]
Stan	23	3	You can't keep us out forever, you fucking fat ass! We'll be back as soon as Kyle's hemorrhoid is better!	['fucking', 'fat', 'ass']
Kyle	7	0	My life can't get any worse!	[]
Stan	7	0	You'll see! We'll get in!	[]
Cartman	36	0	...Alright, so listen: All I want you to do is keep anybody out who tries to get in here. If you see anybody on my propertih, especially Stan and Kyle, you are to shoot on sight!	[]
Other	7	0	So what does does this job pay?	[]
Cartman	40	0	Alright, now this is very hard for me to do, you understand. But, in return for you working security, I'll let you ride two rides a day. But only two rides, and only if I'm not on them.	[]
Other	10	0	Uh, I'm afraid I don't really like rides.	[]
Cartman	16	0	But, you can ride anything you want. And you don't have to wait in line.	[]
Other	4	0	I'm not interested.	[]
Cartman	13	0	Dude, are you from Mars or something? Any ride you want. No lines.	[]
Other	9	0	If you need security, I need a cash salary.	[]
Cartman	13	0	But I don't have any cash. I spent everything on this park.	[]
Other	40	0	Well, look: Why don't you just let a couple of people in each day? Every day you can just let two people in, charge $29.95 per ticket, and then you can use that to pay my daily salary.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Ugh... Two people?	[]
Other	19	0	This place is huge. You'll never notice two people. And then you'll have security for your park.	[]
Cartman	23	1	Well, all alright, Goddamnit! I'll open the park to two people each day! But remember: anybody else you see trespassing the park...	['goddamnit']
Other	5	0	I will shoot on sight.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Sweet.	[]
Other	20	0	You're a very lucky little boy. I've never seen a hemorrhoid so infected. It could have killed you.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Lucky.	[]
Other	12	0	Oh, look, Kyle. Your little friend Stan is here to see you.	[]
Stan	4	0	Dude, are you okay?	[]
Kyle	47	0	Oh, I'm swell, Stan. I popped my hemorrhoid trying to climb the fence into Cartmanland, and it got infected. I really need to go to the bathroom, but if I do, it will pop again and the pain will make me pass out. How are you?	[]
Stan	30	0	Well um, ah-I found out that Cartman is letting a few people each day into his theme park. I was thinking we could put on disguises and get in.	[]
Other	23	0	Ah-ah-ah-I'm afraid Kyle can't ride any amusement park rides for over a year because of his horrible hemorrhoid.	[]
Stan	1	0	Jesus.	[]
Kyle	37	0	But it's okay, Stan, because I finally figured it out. You see, if someone like Cartman can get a million dollars and his own theme park, then there is no God. There's no God, dude.	[]
Other	6	0	Kyle, don't say such things!	[]
Kyle	29	0	Why? Why, Mom? Because if I do something bad will happen to me? Because if I do your God might not shower me with his blessings of infected hemorrhoids?	[]
Other	10	0	Kyle, y-you-you just don't understand. It's--	[]
Kyle	21	0	No! I finally do understand! There is no justice! There is no God! Do you hear me?! I renounce my faith!!	[]
Cartman	15	0	Alright, alright, listen up, people. Cartmanland is open, but only to two people each day.	[]
Other	1	0	Aw.	[]
Other	3	1	That's gay.	['gay']
Cartman	13	0	I just gotta cover my security expenses. Butters, Clyde, you can come in.	[]
Butters	1	0	Hoh.	[]
Clyde	1	0	Oh.	[]
Cartman	11	0	The rest of you will just have to try another day.	[]
Other	1	0	Aw.	[]
Cartman	23	0	'K, one park admission? That will be twenty-nine ninety five, sir.  Five cents is your change and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland.	[]
Butters	4	0	Hoh boy, oh boy!	[]
Cartman	60	0	...and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland.  Ogh, finally, work is over. Now I can get back to riding my rides.  Dada da, I've got my own theme park. Hm, what should I go on now? I know! I'll go on the Haunted Mansion ride again!  Da dait daa da Da dat dadadadadadaa da-ah-  What are you doing?	[]
Butters	10	0	We're waitin' in line for the-ah spook house.	[]
Cartman	14	0	Line? Lines! I HATE LINES!!! Can't you go on something else right now?	[]
Butters	25	0	Well we wanna see the spook house. Uh well, we paid twenty-nine ninety five; we should be able to go in the spook house.	[]
Clyde	13	0	Yeah! But I think it's broke down. The cars aren't moving.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Ugh, alright, alright, hang on.  Security!	[]
Other	1	0	What?	[]
Cartman	16	0	Oh, Jesus! Uh, look, the haunted house ride broke down. I need you to fix it.	[]
Other	6	0	Uh, I'm security, not maintenance.	[]
Cartman	8	0	But I don't know how it works.	[]
Other	18	0	Well your rides are gonna break down every now and then. You need to hire a maintenance person.	[]
Cartman	19	0	Ogh, alright, alright! I'll let two more people in each day so I can hire a maintenance person.	[]
Cartman	95	0	Alright folks, we've had another change in policy. I've had to hire a maintenance person, and to pay his salary I have to let in two more people a day.  However, the stupid maintenance worker demanded I have food and drinks inside the park, so now I've had to hire a beverage person, and a cotton-candy person, which means I now have to let eight people come in a day! BUT, you are to try your best not to ride any rides that I am on! Understood?  Alright, let's go.	[]
Other	1	0	Timmay!	[]
Cartman	6	0	Wait a minute! Who are you?	[]
Other	2	0	Mike Gainor.	[]
Cartman	8	1	HA! Get the hell out of here, Stan!	['hell']
Stan	5	1	Goddamnit Cartman, let me in!	['goddamnit']
Cartman	11	0	I thought you said buying a theme park was stupid! SECURITY!	[]
Stan	15	2	It is stupid, Cartman! You made Kyle lose his faith in God, you fat asshole!	['fat', 'asshole']
Cartman	5	0	Get him out of here!	[]
Other	3	0	Move along, sir.	[]
Stan	6	0	AGGH!  This isn't over, Cartman!	[]
Cartman	22	0	Eugh. Well, now I can finally get back to my riding my rides!  Uh oh! Oh man, I'm so scared!  AAAGGGHHH....	[]
Kyle	2	0	Agh!  Agghh!	[]
Other	7	0	Just a little more.  There we go.	[]
Other	7	0	Hello, Kyle. How's the hemorrhoid today?	[]
Kyle	1	0	Awesome.	[]
Other	17	0	Kyle, we wanna tell you about the Book of Job. It's a story from the Bible.	[]
Kyle	12	0	I've had enough of the Bible. What has it gotten me?	[]
Other	47	0	Oh, I think you'll see differently after hearing this. Sit down, Kyle.  Uh, okay.  You see, Job lived in the east of Jordan, a long long time ago.  Job was a great man. He was blessed with ten lovely children , a wonderful wife, and many friends.	[]
Other	11	0	He was godly, and a good man, and fed the poor.	[]
Other	15	0	He was the most upright and honorable of men, and every day he praised God.	[]
Other	12	0	But one day, Satan went up to Heaven and talked to God.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Satan talked to God?	[]
Other	30	0	Yes, in the Book of Job, Satan talks to God. And God says to Satan, Have you seen Job? He is a great man, and he praises me every day.	[]
Other	28	0	But Satan said, Oh yeah? He only praises you because you gave him so much. If you didn't give him those things, he would curse your name.	[]
Other	26	0	To which God said, Oh yeah? I'll show you, Satan! I'll take those things away from Job and he will still praise my name.	[]
Other	22	0	And so, God had a bunch of barbarians come in and slaughter Job's oxen and donkeys, and murder all his workers.	[]
Other	18	1	Then God sent his fireballs from the sky and killed his sheep and the rest of his employees.	['fireballs']
Other	25	0	And then, as Job's sons and daughters were eating, God sent a mighty wind to collapse the house and crush and kill them all.	[]
Other	25	0	Job was terribly sad, but he fell to his knees and said, The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away, and praised God's name.	[]
Other	10	0	So then, Job got painful sores all over his body.	[]
Other	16	0	He was in terrible, miserable pain all day, every day. But he still kept his faith.	[]
Other	12	0	God said to Satan, See? I told you. Job still praises me.	[]
Kyle	8	0	And that's it? That's the end?	[]
Other	1	0	Basically.	[]
Kyle	29	0	That's the most horrible story I've ever heard. Why would God do such a horrible thing to a good person just to prove a point to Satan?	[]
Other	6	0	Oh. Uhhh, I don't know.	[]
Kyle	23	0	Then I was right. Job has all his children killed, and Michael Bay gets to keep making movies. There isn't a God.	[]
Cartman	76	1	...And, since the stupid security guard needs video surveillance, I have to let in two more people a day to cover those expenses... Need to cover the new ticket guy's salary, so that's three more admissions a day...  Cleanup crew for the bathroom, money to cover paint and upkeep - so that's about four admissions - that brings the grand total to...  God-damnit!  Eight hundred and sixteen people can come into the park today!	['damnit']
Other	3	0	Welcome to Cartmanland.	[]
Other	7	0	Isn't he getting any better, doctor?	[]
Other	37	0	I don't understand it. He's not fighting the infected hemorrhoid at all. It's like he... like he's lost all hope. Well if you'll excuse me, I've got more tests to run.	[]
Other	8	0	And now back to Money Quest, on HBC.	[]
Other	41	0	Welcome back to Money Quest.  In just over two weeks, young financial genius Eric Cartman  has managed to turn a theme park that was seeing less than a hundred attendees a day into a thriving park with attendance in the thousands.	[]
Other	59	0	And the way he did it is with the brilliant You Can't Come technique. For the first several days, the young businessman saturated the market with the claim that nobody could get into his park. It made the public crazy. So then, weeks later, when he opened the doors, they were lining up around the block. Simply amazing.	[]
Other	21	0	Well, ahah I think we should point out that this technique is already being applied by businesses all over the country.	[]
Other	19	0	I'm sorry, we're no longer taking reservations. Nobody can eat here. You'll have to leave now.	[]
Other	21	0	No, I'm sorry. You can't see this movie. Nobody can see this movie. I can't even go in.	[]
Other	12	0	Out! Nobody is allowed into Gracy's anymore! Get out of here!	[]
Other	11	0	Amazing. Eric Cartman is surely the financial genius of our time.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Oh... Oohh-Ohuhughughhh...	[]
Other	5	0	Kyle? Kyle?  Get the doctor!	[]
Cartman	6	1	Eh!  Goddamnit, stop running into me!	['goddamnit']
Kenny	2	0	(Woohoo!)  (Heeheehee!!)	[]
Cartman	2	0	AGH!  DAAGGHHHH!!	[]
Other	13	0	My God, look at it, Chris! That kid completely turned this place around!	[]
Other	3	0	He sure did!	[]
Other	12	0	Oh, if I could only have a park that worked like this!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Hey, there you are!	[]
Other	6	0	Oh, hello. Congratulations on your success.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Just give me my money back.	[]
Other	1	0	What?	[]
Cartman	11	0	I changed my mind! I don't want your stupid park!	[]
Other	5	0	...But it's doing great!	[]
Cartman	12	2	You call this great?! I call it hell! Trade me back, goddamnit!	['hell', 'goddamnit']
Other	10	0	You bet! I'll go get your money right now.	[]
Other	7	0	Daddy, daddy, can we ride the rockets?	[]
Cartman	8	2	GODDAMNIT, GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY!!!	['goddamnit', 'fuck']
Cartman	8	2	GODDAMNIT, GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY!!!	['goddamnit', 'fuck']
Other	7	0	Isn't he responding at all, doctor?	[]
Other	39	0	I'm sorry. Your son appears to be losing the battle. I'm afraid that the hemorrhoid has spread to his lungs. Normally, the body would fight the infection, but he's... he's just... given up on life.	[]
Other	5	0	But then... are you saying...?	[]
Other	15	0	There's nothing I can do. Little fella's just... lost his will to live.	[]
Other	8	0	Oh Kyle! Kyle, you've got to fight!	[]
Cartman	11	1	Good riddance, you stupid park! You can all kiss my ass!	['ass']
Other	4	0	Excuse me? Eric Cartman?	[]
Cartman	1	0	Yeah?	[]
Other	29	0	I'm Frank Garrett with the IRS. You haven't kept records of your income or payout, and there's a five hundred thousand dollar discrepancy.  Seize the assets.	[]
Cartman	6	0	He-hey, that's my money!	[]
Other	23	0	There's also the lawsuit of the little boy who died in your park. The family's entitled to the rest of this.	[]
Cartman	7	0	What?! Kenny?! He dies all the time!	[]
Other	17	0	You still owe thirteen thousand dollars more than this, Mr. Cartman. We'll see you in court.	[]
Cartman	8	1	Ye-You can't take my money, Goddamnit!	['goddamnit']
Other	16	0	We know how well your park is doing; you'll make it back in no time.	[]
Cartman	24	0	No! But I don't... ah... ah...  Hey! Hey Mr. Fun, I changed my mind. I need the park to make my money back.	[]
Other	3	0	Nohoho way, Jose!	[]
Cartman	16	0	But I'm getting sued now. If I don't have the park, I lose everything!	[]
Other	10	0	I don't care, said Pierre. I'm from France.	[]
Cartman	6	0	This can't be happening! AGGGHH!!	[]
