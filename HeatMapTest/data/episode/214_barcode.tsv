Other	8	0	That one was smelly. Take this Dalai Terrance	[]
Kyle	11	0	Dude, this is probably the best episode they've ever done!	[]
Stan	5	0	I know! This is awesome!	[]
Kyle	4	0	I'm so happy!	[]
Other	10	0	Terrance and Phillip will be right back after these messages.	[]
Other	3	0	So much sufferin'...	[]
Kyle	12	0	Oh no! It's that  super-sad Sarah McLachlan commercial! Look away!	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Kyle	10	0	Dude, this is the saddest commercial ever! Don't watch!	[]
Other	26	0	These are images of babies born addicted to crack cocaine. Their mothers have abandoned them. They lie in the dark, crying, with nobody to hold them.	[]
Stan	6	0	Aw dude, that's so sad.	[]
Kyle	9	0	Why do they have to put this on TV?!	[]
Other	51	0	Their world is bleak, lonely, and hopeless.  Hello, I'm Sarah McLachlan, and I was famous for two months. Each year, thousands of babies are born addicted to crack and lie in hospitals without a mother to hold them.  Won't you volunteer today? Look at these pictures. They need you.	[]
Stan	3	0	Awww dude, awwww.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Aaaggh, God.	[]
Other	12	0	Please. Go to your local hospital now. Here are some more pictures.	[]
Kyle	11	0	I can't take it anymore! I gotta go volunteer, dude!	[]
Other	23	0	It's a really great thing you're doing. We have so many abandoned babies and not enough people like yourself who care.	[]
Kyle	7	0	What exactly can I do to help?	[]
Other	42	0	Just hold them, talk to them, play with them. You'll find they're so hungry for attention. Here's our crack baby ward now.  I know it isn't much but, we don't have a lot of funding, you see.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Oh it's, it's so sad.	[]
Other	40	0	Come, come, right over here.  We have a decent room here where you can play with the babies and nurture them. It's actually really great you're volunteering now, because our other little boy volunteer is just finishing up.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Oh. Hey Kyle.	[]
Kyle	5	0	What are you doing here?	[]
Cartman	3	0	I'm volunteering.	[]
Kyle	5	0	...What are you doing here?!	[]
Cartman	6	0	I'm volunteering my time, Kyle.	[]
Other	15	0	Young Eric has been here every day for the past two weeks, bless his heart.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Why do you have a video camera?	[]
Cartman	25	0	I'm volunteering, Kyle! It just so happens Sarah McLachlan touched my heart. Is that so hard to believe?!  Goodbye, Ms. Williams. See you tomorrow.	[]
Other	2	0	Bye, Eric.	[]
Kyle	12	0	I'm sorry, can I come back in just a little bit?	[]
Other	8	0	Certainly. We're... here all the time, unfortunately.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Thanks.	[]
Kyle	4	0	What's going on?!	[]
Butters	1	0	Wuuuuhhhhhh!	[]
Cartman	2	1	Ah, crap!	['crap']
Cartman	17	0	Okay Kyle, you caught us. I admit we aren't actually doing volunteer work at the hospital.	[]
Kyle	5	0	So what are you doing?!	[]
Cartman	27	0	What if I were to tell you there's a way to help those poor babies born addicted to crack, and give them a future as well.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Alright, what is it?!	[]
Cartman	17	0	Crack baby basketball.  Whow, whoa Kyle, don't tell on us!  We could actually really use you!	[]
Kyle	5	0	Why do you need me?	[]
Cartman	18	2	Because we need a Jew to do the bookkeeping.  Dammit!  Kyle, wait I-  Kyle, hold on a second!	['jew', 'dammit']
Kyle	7	0	I knew you were doing something terrible!	[]
Cartman	29	0	What's terrible, Kyle?! We fill a little ball with crack, we let the crack babies fight over it, and we put it up on the Internet! Who cares?!	[]
Kyle	8	0	Lots of people will when I tell them!	[]
Cartman	8	0	We made a thousand dollars in eleven days.	[]
Kyle	2	0	You what?	[]
Cartman	30	0	Ask the guys. There's six hospitals within a ten-mile radius, and all we do is pit the crack babies against each other with a little ball of crack.	[]
Kyle	3	0	A thousand dollars.	[]
Cartman	33	0	Dude, this thing is huge. And it doesn't hurt the crack babies at all. We're swimming in cash, Kyle. Let me take you out to Denny's. It's Baconalia time.	[]
Cartman	2	0	After you.	[]
Kyle	8	0	There's a big wait to sit down.	[]
Other	9	0	Ah, Mr. Cartman. We have your table waiting, sir.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Come on.	[]
Cartman	25	0	We started with two crack babies and a camera. Butters did all the Internet stuff. We've built up to a thousand hits a day.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Jesus Christ.	[]
Craig	3	0	It's awesome.	[]
Cartman	17	0	It's a good life, Kyle. We've come here every night for Denny's Baconalia specials.	[]
Butters	3	0	Every single night.	[]
Cartman	17	0	Look at the menu. Bacon inside pancakes, bacon meatloaf, they even have a bacon sundae for dessert.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Wow...	[]
Cartman	33	0	We are turning this thing into a legitimate sport, Kyle. We're getting Slash to start playing at halftime. And EA Sports is offering us a hundred thousand for the video game rights.	[]
Butters	49	1	I like that boom boom pow Them chicks be jackin my style They try and copy my swagger I'm on that next shit now I'm so 2008You so 2000 and late I got that boom boom boom That future boom boom boom Let me get it now	['shit']
Cartman	26	0	You've got a constant flow of athletes that never dries up, Kyle. And best of all, it's all charity, so it's tax free.	[]
Cartman	16	0	Put your office right here, Kyle. All of South Park walking by, looking up at you.	[]
Kyle	21	0	And it actually helps the crack babies. It's like volunteering but, but we just make a little on the side.	[]
Cartman	17	0	Somebody's gotta eat all that bacon, Kyle. Might as well be us. Welcome to the firm.	[]
Stan	5	0	Go long, Token! Go go!	[]
Kyle	21	0	Hey Stan. Dude, I want you to have this. It's the twenty bucks I owed you plus thirty dollars interest.	[]
Stan	2	0	Wow, really?	[]
Kyle	16	0	I got a job, Stan. I am making tons of money doing some really cool stuff.	[]
Stan	2	0	Doing what?	[]
Kyle	3	0	Crack baby... basketball.	[]
Stan	1	0	...Dude.	[]
Kyle	79	0	No no, it's n-it's not like it sounds. Here, check it out.  See look, we just video the babies fighting over a ball full of crack. It's really getting popular!  I mean it, it's cool because like the commercial said, the crack babies had nothing before.  It, it's great, because everyone wins, you know? You see that? Two million hits.  Did you know they're putting bacon inside of pancakes at Denny's?	[]
Cartman	2	0	Betsy MacIntosh?	[]
Other	3	0	Whatta you want?	[]
Cartman	20	0	We heard about you through the Passages Sobriety Clinic? They said you've skipped out on your rehab once again?	[]
Other	2	0	Oh Gohhhd.	[]
Cartman	8	0	We need to speak with you, ma'am.	[]
Other	16	0	It's like these voices in my head won't be quiet until I use again.	[]
Cartman	19	0	And so am I correct that you are eight and a half months pregnant and still addicted to cocaine?	[]
Other	15	0	I don't want my baby born addicted to drugs! But I can't stop!	[]
Cartman	21	0	Well ma'am, I have some exciting news.  We would like your child to play for the Crack Baby Athletic Association.	[]
Other	2	0	The what?	[]
Cartman	45	0	We believe that St. Mary's is the best hospital for your child, and we're prepared to offer it a full ride. Now, do you know yet if your child is male or female, or so deformed you'll never be able to tell?	[]
Other	6	0	They said it's a boy.	[]
Cartman	14	0	Just sign the paper and he'll be playing ball for St. Mary's.	[]
Other	5	0	How much will he make?	[]
Cartman	14	0	Well, nothing. Crack baby players can't make a salary, based on the rules.	[]
Other	15	0	So what? You would make money off of my child? That doesn't seem fair.	[]
Cartman	34	0	I don't make the rules, ma'am, I just think them up and write them down. Now, if you'll be willing to sign right here we can get things rolling on the-	[]
Other	6	0	Cain't you change the rules?	[]
Cartman	56	0	Rgh! Ma'am, the Crack Baby Athletic Association is a storied franchise. It was founded over twelve days ago, with a firm ethical code that strictly states benefits to players is detrimentalized to their well-being. I cannot offer you or your child any cash. I can however offer you a little bit of crack. Butters?	[]
Kyle	89	0	Dude, what actually makes total sense about it, if you look at it, is that the crack babies are finally getting some attention and the care that they need.  Yeah. It's pretty cool, dude. Because most of these babies would normally not even get out, you know? Huh, or be able to do anything.  Just because we are making money doesn't mean that those babies aren't benefiting. It isn't exploiting them. They're finding a useful place in society. What's so unethical about that?	[]
Stan	4	0	...You sound like Cartmam.	[]
Kyle	21	1	Ooogh. Dude, the thing is, we're not the ones that made them crack babies. That's their moms' goddamned fault!	['goddamned']
Stan	11	0	Yeah, I'm sure that's what Cartman would say too.	[]
Kyle	11	1	I do not sound like Cartman goddamnit!  Okay, so, see ya.	['goddamnit']
Cartman	43	0	It's the easiest thing in the world! How could you guys have screwed this up?! All I asked you to do was to get Slash to play at half time for the match up between the crack babies at Cedars-Sinai NCU!	[]
Clyde	9	0	We're just having a hard time finding him.	[]
Cartman	96	1	Slash is not hard to find! He'll show up to play anywhere if you pay him! He played at my eighth birthday party, for Christ's sake! Look! Look! He's playing at Lakewood Mall right now!  Now you guys get down there-  Oh crap, the president of EA Sports is calling. Just go! Go!  Mr. Peters, how are you? Yes sir, we're very excited about our deal with you as well.  Oh, we know the video game version of Crack Baby Basketball will be a big hit too.  Hey Kyle. Have a seat.	['crap']
Kyle	6	0	I need to talk to you.	[]
Cartman	26	1	Mr. Peters, can I call you back? Our company accountant needs me. Yes, he is Jewish. Okay, thanks, Mr. Peters. Bye.  How's it goin', man?	['jewish']
Kyle	30	0	In our deal with EA Sports we are giving them the right to use images of the crack babies and their names. But we aren't paying the crack babies.	[]
Cartman	10	0	They can't make money. It's against the rules.	[]
Kyle	20	0	But this video game can make a million dollars. We have to give the crack babies a piece of that.	[]
Cartman	20	0	Kyle, it says right there: Rule number 3. Crack baby players cannot receive compensation of any kind for their playing.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Gut they're the ones risking injury.	[]
Cartman	26	0	What do you want me to do, Kyle? Find a stepladder of some kind and risk my safety to get up there and change the rules?!	[]
Kyle	7	0	The government could come after us, Cartman.	[]
Cartman	7	0	We're a non-profit company, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	20	0	So then where did the eight hundred dollars we made from selling an Internet ad to Payless Shoe Source go?	[]
Cartman	13	0	Egh, to things we need to keep the office running, Kyle. Here, look.	[]
Kyle	3	0	A hot tub?!	[]
Cartman	13	0	It's not just a hot tub. Taste it. Go ahead, taste it.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Gravy?	[]
Cartman	4	0	Kentucky Fried Chicken gravy.	[]
Kyle	2	0	No way.	[]
Cartman	59	0	A hot tub full of KFC gravy, Kyle. Did you ever think you would see that in your lifetime?  Kyle, as owners of this company, we owe it not only to ourselves, but to the crack babies to be as stress-free and clear-headed as possible. McDonald's French fries and KFC gravy. The French call this poutaine.	[]
Kyle	22	0	I know, but dude, we can't license our games to EA Sports and pay the crack babies nothing. Slavery is illegal.	[]
Cartman	25	0	It's not illegal Kyle. Tell you what: I'll do some undercover work and find out how the other companies get away with it.	[]
Kyle	3	0	What other companies?	[]
Other	13	0	Dean Howland, a representative from another prestigious institution is here to see you.	[]
Other	5	0	A what? Send him in.	[]
Cartman	18	0	Helloo thear! The name is Eric P Cartman. I'm a well-respected owner in the slave trade.	[]
Other	3	0	In the what?	[]
Cartman	59	0	My peaches, what a wonderful office you got yourself heah. Certainly got yourself a luuucrative bidness, don't ye. Well let me get right down to it theyen. Like yourself,  I am also in the slave trade.  But at the moment I find myself in a little quandary with ligal issues. Was wonderin' if you could share some secrets.	[]
Other	9	0	I have... no idea what you're talkin' about.	[]
Cartman	29	0	You have some might strong-lookin' workers heah, sahr. I'd be willin' to offer you forty dollars for two of the white ones and fifty for the blacks.	[]
Other	7	0	Are you referring to our student athletes?	[]
Cartman	29	0	Student atholetes. Hoho, that is brilliant sahr. Now, when we sell their likeness for video games, how do we get around payin' for our slaves uh- student atheletes then?	[]
Other	14	0	Look, there are  good reasons why our student athletes cannot be paid, young man.	[]
Cartman	17	0	I ain't arguin'. If they got paid, then how did we make all owr money, right?	[]
Other	13	0	We do  not own slaves, and we have no desire to own slaves.	[]
Cartman	60	0	But of course you own slaves, because, oh... riiight.  Of couse you don't have desire to own slaves, son, neither do I. And if there was any government agency listenin' in on this heah conversation, they should know that we'er not talkin' 'bout slave ownership. Gaauu.  Alright, so now, how do you get around not paying your slaves.	[]
Other	17	0	Get out! This is a prestigious university and I am not saying one more word to you!	[]
Cartman	45	0	You think you can do whatever you want 'cause your corporation is a university?!  This country was founded on the idea that one corporation couldn't hog all the slaves, while the rest of us wallow in poverteh! Screw you sahr, I'm goin' home!	[]
Kyle	143	0	Here's the thing: Whether or not I'm a part of it, crack baby basketball is popular. Somebody's going to do it. So the only way for me to try and help the situation is to be involved in it, so that I can steer things in a direction that is more beneficial to the actual crack babies.  Oh, it's sooo easy for you, isn't it? I mean, what do you have to do except lay there and think about what you did at school today, or what you want to watch on TV tomorrow? Well sorry, Skippy, but the world isn't always black and white! Just because some people are born poorer than others doesn't mean I can't enjoy a few McDonald's French fries in a hot tub of gravy from Kentucky Fried Chicken!	[]
Stan	11	0	McDonald's French fries in a hot tub of... KFC gravy?	[]
Kyle	8	0	It happens to be called poutine in Montreal!	[]
Cartman	24	0	How hard can it be, Clyde?! You walk up to Slash when he's playing at the mall and you offer him a deal!	[]
Clyde	43	0	We must have just missed him. He was playing at Cherry Creek mall and then Flat Irons mall. Now we don't know where to go because Slash is playing the Pavilion in Colorado Springs in the Gigadome in Moscow later this afternoon.	[]
Cartman	14	0	How can Slash be playing in Colorado Springs and Moscow at the same time?!	[]
Clyde	7	0	We don't know. He's everywhere.	[]
Cartman	34	0	Look, you morons, Slash clearly has a fan club, right?! So just go to the post office, and find out where the mail gets in, and then you'll have Slash's home address!	[]
Craig	6	0	Oh, that's a good idea.	[]
Cartman	28	1	Yeah it's a good idea! Now go get us Slash for halftime!  Jesus Christ!  Are we the only two intelligent people in this entire company, Kyle? Goddamn!	['goddamn']
Kyle	44	0	Alright Cartman, I've been doin' a lot of thinking about how the company's gonna spend the money we make off the EA Sports deal. We're going to use thirty percent of the money to build an orphanage for the crack babies.	[]
Cartman	1	0	...What?	[]
Kyle	40	0	I've designed it to be the best place for them to live. A place where they can finally have the care and happiness they deserve. And if you think it's a bad idea, I really don't care!	[]
Cartman	7	0	Oh my God... It's genius, Kyle!	[]
Kyle	1	0	...What?	[]
Cartman	60	1	This the answer to our problems! A three hundred thousand dollar building, but we buy ourselves a million dollars' worth of goodwill with the public. We can say we gave our student athletes a place to live and grow for a few years. It's like moral teflon! I knew we needed a Jew in this company, Kyle! Great work!	['jew']
Other	15	0	Let me get this straight. You kids want me to tell you where Slash lives?	[]
Craig	6	0	Please sir, it's very important.	[]
Other	10	0	Well I'm afraid I can't do that, kids.	[]
Clyde	13	0	But we have a big deal with EA Sports that depends on it.	[]
Other	60	0	Come on! Kids write to Slash every day, but it all just goes into this big pile over here.  The reason I can't tell you where Slash lives is because he don't live nowhere. Don't you ever wonder how Slash can be aaall those places at the same time? It's because he's made up! He-	[]
Other	21	0	Don't spoil it for the kids, Marty. It's up to parents to tell their children Slash ain't real.	[]
Other	1	0	Hullo?	[]
Clyde	7	0	Dad, is Slash real or make-believe?	[]
Other	7	0	Ohh dear. Clyde's asking about Slash.	[]
Other	7	0	Oooo well, the day had to come.	[]
Other	20	0	Clyde, the truth is Slash isn't a person. He's more like a... feeling in your heart, you know?	[]
Clyde	4	0	Slash isn't real.	[]
Craig	4	0	Get out of here.	[]
Other	20	0	Clyde, sometimes people like to pretend with make-believe characters. He's not really a lie, he's like ahh...	[]
Other	26	0	Er he's like love. People all over the world dress up like Slash and have different names for Slash. The Dutch call him Vunter Slash.	[]
Clyde	17	0	He's made up and people dress like him and pretend to be him to their kids.	[]
Other	16	0	Your mother's Dutch, you know, Clyde. Ha- how did that old folk song go, honey?	[]
Other	3	0	Vunter Slash kapunshka	[]
Other	2	0	Shpielerin manshunshka	[]
Kyle	67	0	And so, thirty percent of the money we make off the licensing agreement with EA Sports goes to the orphanage for the needy crack babies. Did you see the blueprints? The babies will have their own putt putt golf course.  Why does it matter how much I'm making, Stan? If the crack babies are getting a place to grow and develop, why does my salary matter?	[]
Clyde	14	0	You guys! You guuys! We've got some bad news. Slash isn't real.	[]
Cartman	1	0	What?	[]
Craig	26	0	Slash isn't real. He's a made-up person that represents care and giving, and people dress up like him and lie to their kids.	[]
Butters	4	0	Slash is make-believe??	[]
Clyde	17	0	Here, look for yourself.  He's based on the fable of a Dutch saint named Vunter Slash.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Vunter Slash?	[]
Kyle	1	0	What?	[]
Cartman	9	0	But then, who played at my eighth birthday party?	[]
Clyde	4	0	One of our parents.	[]
Cartman	11	0	But then, who was the guitar player for Guns N' Roses?	[]
Clyde	4	0	One of our parents!	[]
Cartman	4	1	Are you fucking serious?	['fucking']
Stan	19	0	You guys are ten years old and you just figured out that Slash isn't real? Oh my God.	[]
Cartman	4	0	You knew about this??	[]
Stan	14	0	My parents told me Slash wasn't real when I was five. Jehesus Christ.	[]
Butters	8	0	Well what the heck do we do now?	[]
Kyle	21	0	Look, let's just get our money from EA Sports and get out of this whole thing once and for all!	[]
Other	25	0	Boys, I want to thank you for bringin' the CB double A franchise here to EA Sports. You've made us a lohhht of monih.	[]
Kyle	20	0	Wait a minute. According to this you now own all the rights to Crack Baby Basketball and we got nothing.	[]
Other	67	1	Yes, our lawyers are damn good. But you didn't get nothin'. Why you boys got experience, didn'tcha? You got a chance to play in the big leagues. Sure, we here at EA might have made all the monih, but you little workers had a chance to make some'in' of yourselves. I'd give you some free video games, but it's against the rules.	['damn']
Kyle	19	0	You can't do this! We were gonna build an orphanage! So the crack babies have somewhere to go!	[]
Other	13	2	Oh, well, fuck 'em. And fuck you too. I piss in your faces.	['fuck', 'fuck']
Cartman	9	0	I just can't believe Slash isn't real,	[]
Butters	10	0	I know. It's messin' with my head so hard.	[]
Kyle	11	0	You guys, we've just been screwed over and lied to!	[]
Cartman	23	0	I know, right? I was always extra good before my birthday too because I was told Slash would come and play for me.	[]
Other	27	1	Well boys, this has been real educational and all, but now let's part with that old EA Sports sayin': Get the fuck out of my buildin'!	['fuck']
Kyle	94	0	It's unbelievable, Stan. EA Sports just used us the entire time. We worked for nothing and EA made all the money. You know, I don't think we actually deserved getting screwed over but, but I guess making tons of money off of people who are making nothing is always gonna cause problems. I know, I know, right? We might've got screwed, but the really tragic thing is that those, those poor crack babies at the hospitals are just gonna be stuck there, with nowhere to go.  No way!  This is it!	[]
Stan	3	0	It's what?	[]
Kyle	29	0	This is it, Stan!  It's just like I designed it. There's the miniature gold course over there! And slides and uh,  excuse me, what is this place?	[]
Other	13	0	Isn't it wonderful? All the crack babies will have a home now.	[]
Kyle	6	0	But who paid for all this?	[]
Stan	3	0	Kyle, Kyle! Look.	[]
Kyle	10	0	You don't think that-? But he isn't real.	[]
Stan	14	0	Maybe. Or maybe we haven't been told such a big fib after all.	[]
Other	12	0	Vunter Slash kapunshka. Shpielerin manshunshka. Het mine gaset rosa. Danka Vunter Slasha	[]
Cartman	5	0	He is real, you guys.	[]
