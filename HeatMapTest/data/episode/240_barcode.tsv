Cartman	8	0	Token, I wasn't on that jury. Okay?	[]
Token	2	0	...What jury?	[]
Cartman	22	0	This grudge that you're holding against an entire group of people should be directed at just a few, not at me.	[]
Mr. Mackey	8	0	Okay Token, what are your feelings about that?	[]
Token	7	0	I don't know what to say.	[]
Cartman	85	0	I wrote a poem. Is it okay if I read my poem?  It's called I Was Not The Bullet.  I was not the bullet. I was not the gun. I was not the juror that set the shooter free. I was not the trigger. I was not the hate. Nor was I the judge, but still, you judge me? I was not the black family mourning for the dead. Oooo, somebody shot our children. Lordy, what we do now? I was not the verdict.	[]
Token	10	0	This isn't a poem. It doesn't even rhyme.	[]
Cartman	32	0	It's going to rhyme, Token, just hold on. I was not the shooter. I was not the gun. So Token, you should be cool while we're all here at school.	[]
Token	7	0	Can I go back to class now?	[]
Mr. Mackey	8	0	Eric, do you feel better about all this?	[]
Cartman	12	0	Yeah, yeah I do. I think we really had a breakthrough here.	[]
Mr. Mackey	3	0	Okay, thanks Token.	[]
Cartman	12	0	It's gonna be okay. I think we're all safe now.	[]
Other	15	0	We are Cows, proud and true! Come on, South Park, moo moo moo! Goooo Cows!	[]
Other	40	0	Ooookay, thank you, cheerleaders. That was very nice. Ahhh, next we have a student who would like to perform an original rap song,  based on his award-winning poem, I Was Not The Bullet, with backup music by Butters Stotch.	[]
Other	73	1	Black or white, it's alright. Black or white, let's not fight. I was not the bullet. I was not the gun. I was not the jury, so don't blame me, son! James my man was wrong (It's not our fault). James my man was wrong (It's not Eric's fault). Black or white, it's alright. Black or white, let's not fight. White people say Ho-oh!	['ho']

Cartman	8	0	The outbreak's starting! Fly the plane now!	[]
Other	12	1	Maybe now you can tell us what the hell is going on?!	['hell']
Cartman	30	0	The e-... The end of the world? We've got one shot and one shot only and that's to find a place where the contagion won't reach us!	[]
Other	16	0	What contagion? My wife didn't get on the plane.  Take this plane back to Denver!	[]
Cartman	13	0	You don't understand. There's no Denver left to go back to!	[]
Other	8	1	Alright what the hell is going on here?!	['hell']
Other	20	0	We don't know anything. First there was talk of a hijacking, then reports of an outbreak of some kind.	[]
Other	12	0	Confirmed report of panic in a rural town in the Colorado Rockies!	[]
Other	15	0	Sir, the pilot of flight 82 wants an update. They're asking permission to land.	[]
Other	20	1	Stall them. I don't want that plane landing anywhere until we know what the hell we're dealing with!	['hell']
Other	24	0	Sir, you'd better look at this. This was found in the airport lavatory. It seems to be a survival guide of some kind.	[]
Other	3	0	Survival of what?	[]
Other	12	0	From the looks of it, a contagion outbreak of the worst kind.	[]
Other	3	0	Oh my God.	[]
Other	12	1	DA43 to tower, please advise!  Damnit! They aren't telling me anything!	['damnit']
Other	7	0	Do you think it's a virus?	[]
Other	21	0	Virus, bacteria, either way we're all dead! Find out if he thinks it's safe to land in Los Angeles.	[]
Other	12	0	What about Los Angeles? Can we take the plane to Los Angeles?	[]
Cartman	33	0	Not a chance. By now most of the urban cities will be compromised. This whole things from city to city. We need to go somewhere the trend won't take hold. Like Iceland.	[]
Other	8	0	This plane won't make it to Iceland!	[]
Other	6	1	You got a better idea, asshole?!	['asshole']
Cartman	6	0	Everyone quiet! I have to think!	[]
Other	4	0	Yes, let him think!	[]
Cartman	12	0	I can't think here. I need a magazine and a toilet.	[]
Other	6	0	Oh, I'm just finishing up.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Nah!	[]
Other	1	0	Hey!	[]

Other	20	0	Engine engine #9 running down Chicago Line, if the train should jump the track do you want your money back?	[]
Butters	1	0	Yes.	[]
Other	5	0	Y-E-S spells yes-	[]
Mr. Mackey	52	0	Now, Token, what you need to understand, m'kay, is that a school assembly is not the time and the place to be yellin' and causin' distractions. M'kay? If there's somebody causin' you problems, then we don't disrupt the assembly, m'kay. You come and you talk to me.	[]
Token	7	0	He's just out looking for trouble.	[]
Mr. Mackey	67	0	Well that's your side of it, Token, but you know Eric has his side as well. Have you thought about maybe writin' him a poem? M'kay? Write E- write Eric a poem, tell him how you feel.  You know, m'kay? Well I'm tellin' you, Token, you let it go, and he'll let it go, and it'll all be fine. Can ya?	[]
Other	32	0	No, the plane crashed. We're in the Colorado mountains somewhere.  Matt? Matt?!  My husband. He said the outbreak was all over the news, but everything was totally fine where he was.	[]
Cartman	15	0	Totally fine? Then it hasn't happened yet. Oh my God, we still have time!	[]
Other	14	0	Help! Help me!  Please, I have two little girls in Chicago. Please find them!	[]
Cartman	13	0	It's okay. We have reason to believe it hasn't spread yet.	[]
Other	6	0	Then you have to stop it.	[]
Other	1	0	Yes!	[]
Other	13	0	And there must be... a Patient Zero... The person it all starts from.	[]
Cartman	4	0	His name is Token.	[]
Other	10	0	We have to kill him, before he infects everyone else!	[]
Cartman	11	0	I won't do it! He used to be my friend!	[]
Other	29	0	You have to! You have to be strong. If you can stop this- if you can save the world- then you have to do it.  Promise me! Promise... me!	[]
Cartman	15	0	Alright. I promise. I won't let the black people riot and destroy the world.	[]
Other	4	0	Thank you-wait, what?	[]
Other	6	0	Oh my God! Oh my God!	[]
Cartman	10	0	We're gonna live through this! Do you hear me?!	[]
Other	1	0	Yes!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Come on!	[]
Other	29	0	First, a wave of 911 calls about a virus, and now a plane has apparently gone down in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. Is this the beginning of the end?	[]
Butters	4	0	Oh boy! Zombie apocalypse!	[]
Other	36	0	The government is looking for a Patient Zero, going only off of this sketch which was found in a notebook at the airport. Anyone with information regarding Patient Zero is asked to contact the authorities immediately.	[]
Butters	2	0	Holy Moly.	[]
Other	4	0	Can I help you?	[]
Cartman	21	0	Stay by the window! Tell me if anything changes!  I need something that can shoot with complete accuracy from a distance.	[]
Other	17	0	Alright, you want a rifle!  well, like this .22 caliber.  What is it you intend to shoot?	[]
Cartman	2	0	A person.	[]
Other	8	0	...You mean a person who's threatening you?	[]
Cartman	4	0	Threatening all of us!	[]
Other	6	0	Please, please hurry! It's important!	[]
Other	21	0	Well, you should be fine so long as the person breaks into your house and is an immediate threat to you.	[]
Cartman	14	0	What?! How am I supposed to get a person to break into my house?!	[]
Other	29	0	You can't shoot someone who threatens you just out on the street. Well unless of course you're in a state that has a stand your ground law.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Stand my ground?	[]
Other	7	0	Please! We're running out of time!	[]
Other	25	0	See now with a stand your ground law, you could legally shoot somebody that's threatening you whether they're in your house or not.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Yes yes, that's what I need! I'll take that!	[]
Other	18	0	No, no, see, you've gotta be IN a state with a stand your ground law, like Florida.	[]
Cartman	32	0	This is hopeless. How am I supposed to shoot Token with all these stupid rules?!  Wait a minute. I can't shoot Token,  but I can shoot anyone I want in Florida?	[]
Other	7	0	So long as they're threatening you.	[]
Other	12	0	What?! What is it, please?! Hurry, my husband might still be alive!	[]
Cartman	30	0	The other way to stop the outbreak. Token isn't the only Patient Zero. The outbreak won't happen if... we shoot George Zimmerman. We have to get to Florida!	[]
Cartman	15	0	Let's go, let's go! Let's move move move move! Let's go!	[]
Other	6	0	This plane is going to Baltimore.	[]
Cartman	27	0	If we don't get to Florida there's not going to be a Baltimore left!  Black guy in the back!  Alight, now let's find Zimmerman.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Put this on. We have to stay hidden from here out.	[]
Other	6	0	What are we going to do?	[]
Cartman	19	0	I'm going to flush out Patient Zero. And you're gonna shoot him. It's the only way.	[]
Other	6	0	What if he attacks us first?	[]
Cartman	9	0	Don't worry, nobody can see us wearing black.	[]
Other	15	0	I haven't had the time to thank you, for doing what you've d-	[]
Other	4	0	Eat your breakfast, girls.	[]
Other	3	0	Where's Daddy?	[]
Other	11	0	You can eat without your father in the room. Now hurry.	[]
Other	1	0	Daddy!	[]
Other	19	0	Good morning, girls.  Save Daddy any pancakes? Look at that? Six A.M. and my family is already smiling.	[]
Other	10	0	How did I get such a perfect husband, Geroge Zimmerman?	[]
Other	9	0	And how did I get such a beautiful wife?	[]
Other	4	0	I love you, Dad.	[]
Other	11	0	I love you too, Princess. I love both of you, equally.	[]
Other	13	0	Nothing can ever go wrong, so long as we all have each other.	[]
Other	43	0	Is there any hope for stopping the zombie apocalypse?  CNN has just received word that the government has learned the identity of Patient Zero.  The nine year old threat to humanity has been tracked down, and measures are being taken to stop him.	[]
Other	6	0	Daddy, what's a Patient Zero?	[]
Other	7	0	Hello, Mr. Zimmerman. Your country needs you.	[]
Other	6	0	What do you need from me?	[]
Other	11	0	We...  need you to shoot a young African-American for us.	[]
Other	4	0	I gave that up.	[]
Other	21	0	You're the best, Zimmerman. We just need you to do it one more time, for the security of the world!	[]
Other	8	1	Damnit, I have a wife and kids now.	['damnit']
Other	25	0	Then do it for your family!  This is about protecting people, Zimmerman! Keeping our streets safe so that our children are free to go out...	[]
Other	5	0	Something's wrong.  Look out!	[]
Other	8	0	My God, I didn't even see him.	[]
Other	3	0	Nice work, Zimmerman.	[]
Other	4	0	Are you guys okay?	[]
Other	4	0	What was that, Daddy?	[]
Other	3	0	More needless violence.	[]
Other	11	0	Nonsense, you did what you had to. You're a hero.	[]
Other	27	0	That may be true, but I'll have to live with this the rest of my life. Even though I'll be walking around a free man.	[]
Other	12	0	Hey, wait a minute. This kid isn't black, he's white.	[]
Other	2	0	Wait, what?	[]
Other	1	0	Guilty!	[]
Other	55	0	The zombie apocalypse... is over. All the panic, crashing planes and chaos appear to have, for some reason, died with George Zimmerman. And as for the little boy who was so mercilessly gunned down?  Although he survived the shooting, his wishes are to remain anonymous, giving the hospital only the nickname... Brad Pitt. ...But cooler.	[]
Stan	9	0	That sure wasn't much of a zombie apocalypse.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Yeah, that sucked.	[]
Butters	17	0	Well, at least I'll bet Token's glad it's over with. Aren't you, Token?	[]
Cartman	15	0	Hey Token. ...Sup bro? ...How's it goin' dude? I know how it feels now.	[]
Token	10	1	You made everyone think I'm a fucking Patient Zero!	['fucking']
Cartman	7	0	Dude, I'm saying I'm sorry.	[]
Token	2	0	So what?!	[]
Cartman	9	0	Uh oh.  Sounds like you're still angry, Token.	[]
Token	2	1	Fuck you!	['fuck']
Cartman	58	2	Alright Token, come on! This is ridiculous. I know you totally wanna kick my ass right now. You'd like to walk right up and punch me in the face, but what's that gonna solve? I've got a way better idea.  First bump?  Come on dude, fist bump. Bump that shit bro. Be the bigger person.	['ass', 'shit']
Token	1	0	Oh!	[]
Cartman	34	0	That was, he was on my ground. You all saw that, right? Everything inside the red line is mine.  Inside the red line is, that's- that's my ground. He was on it.	[]
Other	1	0	Daddy!	[]
Other	7	0	What's up girls? Daddy did it!	[]
Cartman	11	0	Ugh! Oh man. The ending to that movie was so terrible.	[]
Kyle	12	0	You're having nightmares about the ending to World War Z again?	[]
Cartman	3	0	Yeah. So bad.	[]
Kyle	13	0	That's what bothering you? Not the fact that you're a murderer?	[]
Cartman	5	0	Jury found me innocent, Kyle!	[]
Kyle	4	0	You're a murderer.	[]
Cartman	6	0	You interrupt people when they talk.	[]
Mr. Mackey	8	0	Eric Cartman to the counselor's office please.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Oh man!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Oh boy.	[]
Mr. Mackey	39	0	Have a seat, Eric. Now boys, I for one am sick and tired of this little feud you're having, okay? This has clearly gone too far, and you owe each other an apology or you're gettin' detention!	[]
Token	5	0	An apology?! He shot me!	[]
Mr. Mackey	8	0	Well he was technically standing his ground, Token.	[]
Cartman	13	0	Yeah Token, that's the law! Everything inside the red line is lava.	[]
Token	8	1	Well it's a pretty fucking stupid law!	['fucking']
Cartman	3	0	Token, calm down.	[]
Token	12	1	And why does standing your ground not apply to fucking white people?!	['fucking']
Cartman	6	0	Oh God, here we go again!	[]
