Other	53	0	My fellow heroes, tonight I stopped three murders from happening.  I don't know why, but we're seeing a huge trend in crime. We have to find out the source of this evil. Something big is about to happen, and it is up to Coon and Friends to stop it.  Yes, Toolshed.	[]
Other	10	0	Why do we have to be called Coon and Friends?	[]
Other	1	0	...What?	[]
Other	12	0	We all fight crime together. How come we're just your friends?	[]
Other	9	0	Yeah. We wanna be called The Extreme Avenger League.	[]
Other	7	0	Yeah! That's right. Extreme Avenger League!	[]
Other	10	0	I told you, TupperWear, Extreme Avenger League doesn't work.	[]
Other	2	0	Why not?	[]
Other	11	0	It's confusing! The Coon is a brand people already know.	[]
Other	8	0	Why can't it be Mosquito and Friends?	[]
Other	7	1	Nobody's fucking heard of you, Mosquito!	['fucking']
Other	2	0	Have, so.	[]
Other	47	0	Look guys, we need to find out what's causing the crime wave in this city.  Mysterion, you and the Human Kite get on the computer and dig up what you can. TupperWear and Mosquito, scan the news. Toolshed, you run a perimeter check with Iron Maiden.	[]
Other	1	0	Timmeh!	[]
Other	134	0	Let's work, people!  Uh, Mint-Berry Crunch, could I have a quick word with you in the debriefing chamber?  Okay, ummm, I really enjoy having you be a part of Coon and Friends and I certainly appreciate your on-time paying of dues and fees; it's just... I don't... I'm not getting your deal. I mean, exactly what is Mint-Berry Crunch supposed to mean?  I, I get that you're half man and half berry, and that you're... crunchy with some mint, but... to be a part of Coon and Friends, you have to have a clear and more... superhero kind of identity.  Mint-Berry Crunch, ummm, I'm just wondering if... maybe you need to add something else to the Mint-Berry Crunch part of your costume.	[]
Other	2	0	Like milk?	[]
Other	25	0	No, not like milk! You see, I really think we're on different pages here, Mint-Berry Crunch! It's like you don't even-	[]
Other	8	0	Coon and Friends alert. Coon and Friends alert.	[]
Other	7	0	Uh oh!  What's the alert, Mosquito?	[]
Other	10	0	There's like a big fire or something in town.	[]
Other	6	0	What? A fire? Coon volume up!	[]
Other	20	0	There's thought to be at least twenty people trapped inside the apartment building, and firefighters are having no luck.	[]
Other	17	0	My God, this is what we've been waiting for! Coon and Friends, let's head out!	[]
Other	8	0	Let's do it! Yeah! Let's go!	[]
Other	17	0	Yeah, uhh, Mint-Berry Crunch, why don't you stay here and mind the place, okay? Kewl.	[]
Other	16	0	We've got to get downtown fast, Coon Friends!  Mom, you've gotta drive us downtown!	[]
Other	16	0	Ohh, it's a little late, sweetie. Why don't you boys just keep playing downstairs?	[]
Other	13	0	Mom, you're the Coon's faithful butler! I wanna go downtown now!	[]
Other	11	0	Well, all right.  I guess I can get some groceries anyway.	[]
Other	14	0	Into the Coon Mobile, everyone! Let's just hope we get there in time!	[]
Other	10	0	All right, are you little munchkins buckled up for safety?	[]
Other	12	1	Mom, don't talk to us like that! We're fucking superheroes!	['fucking']
Other	19	0	Eric, what have we talked about with that language?! One more time and I'm not taking you anywhere!	[]
Other	10	0	Oh... I'm sorry Mom, can we go please?  Unbelievable!	[]
Other	11	0	We tried gettin' in through the back; it was no good!	[]
Other	11	0	Those people are gonna die if we don't do something!	[]
Other	7	0	Oh my goodness, it's a fire.	[]
Other	4	0	Come on, Coon Friends!	[]
Other	7	0	No- Eric, stay in the car, sweetie!	[]
Other	5	0	Can we try a helicopter?	[]
Other	11	0	The winds are too high. The chopper would burn in minutes.	[]
Other	8	0	All right, what seems to be the problem?	[]
Other	7	0	Get back, kids. It isn't safe.	[]
Other	2	0	Eric, poopsie?	[]
Other	9	0	Whatever's happening, you need help from the Coon!	[]
Other	2	0	And friends!	[]
Other	5	0	Keep those children back, Thompson!	[]
Other	6	0	Please sir, you must let us-	[]
Other	8	0	Sweetie, let the nice firemen do their job.	[]
Other	4	0	Shut! Up! Mom! God!	[]
Other	6	0	Wait. Look! Up in the sky!	[]
Other	9	0	It's him! My God, it's really him!	[]
Other	8	0	He's come to help us. Captain Hindsight!	[]
Stan	4	0	Who's Captain Hindsight?	[]
Other	50	0	Captain Hindsight, the hero of the modern age.  Once known as Jack Brolin, a reporter for the national news, the hero was born when a freak accident gave him the amazing power of extraordinary hindsight. From toxic spills to unjust wars there is no task too large for... Captain Hindsight!	[]
Other	7	0	Captain Hindsight, thank God you've come!	[]
Other	4	0	What's the skinny?	[]
Other	22	0	There's people trapped in that burning building, Captain Hindsight. And the fire is so massive we can't get to them.	[]
Other	51	0	Hmmm... You see those windows on the right side? They should have built fire escapes on those windows for the higher floors, then people could have gotten down. And then on the roof: they should have built it with a more reinforce structure, so a helicopter could have landed on it.	[]
Other	3	0	Yes, of course.	[]
Other	9	0	And then you see that building to the left?	[]
Other	1	0	Yes.	[]
Other	31	0	They shouldn't have built that there. Because now you can't park any fire trucks where you really need to.  Well, looks like my job here is done. Goodbye everyone!	[]
Other	4	0	Thank you, Captain Hindsight!	[]
Other	2	0	Thank youuu!	[]
Other	13	0	All right everyone, I guess that's it. Let's pack it up.	[]
Randy	10	0	Whoa, boy, did you hear about that fire downtown, Sharon?	[]
Other	10	0	Oh my gosh, yes! They said like 14 people died.	[]
Randy	18	0	It's just ridiculous to me that they didn't build fire escapes on those upper floors! Ridiculous!	[]
Other	21	0	Oh I know, and if you ask me, they should've built a roof with enough support to land a helicopter.	[]
Randy	3	0	I mean, hello!	[]
Stan	11	0	Hey you guys are just repeating what that hindsight guy said.	[]
Randy	28	0	Why yes, Stan. Captain Hindsight is our protector and guardian. We're just thankful he was there for that fire. And now we can all eat in peace.	[]
Other	8	0	Coon and Friends alert. Coon and Friends alert.	[]
Randy	9	1	What the hell is that?  Who put that there?	['hell']
Other	12	0	Seriously. All Coon Friends to base. Alert, you guys. I'm seriously.	[]
Stan	13	0	Mom, Dad? I I finished dinner. Can I go up to my room?	[]
Other	11	0	Well sure, Stan.  Wha- How did that thing get there, Randy?	[]
Randy	4	0	I don't know.	[]
Other	7	0	Well take it down. It's noisy.	[]
Randy	13	0	I can't. I don't know what happened to all my tools.	[]
Other	7	0	Alright, Toolshed is here. We can start.	[]
Other	13	0	Dude, who said you could put a big siren in my parents' house?	[]
Other	8	0	Yeah, I almost got in trouble for it.	[]
Other	15	0	The Coon must be able to signal his friends when a huge catastrophe breaks out.	[]
Other	6	0	So what's the huge catastrophe?	[]
Other	13	0	What's the huge-? Did you guys not see that Captain Hindsight guy?!	[]
Other	2	0	Yeah, so?	[]
Other	22	0	So there's a big superhero out there doing stuff on his own and he's NOT part of Coon and Friends!	[]
Other	2	0	Oh Jesus...	[]
Other	25	1	I've looked into it and this Captain Hindsight is everywhere. He's like some freelance butthole scab. We need to make him join us!	['butthole']
Other	17	0	Hey fellas?  Fellas, could you let me out please? It uh it's been like six days.	[]
Other	6	0	You aren't going anywhere, Chaos!	[]
Other	29	1	Yeah, but uh, but uh youuu, but you only gave me this bucket to poop in and it's full now.  And I ain't got nothin' to eat.	['poop']
Other	22	1	You've got poop, don'tcha?  Now the question is, how are we gonna get Captain Hindsight to join Coon and Friends?	['poop']
Other	15	0	Who cares if a hero doesn't want to be part of Coon and Friends?	[]
Other	2	0	I CARE!	[]
Other	20	0	Look, all we need to do is wait for the next disaster, then try to beat Hindsight to the scene.	[]
Other	20	0	There's not gonna be any worse disaster. What could possibly be worse than a fire that kills fourteen people?!	[]
Other	9	0	All right, this looks like a jolly good place.	[]
Other	6	0	Yes. Let's let her rip.	[]
Other	7	0	That's it, lads. Collect that oil!	[]
Other	4	0	Uh oh!  Oh deah.	[]
Other	9	0	Oh, don't tell me we did it again?	[]
Other	23	0	Coon and Friends alert. Coon and Friends alert.  All Coon Friends report to base. I'm so seriously. Emergency. Coon and Friends alert.	[]
Other	13	0	Good, you're all here. Take a look at this. Coon volume up!	[]
Other	25	0	It's a scene of utter despair and catastrophe. Oil from the ocean is spill out out of control, and the rescue effort seems futile.	[]
Other	12	0	It's horrible. We can't stop the oil from contaminatin' everything.	[]
Other	12	0	Our home is covered in sludge. Where are we supposed to go?	[]
Other	52	0	Git a lookie on mah scrimp heuh! Might as give ya the best scrimp this side of Louisiana and now down tuh where we all got up in our scrimp, and it ain't worth a slimy noob it ain't sold on. There, now lookit all the url on mah scrimp!	[]
Other	12	0	My God! Another oil spill could mean absolute devastation for the Gulf!	[]
Other	7	0	We've got to help those people!	[]
Other	10	0	Yes. This is definitely a job for Coon and Friends.	[]
Other	8	0	Let's pack the Gulf full of flavor!	[]
Other	8	0	Wait a minute. Look! It's Captain Hindsight!	[]
Other	2	0	Oh no!	[]
Other	6	0	What seems to be the problem?	[]
Other	20	0	It's that BP Oil rig, Captain Hindsight. It drilled into a marine sanctuary and the environment is being poisoned.	[]
Other	12	0	If we can't stop it, the spill could reach New Orleans.	[]
Other	10	0	Hmm... All right. You see where that rig is drilling?	[]
Other	1	0	Yes.	[]
Other	30	0	It's in too deep of water. They shouldn't have drilled in that deep of water, because now they can't get machines deep enough to fix the spill!	[]
Other	1	0	Aha!	[]
Other	2	0	Yesss, YESSS.	[]
Other	24	0	Now, if it's a valve that ruptured, then what they should have done is installed the backup valve in case that valve broke.	[]
Other	11	0	I believe they did install a backup safety valve, Captain Hindsight.	[]
Other	16	0	Hmmm... Right. Then they should have had a backup safety valve to that backup safety valve!	[]
Other	5	0	My God, he's right!	[]
Other	13	0	My work here is done! I'm off to fine others in need!	[]
Other	8	0	God bless you, Captain Hindsight! God bless you!!	[]
Other	12	1	Goddammit! We have got to get that guy into Coon and Friends!	['goddammit']
Other	4	0	Can I help you?	[]
Cartman	8	0	I understand this is where Captain Hindsight lives?	[]
Other	1	0	Yes?	[]
Cartman	7	0	I need to speak with him, please.	[]
Other	11	0	The captain is very busy dealing with the Gulf oil crisis.	[]
Cartman	15	0	I believe I have something that can help him deal with that oil crisis, sir.	[]
Other	10	0	Mr. Hindsight, sir.  This young man would like a word.	[]
Other	9	0	Please, sit down. What can I do for you?	[]
Cartman	35	0	Mr. Hindsight, I represent some very high-profile people,  and I've been asked to give you some really exciting news.  You, have been pre-approved to become the newest member, of Coon and Friends.	[]
Other	2	0	Of what?	[]
Cartman	43	0	I know the Coon personally, and I can tell you, being a Coon friend is the very highest honor. As you can see in those papers, your first three months of dues have actually been waived. This must be amazingly exciting for you.	[]
Other	7	0	Captain Hindsight? Captain Hindsight, please come in!	[]
Other	2	0	Go ahead.	[]
Other	13	0	The oil keeps coming out! We've got other rigs now catching fire!	[]
Other	21	0	Listen! They should have hosed down the other rigs as soon as the spill began, and that wouldn't have happened.	[]
Other	3	0	Right.  Thank you!	[]
Other	15	0	Captain Hindsight! The dolphins that those volunteers cleaned of oil, they, they're all dying!	[]
Other	17	0	Get down to the volunteers and tell them they should have used a non-bleaching cleanser! Commissioner!	[]
Other	1	0	Yes?	[]
Other	22	0	Tell Brett Favre he should have never sent actual pictures of his schlong!  It's not a blessing, it's a curse.	[]
Cartman	22	0	...So, anyways, if you wanna just start filling out the form, we'll get you enrolled in Coon and Friends right away.	[]
Other	9	0	Look, I'm sorry kid, but I work alone.	[]
Cartman	31	0	Well, see, the problem with that is there's a superhero union called Coon and Friends. But if you refuse to be a part of that union. you are a scab!	[]
Other	10	0	Get this kid out of here! I have to think!	[]
Cartman	13	0	Fine! You'll be hearing from my lawy- the Coon's lawyer, sir!	[]
Other	26	0	The BP Oil spill in the Gulf continues to get worse every day. As public anger towards the BP Company grows, their president released this statement:	[]
Other	86	1	Hello, I'm Tony Hayward, president and CEO of BP. Our accidental drilling spill again in the Gulf us a tragedy that should have never happened. And to all those affected, I want to say, we are deeply sorry.  We're sorry.  We're sorry.  We're sorry.  Sorry.  BP has taken full responsibility for cleaning up this spill in the Gulf, and in doing so, we've changed our name from Beyond Petroleum, to Dependable Petroleum.  We no longer fuck the earth, we DP it.	['fuck']
Other	60	0	Gentlemen, my attempts to recruit Captain Hindsight into Coon and Friends have been unsuccessful, but I believe I've come up with a solution. Coon Vision on!  All we need to do is get pictures of Captain Hindsight naked with Courtney Love. Then we'll tell him if he doesn't join us, we'll put them on the Internet.	[]
Other	11	0	How do we get pictures of him naked with Courtney Love?	[]
Other	29	0	Simple, Toolshed. Coon slide 2?  We dress Professor Chaos up as Courtney Love, take pictures of him naked with a homeless guy, then photoshop Hindsight's face onto it.	[]
Other	12	0	Me?? Awww, come on, fellas, don't make me be Courtney Love.	[]
Other	10	1	Gotta get to work fast, people! Coon and Friends, ho!	['ho']
Other	20	0	...You want us to take naked pictures of Butters to use as blackmail? That doesn't sound very superhero-like.	[]
Other	25	0	That's because you think small, Mosquito! You have a tiny little mosquito brain, that's why you don't come up with the plan!	[]
Other	18	0	Nono, look. what's going on down in the Gulf is much more important than blackmailing another hero.	[]
Other	1	0	Agreed.	[]
Other	9	1	Oh who cares about some oil spill environment crap?!	['crap']
Other	9	0	Mosquito has a good plan, Cartman! Hear him out!	[]
Other	14	0	You don't know that I'm Cartman because my true identity is secret!	[]
Other	12	0	We all have a say in this organization, Coon! Let Mosquito talk!	[]
Other	14	0	All right, Mosquito, how do you wanna help people suffering in the Gulf crisis?	[]
Other	16	0	I think we should help raise money for the relief aid by having a bake sale.	[]
Other	3	0	A bake sale?	[]
Other	32	0	I have a recipe for lemon bars from my mom. We could wear our costumes outside the grocery store and sell lemon bars. Which would be a good deed, and help people.	[]
Other	8	1	We're superheroes, not the fucking Girl Scouts!	['fucking']
Other	15	0	Those people down there need help! Sometimes being a hero means helping in smaller ways.	[]
Other	1	0	Timmeh!	[]
Other	9	0	You think selling lemon bars is helpful to mankind?	[]
Other	8	0	More helpful than taking naked pictures of Butters.	[]
Other	10	0	Shut up, Mint-Berry Crunch! You aren't even anything!	[]
Other	12	0	And that's another thing: no more picking on Mint-Berry Crunch!	[]
Other	7	0	Oh, what are you, the boss now?!	[]
Other	18	0	No, but we are all equal! From now on, we vote! Who wants to go with my plan?	[]
Other	6	0	Sounds awesome. Let's do it.	[]
Other	4	0	To the grocery store!	[]
Other	49	0	As we walked along the road to the grocery store, my Coon sense started tingling. Something was wrong. Very wrong. I've learned to trust my Coon sense. It has always been my guide. And so I knew I must act. A coon must know when to defend itself.	[]
Other	15	0	Well, now we're back to normal.  Just like before and all forgotten? Right right?	[]
Other	2	0	Right right.	[]
Other	1	0	Right.	[]
Other	9	0	Keewwwl! So what's next for Coon and Friends?	[]
Other	72	0	Another crisis in the Gulf of Mexico as the oil company DP has once again made a huge error.  This time, the oil company has accidentally ripped a hole into another dimension.  The oil company stated that it knew a portal to another dimension was there, but didn't think drilling into it would prove problematic.  Now hundreds of creatures from another dimension are spilling out into our reality and wreaking havoc.	[]
Other	41	0	Hello, I'm Tony Hayward, CEO of DP. Tearing a hole into another dimension is a tragedy that should have never happened. And as CEO, I would like to say... We're sorry.  We're sorry.  We're sorry.  Sohr-ry.	[]
Other	18	0	Captain Hindsight! Sir! Calls for help are pouring in! You've got to get out to the Gulf!	[]
Other	10	0	I can't help anyone right now! Something came up.	[]
Other	8	0	What, sir? You know you can tell me.	[]
Other	11	0	Do you remember last week when I... got really really drunk?	[]
Other	2	0	Yes sir.	[]
Other	7	0	Look at those photos on the desk.	[]
Other	8	0	My God, is that you and... Courtney Love?	[]
Other	5	0	'Course it's Courtney Love!	[]
Other	6	0	But when did you have a-	[]
Other	40	0	I don't remember! That's just the point! I get drunk, I don't remember things! I shouldn't have drank that much, and I shouldn't have mixed alcohols! Alcohol shouldn't be legal! Oh it's maddening!	[]
Other	23	0	That doesn't matter now, sir! People are getting hurt in the Gulf and they need to know what they could've done!	[]
Other	25	0	I should have never kept that bottle of Macallan in the pantry! I should have never gotten around Courtney Love and a camera. I should-	[]
Other	2	0	Sir! SIR!	[]
Other	22	0	Creatures from another dimension continue to wreak havoc in the Gulf, and the question everyone is asking is, Where is Captain Hindsight?	[]
Other	5	0	Where are you, Captain Hindsight?	[]
Other	11	0	Where are d'you countih ninety-oh bebbly now is showmesitchcum.	[]
Other	11	0	With Captain Hindsight missing, what superheroes can save the Gulf now?	[]
Other	25	0	My fellow superheroes, I have done it. Hindsight is taken care of. And now the country can finally be made aware of Coon and Friends!	[]
Other	9	0	There's more important things to discuss right now!	[]
Other	13	0	Right, Toolshed. Now, how do we deal with these creatures from another dimension?	[]
Other	9	0	He means we need to discuss things with you!	[]
Other	2	0	Okay, what?	[]
Other	11	0	Aw, I don't wanna tell him. TupperWear, you tell him!	[]
Other	7	0	I don't wanna tell him either.	[]
Other	18	0	I'll tell him. Coon, I'm sorry, but we're kicking you out of Coon and Friends.	[]
Other	9	0	You're kicking me out of Coon and Friends.	[]
Other	6	0	We all voted, it was unanimous.	[]
Other	15	1	You can't kick me out of Coon and Friends, I'm the fucking Coon!	['fucking']
Other	23	0	Look, we just believe that you have your goals and ways of doing things and they conflict with what we want to accomplish.	[]
Other	9	0	But we get the headquarters and all the equipment.	[]
Other	18	0	You don't keep anything! This is my basement and I'll tell my mom on you guys!	[]
Other	9	0	We've already discussed this with her. Mrs. Cartman?	[]
Other	2	0	Yes, Mysterion?	[]
Other	9	0	Please escort the Coon out of our secret base.	[]
Other	13	0	Eric, I talked to you about beating up your friends, didn't I?	[]
Other	9	2	Mom, what the fuck?! The fuck are you doing?!	['fuck', 'fuck']
Other	35	0	Eric, you do not beat up your friends! And I told you I've had it with your language!  Your punishment is that your friends will just play superheroes without you! Go to your room!	[]
Other	7	1	You've gotta be fucking kidding me!	['fucking']
Other	10	0	Oh dear, we have certainly pooped our trousers this time!	[]
Other	21	0	Yes, I'm afraid it's going to take more than another I'm sorry campaign to please everyone this time.	[]
Other	8	0	Oh, what a right pickle we're in.	[]
Other	26	0	There is no way to cut the dimensional portal, I'm afraid. The ocean currents and swells are simply too much to get any machines in.	[]
Other	17	0	Wait a tick!  Currents and swells, that's it! I think I know how to fix this!	[]
Other	3	0	How, by Jove?	[]
Other	2	0	We drill.	[]
Other	7	0	Drill of course, yes, yes, of course.	[]
Other	23	0	I believe that if we drill on the moon, changing its gravitational pull on our ocean swells, we could cut the dimensional spill.	[]
Other	6	0	I don't quite get it.	[]
Other	16	0	We got into this mess by drilling heuh , and heuh . Now, we need to drill heuh!	[]
Other	4	0	That looks extremely promising!	[]
Other	17	0	Our environment should stabilize if it's getting drilled here, here, and here at the same time.	[]
Other	14	0	The seismic forces will be massive. Do you think the moon can take it?	[]
Other	5	0	Oh, she'll take it.	[]
Other	17	0	The DP Oil Company today drilled into the moon and appears to have caused even greater problems.	[]
Stan	15	0	Uh oh, I have a feeling we'd better get into our costumes again, guys.	[]
Other	63	0	Tom, the DP Oil Company has had another drilling accident.  This time they appear to have unleashed the dark and mighty Cthulhu.  The rise of Cthulhu from another dimension brings about three thousand years of darkness, Tom, where we will all be driven to madness and made to service Cthulhu's cult as slaves. The president of DP Oil released this press statement:	[]
Other	17	0	As president of DP Oil, I want to say... We're sorry.  I'm deeply sorry.  Sorry.	[]
Other	14	0	Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn. Praise the dark Cthulhu, long may he reign.	[]
Stan	12	0	It's up to us, guys. Let's get to the Gulf!	[]
Cartman	24	0	Darkness has taken over our town. The Coon and Friends have given in to evil. It's up to the Coon to stop them.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Asshoooles!	[]
