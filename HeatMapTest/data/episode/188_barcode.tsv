Kyle	6	0	I know! I was lying then!	[]
Cartman	32	0	Or are you lying now? So many lies, Kyle, you can't even keep them straight. You just couldn't stand that we were living in paradise while you were back home.	[]
Kyle	47	0	This isn't paradise and you know it! The people here are starving and dying! The whole world has used Somalia as a dumping ground for toxic waste. Even the fish here are radioactive!  Cartman, just give me my brother  and let us get out of here!	[]

Ike	1	0	Piewets!	[]
Other	17	0	But that's not what I do not understand. Why would anyone want to be a pirate?	[]
Butters	1	0	Huh?	[]
Other	98	0	Every day I dream that I can go to school. Learn about the world. But my mother, she is dyin' of AIDS, and there is no money for medicine. My father was killed trying to find food for us. Do you know how I feel every time we try to capture a boat? Scared. And not just scared because I might get killed, but scared because if I don't get something out of it, my family and friends are going to die. I don't want to be a pirate. I don't see how anybody would.	[]

Cartman	1	0	What?!	[]
Butters	82	0	Me and Ike, well, we've been talkin' and, well guys, we really had it pretty good back in America. I mean, sure, it's easy to think our lives are boring and full of rules, but a lot of people have it way worse. The pirate's life isn't a life of fun and adventure, it's a life of hardship and suffering. When you get down to it, well we were pretty lucky to have the lives we did.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Clyde!	[]
Clyde	9	0	I hate it here and I wanna go home!!	[]
Cartman	36	0	You guys cannot leave the pirate club now! How can you not want to stay in this paradise we've created?! In Somalia, people have no laws! They have no rules! And they never grow old!	[]
Kyle	11	0	They never grow old because they die before they're 30!	[]
Cartman	34	0	Nobody's goin' anywhere!! I'm the captain of this outfit!  To arms!  Now, is there any question who's in charge? I have an enire pirate crew willing to do anything for me!	[]
