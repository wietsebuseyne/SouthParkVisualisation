Other	5	0	Everybody's checking us out.	[]
Other	7	0	Yeah, they think we're pretty cool.	[]
Other	9	0	Hooo! We were definitely turnin' some heads out there.	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Other	14	0	I was pullin' back on that throttle, and everybody was like, What is that?	[]
Other	2	0	Fer sure!	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Other	10	0	Hey- hey, nobody here is really paying attention to us.	[]
Other	8	0	That's weird.  Oh yeah, that's better.	[]
Other	6	0	All right let's head out.	[]
Cartman	17	2	Excuse me. Excuse me! Hey assholes!  You guys know that everyone thinks you're total fags, right.	['assholes', 'fags']
Other	4	0	...What did you say?	[]
Cartman	36	1	You know, when people like you drive down the street with your unnecessarily loud motorcycles thinking you're all cool. Everyone is actually laughing at you and calling you pathetic faggots. You do realize this, right?	['faggots']
Other	22	0	...Hey man, we roll how we roll, and if people are annoyed or intimidated by it, that's too bad for them!	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Cartman	46	2	No no, no, nobody is intimidated, actually. Everyone realizes that people who are so needy for attention they need to dress up and be as loud as possible are you guys and sixteen-year-old girls! Just wanted to let you know, you're fuckin' fags.	['fuckin', 'fags']
Other	8	1	Thah- that little boy just called us fags.	['fags']
Other	8	0	Like he didn't think we were cool.	[]
Other	13	1	But he's wrong. People don't think we're fags, do they?	['fags']
Other	20	0	'Course he's wrong! And anyway, nobody except that little freak would ever say something like it to our faces!	[]
Other	10	0	Yeah! Let's ride!  Let's go! Rev 'em up!	[]
Ike	1	1	Fags!	['fags']
Other	6	0	Did that kid just call us-?	[]
Other	11	2	Ju-just ignore him!  God damn it, this is fucked up!	['damn', 'fucked']
Other	6	0	What's wrong with kids today?	[]
Other	11	1	It doesn't make any sense. They all called us fags.	['fags']
Other	11	1	How can they call us fags? I mean, listen to this?	['fags']
Other	15	0	I know, I know! Look, guys, I think I know what the problem is here.	[]
Other	3	0	Really? You do?	[]
Other	1	0	Whatwhat?	[]
Other	34	0	Yeah, think about it, guys. You see all the things kids have today? I mean, with their Xboxes and surround-sound entertainment systems, kids today are surrounded by big loud stuff all the time!	[]
Other	4	0	Hey, that's right.	[]
Other	17	0	That's all it is, guys. We just need to get a little louder, that's all.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Broflovski looks for Kenny to get clear for the pass.	[]
Cartman	8	0	But Cartman isn't letting up on him.	[]
Kyle	4	1	Oh, what the hell?!	['hell']
Other	10	0	Chicken spears! Chicken spears! Chicken spears! ...Chicken spears! Chicken spears!	[]
Stan	6	2	God damn it God damn it!	['damn', 'damn']
Other	8	0	Oh yeah, now we're turnin' some heads!	[]
Other	8	1	Let's see 'em call us fags now!	['fags']
Stan	27	0	All right, thanks for coming, everyone. As you all know, the Harley problem seems to be getting worse, and nobody is willing to do anything about it.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Yes.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Agreed.	[]
Other	13	1	I have had it with those loud, annoying, f-f-f f-faggots.	['faggots']
Stan	41	1	Now, we have some ideas, and we'd love to hear your ideas, and I think together we can-  ...and I think that together we can come up with a way to get rid of these fags once and for all.	['fags']
Kyle	2	0	Sounds good.	[]
Token	3	0	Okay good, yeah.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Ni-nice, okay.	[]
Butters	9	0	What are you guys talkin' about? Harleys are neato!	[]
Cartman	1	0	What?	[]
Butters	110	2	I always thought, someday when I grow up I'm gonna get a Harley. Then people will have to notice me, and they'll have to deal with my shit for once. The open road! The wind on my face! I'll go from city to city! Rowrrowrroowwrr! Everyone lookin' at me! Who's that guy? He must be a Hoo- he must be tough! Vromvrom, vromvrom, vrooom! I'll have my girl on the back seat holdin' on to my fat belly - sure she's missin' a few teeth, but she thinks I'm coool. That's why, when I grow up, I'm gonna be a Harley rider!	['shit', 'fat']
Stan	5	0	...That makes perfect sense, Butters.	[]
Butters	2	0	It does?	[]
Stan	6	0	Yes, now get out of here.	[]
Butters	1	0	Okay.	[]
Stan	20	0	Alright, Kyle and I are gonna spray paint messages to the Harley riders; Cartman, you said you had an idea?	[]
Cartman	21	1	I think what I'm gonna do is uh, find out wherever their bikes are and uh, crap on their seats.	['crap']
Stan	4	0	Oh that's good.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Yeah, I think that'll be nice.	[]
Stan	15	0	But that's a lot of seats? How are you going to pull that off?	[]
Cartman	19	0	I think I just need uh two, maybe three buckets of KFC, extra crispy, probably ...four cartons of gravy.	[]
Stan	39	0	Clyde, can you take care of getting KFC for Cartman? Kyle and I will get the spray paint cans. If we do this right, we'll be doing the town a huge favor, so let's get to it!	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Other	6	0	Now that was a good breakfast.	[]
Other	3	0	I'm full.	[]
Other	12	0	You guys smell that? Smells like that new famous bowl at KFC	[]
Other	10	2	Ohh, OHHH! Somebody took a shit on mah fuckin' Harley!	['shit', 'fuckin']
Other	1	0	What?	[]
Other	11	1	Awwww, me too! I got shit all over my pants now!	['shit']
Other	9	1	There's a little flag stuck in the shit!	['shit']
Other	9	1	You're fags. You've gotta be kidding me!	['fags']
Other	10	1	Come on, we'll find the bastards who did this!	['bastards']
Other	5	0	This can't be happening.	[]
Stan	4	0	Really nice work, guys.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Yeah. I think maybe everything is gonna be okay now.	[]
Other	15	0	And so I said to the guy, you really think I'm paying that much?	[]
Other	4	0	Heheh, oh Jesus Christ.	[]
Other	9	0	Oh my God. I thought we were past this.	[]
Other	54	1	Students, I am here because of a very serious matter. This morning it was discovered that in several places all over town, somebody had spray-painted the words, Fags get out. Many witnesses reported seeing children with spray paint. Now, if anybody knows anything about the kids who did this, you must come forward-	['fags']
Cartman	3	0	That was us!	[]
Other	2	0	...'Scuse me?	[]
Stan	4	0	Yeah, we did that!	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Other	12	0	...Why would you write something like that and be proud of it?!	[]
Kyle	14	1	W-well, 'cause we want all of those fags to get out of town.	['fags']
Cartman	6	1	Yeah, everyone hates those fags, right?	['fags']
Other	6	0	Yeah, uh huh, I do, yep.	[]
Mr. Mackey	31	1	Now just what the heck is going on here?! This is not what we have taught you in this school! Kyle and Stan, you've always been tolerant of gay people!	['gay']
Stan	2	1	Gay people?	['gay']
Kyle	7	1	We aren't talking about gay people.	['gay']
Mr. Mackey	13	0	You just admitted to spray-painting that they should get out of town!	[]
Stan	12	1	Dude, why would we want gay people to get out of town?	['gay']
Cartman	7	2	Oh, they think we meant gay fags.	['gay', 'fags']
Kyle	21	2	Oh. Hey, that's not very nice, Mayor. Just because a person is gay doesn't mean he's a fag.	['gay', 'fag']
Other	8	0	What?! You four boys, in my office, NOW!	[]
Stan	2	1	Aw crap!	['crap']
Other	26	2	Faggot, often shortened to fag, has been used in the English language since the late sixteenth century. Its original meaning was an old or unpleasant woman.	['faggot', 'fag']
Other	7	0	That certainly don't apply to us.	[]
Other	26	2	Faggot later was defined as a bundle of sticks. And in the nineteenth century, a faggot gatherer was someone who made a meager living gathering firewood.	['faggot', 'faggot']
Other	18	1	Well they certainly ain't calling us fags 'cause we gather sticks; there's got to be more!	['fags']
Other	6	0	What's that part say there?	[]
Other	28	1	Later, the term fag was defined as any awkward bundle to be carried, and was often used as an insult to the elderly, as in calling them baggage.	['fag']
Other	14	1	Fag was used as an insult to women, then poor people, then old people?	['fag']
Other	22	1	In the early 1900s the word became a pe-jo-ra-tive term against homosexuals and transgender people in the United States.	['homosexuals']
Other	16	0	Well that word just keeps changing its meaning. What's it got to do with us?	[]
Other	26	2	We are really trying to understand this. How is it that you boys think referring to gay people as fags in today's world is acceptable?	['gay', 'fags']
Kyle	17	3	Because we're not referring to gay people! You can be gay and not be a fag.	['gay', 'gay', 'fag']
Stan	8	2	Yeah, a lot of fags aren't gay.	['fags', 'gay']
Other	13	2	I happen to be gay, boys. Do you think I'm a fag?	['gay', 'fag']
Stan	19	0	Do you ride a big loud Harley and go up and down the streets, ruining everyone's nice time?	[]
Other	1	0	No.	[]
Stan	6	1	Then you're not a fag.	['fag']
Other	11	1	So what if a guy is gay and rides a Harley?	['gay']
Cartman	13	2	Then he's a gay fag. I mean, is this really this hard?	['gay', 'fag']
Stan	4	0	I don't know.	[]
Kenny	4	1	(This is fucking ridiculous.)	['fucking']
Stan	70	0	All right, look, you're driving in your car, okay? And you're waiting to make a left at a traffic signal. The light turns yellow, should be your turn to go, but the traffic coming at you just keeps coming. And even when the light turns red, a guy in a BMW runs the red light so you can't make your left turn. What goes through your mind?	[]
Other	1	1	Fag.	['fag']
Stan	24	2	Right. But you're not thinkin' Oh, he's a homosexual, you're thinkin' Oh, he's an inconsiderate douchebag like a Harley rider.	['homosexual', 'douchebag']
Other	9	0	This, this is, making insanely good sense to me.	[]
Other	25	0	Alright, how about this: What would you call a straight man who doesn't own a Harley, but likes them and might buy one someday?	[]
Cartman	5	0	You call them bike-curious.	[]
Other	2	0	Bike-cu-	[]
Stan	14	0	Bike-curious! Don't you people keep up with today's lingo at all?!	[]
Kenny	3	1	(Jesus fucking Christ!)	['fucking']
Other	76	4	Fellow homosexuals, I believe we have an opportunity here to take a big step forward for our kind. We must acknowledge that the words fag and faggot are never going to disappear. They're simply too much fun for everyone to say. But we must realize that we are no longer the most hated people on the planet, and help the children change the meaning of the word to describe those annoying loud faggot Harley riders!	['homosexuals', 'fag', 'faggot', 'faggot']
Other	2	0	Hear hear!	[]
Other	15	2	We should all be tolerant, but not with these fucking people! They really are faggots!	['fucking', 'faggots']
Other	3	0	Yeth Jethuth yeth!	[]
Other	6	0	This is Channel 4 Evening News.	[]
Other	35	2	A new movement in South Park is bringing to question the word fag. Gay groups are pointing out that the word no longer means to kids today what it meant just a few years ago.	['fag', 'gay']
Other	7	0	And what is your name, little boy?	[]
Other	1	0	Martin.	[]
Other	42	4	Alright Martin, can you do me a favor? Could you point to the fag for me?  Point to which one is the fag.  All right now could you just point to the fag for me, little girl? Which one is a faggot?	['fag', 'fag', 'fag', 'faggot']
Other	30	2	Sparked by this realization and persuaded by a gay advocate group, the Mayor signed a new city ordinance today making the word fag officially refer to annoying inconsiderate Harley riders.	['gay', 'fag']
Other	10	1	How do you fags feel about the new city ordinance?	['fags']
Other	4	0	What did you say?	[]
Other	13	1	Just asking you if you feel okay or displeased about the ordinance, fag.	['fag']
Other	18	1	Hey you know what? If you call me fag in my face one more time, you'd better-	['fag']
Other	5	0	I already did it twice.	[]
Other	16	0	Well I think that- I think that you uh, you probably won't say it again.	[]
Other	4	0	I bet I do.	[]
Other	3	0	Well okay, I-	[]
Other	1	1	Fag.	['fag']
Other	11	0	As more people in South Park adapt to the new meaning...	[]
Randy	1	1	Fags!	['fags']
Other	10	0	...more and more Harley riders are deciding to ride elsewhere.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Oh yeah, nice, Kenny.	[]
Stan	16	0	Isn't this awesome, you guys? I haven't seen a Harley for like three days.	[]
Kyle	11	0	I know. It's like we have the outdoors back again.	[]
Other	8	2	You four turd balls in my office NOW!	['turd', 'balls']
Stan	2	1	Aw crap!	['crap']
Other	9	0	You have got me in a lot of trouble!	[]
Other	61	3	The fact of the matter is that fag is still defined in the dictionary as a pejorative term against homosexuals, and so you are still causing harm to gay people everywhere whether you mean it differently or not! The town of South Park and its mayor have once again shown themselves to be completely out of touch with the progressive world!	['fag', 'homosexuals', 'gay']
Other	15	0	She's gaining support all over the country. I should have never listened to you!	[]
Kyle	4	0	We're sorry, Mayor.	[]
Other	21	2	Oh, that's nice! You made our entire town look like gay-bashing redneck homophobes, but at least you're sorry!	['gay', 'homophobes']
Stan	4	0	We can fix this!	[]
Other	1	0	HOW?!	[]
Stan	27	2	That, that lady said it's because fag still means homosexual in the dictionary. So we just have to convince the dictionary people to change the definition.	['fag', 'homosexual']
Cartman	17	1	Hey, hey yeah. Then people would be free to call Harley riders fags all over the country.	['fags']
Other	100	5	Now I don't know about you, but I think this town is starting a trend. And if we let them officially change the meaning of fag from gay people to us, then soon every town might.  If we don't do anythng, we can end up trying to fight e-  If we don't do anything, we c-... Hey Bartlett. Bartlett!  I'm trying to talk, you fag!  Aw, see? Now they got us doin' it to ourselves! We gotta put a stop to this now!  We're going to ride into that town and kick some fuckin' ass!	['fag', 'gay', 'fag', 'fuckin', 'ass']
Other	50	2	Excitement is in the air as the citizens of South Park amass to see if the word fag will officially be changed in the English dictionary. Four local boys will state their case to the head dictionary editor, and if they succeed, fag will officially refer to Harley riders nationwide.	['fag', 'fag']
Other	9	0	You can do it, boys! We believe in you!	[]
Other	33	0	And Tom, it looks as though the dictionary officials have arrived.  Entering the scene now are the keepers of the current dictionary and of course, the dictionary's head editor, Mr. Emmanuel Lewis.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Emmanuel Lewis, huh?	[]
Stan	6	0	Ohh, it all makes sense now.	[]
Other	29	1	To change...  the definition of a word... is no trifling thing. I expect this proposal for changing the definition of the word fag to be both discerning and undisputable.	['fag']
Other	7	0	Come on boys, you can do it!	[]
Randy	10	1	Look out, it's a bunch of pissed-off faggots!	['faggots']
Stan	4	1	There's fags everywhere!	['fags']
Kyle	3	0	We gotta run!	[]
Other	9	0	WAAAH! What nefariousness is this?! Ogh! You obdurate beast!	[]
Other	9	1	Well well. Now, do you think we're fags?	['fags']
Stan	7	1	Yes. Yes, sir, you are total fags.	['fags']
Kyle	6	0	Yeah. You definitely made your point.	[]
Other	16	3	No! We rolled in, kicked ass, and took shit over! Is that what a fag does?!	['ass', 'shit', 'fag']
Stan	9	1	Yeah yeah, that's totally what a fag does.	['fag']
Other	11	1	No, you're supposed to think we're not fags now!	['fags']
Stan	13	1	But then why are you acting like such fags? I don't understand.	['fags']
Kyle	4	0	I don't either.	[]
Butters	44	0	That's because you guys never understood!  You fellers never got what these people are really about! Freedom! Rebellion against the system! A living image of independence! Solid, defiant, and supremely cool, the biker is an All-American icon of resilient individuality and freedom.	[]
Other	5	1	Who is this little fag?	['fag']
Butters	15	1	I'm not a fag yet, sirruh but a but I am bike-c-curious.	['fag']
Other	8	0	That's it, let's kill them all!	[]
Cartman	8	1	No! That'll just make you bigger fags!	['fags']
Other	18	2	No one is killing anyone!  We've had enough! You faggots get the hell out of our town!	['faggots', 'hell']
Other	23	3	All right everyone, all right. We are fags. Yeah, we're fags. We're total fags. And yo know what? We like it.	['fags', 'fags', 'fags']
Other	5	1	Yeah, we like being fags.	['fags']
Other	55	2	So go ahead, America. Whenever you pass by Harley riders like us, roll down your window, and yell Faggots! All you kids out there, when you see us, walk up to us, and say Hello, fags. No, really, we want you to. At least we're cool enough to embrace who we are. Right guys?	['faggots', 'fags']
Other	7	0	That's right. You got it. Yeah.	[]
Other	7	1	Come on, fags, let's roll out!	['fags']
Stan	13	1	...And that, Mister Editor, is why they are the true definition of fags.	['fags']
Other	16	1	Let there be no perplexity: those individuals are the legitimate faggots. The definition shall be replaced.	['faggots']
Stan	4	0	We did it! Yeah!	[]
Kyle	6	0	Yeah! We did it, you guys!	[]
Cartman	8	0	Oh it's over, it's finally over!	[]
Stan	5	0	Today, we've made history.	[]
