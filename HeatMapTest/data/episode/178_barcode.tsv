Other	5	0	What's going on, Dad?	[]
Other	9	0	Mr. Marsh you have to move! It isn't-	[]
Randy	9	0	Oh God.  I'm-  I'm so-  Startled.  ARRRGH!	[]
Craig	137	0	My name is Craig Tucker. Last week was my birthday.  My Grandma gave me a check for a hundred dollars.  I was sooo happy. But then, four kids from school came to my house  and said I should use my hundred dollars to invest in becoming a Peruvian flute band.  They promised I would double my money in one afternoon.  But the government arrested us along with all the other Peruvian flute bands and took us to an internment camp in Miami.  We begged to go home, but instead the government told us they were sending us to Peru.  And so that is now why I'm in Peru. If I die, let it be known that it is because four guys I don't even like from school lied to me and took my birthday money.	[]
Stan	10	0	We didn't lie, Craig, it was a sweet idea!	[]
Kyle	14	0	Yeah. How are we supposed to know that pan flute bands would be outlawed?	[]
Other	13	0	I don't get it. They said the military would meet us here.	[]
Other	14	0	This is where they told us to land. Can you get through to Washington?	[]
Other	3	0	I'm trying.	[]
Other	5	0	This is Connor in Washington.	[]
Other	32	0	Hey, Connor, the place that Homeland Security told us to start the operation, there, there's nobody here to meet us. It's like they sent us to no man's land.	[]
Other	4	0	Jesus they're everywhere!	[]
Other	3	0	What are everywhere?	[]
Other	16	0	...so furry! They're attacking... every city... ha- people dying... Ha-... guinea pigs... all over! Agh.	[]
Stan	2	0	Guinea pigs?	[]
Other	27	0	Can't stop them! Need to get... out... ergh. I just ate... a peanut... Agh peanut now stuck... in throat... Urgh shouldn't eat peanut... when scared.	[]
Randy	59	0	I've got the video camera. Got it turned on again.  Okay. This is... Randy Marsh... I'm shooting this video of myself. Twenty minutes ago some... huge creatures attacked our town... Still chaos out the window...  I barely made it back to the house. Sharon is here with me,  and there's Shelly.  Wave to the camera, Shelly.	[]
Other	15	0	Randy, will you put down that camera? We need to figure out what to do.	[]
Randy	11	0	I don't know what to do. I'm so startled.	[]
Other	9	0	We have to see what the news is saying.	[]
Other	16	0	This is a shot of New York City where the... giant guinea pigs have also attacked.	[]
Other	2	0	Guinea pigs?	[]
Other	13	0	Reports of attacks are coming in from major cities all over the world.	[]
Randy	5	0	Jesus, this thing is worldwide?	[]
Other	10	0	Look at that thing! Randy, what are we gonna do?	[]
Randy	9	0	Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my Gohhhd!	[]
Other	3	0	Go Randy, run!	[]
Randy	3	0	Gotta get out!	[]
Other	20	0	Michaels, Harrison, anybody?  Nothing. LSAT is down and no answer at RCU. Whatever is going on out there is huge.	[]
Stan	65	0	Ah all right, just let me get this straight: the head of Homeland Security ordered you to fly us, five kids, to Peru, but had you land way up in the Andes Mountains of Peru so that other government people could meet us and then... somehow tell us how to go to the capital of Peru, way over in Lima, and take down their government.	[]
Other	5	0	...Yes, that was the order.	[]
Kyle	6	0	And that makes sense to you?	[]
Other	4	0	Nope, not at all.	[]
Other	19	0	Actually, the whole rounding up of the pan flute bands didn't make sense to any of us either.	[]
Stan	18	0	None of what that Homeland Security guy does make sense, so could you just fly us home, please?!	[]
Other	24	0	You don't understand, the plan was to have a refueling truck meet us here. We don't have enough gas to fly anyplace.	[]
Craig	4	0	Oh, that's awesome.	[]
Kyle	10	0	So we've gotta find another way out of here.	[]
Other	8	0	It's starting to look that way, yeah.	[]
Craig	19	0	This is fun. Let's walk for miles through a spooky jungle. It just keeps getting better and better.	[]
Cartman	12	0	You know what, we're getting pretty sick of your attitude, Craig.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Yeah!)	[]
Cartman	11	0	Nobody likes hanging out with people who complain all the time.	[]
Other	19	0	Luck at that: no lights on, nothing. It's like, humans have never been to this part of Peru.	[]
Other	27	0	More guinea pigs seem to be moving in from all directions. We checked on Wikipedia and found out that guinea pigs are from the Andes Mountains, here.	[]
Other	14	0	What about the pan flute bands? Are they on their way to Guantanamo Bay?	[]
Other	13	0	...Sir, we believe we have bigger problems right now than pan flute bands.	[]
Other	9	0	Have they been loaded onto the boats or not?!	[]
Other	19	0	No sir. We diverted all the resources away from the pan flute bands to deal with the guinea pigs.	[]
Other	35	0	That was an order!  The pan flute bands were to be put on boats to Guantanamo last night!  I am still in charge here! I want those pan flute bands on the boats to Guantanamo!	[]
Other	13	0	Yes sir. I don't see why you have to yell at people.	[]
Randy	16	0	Hey we're down in... Main Street now and...  Wah? Oh, ohh, look at that.  Ohhh!	[]
Other	5	0	Where do we go, Randy?	[]
Randy	12	0	We've got to get out of town. Go through that way.	[]
Other	5	0	Geow, my arm! MY ARM!	[]
Randy	2	0	Oh Jesus!	[]
Other	2	0	Randy, run!	[]
Randy	16	0	Okay. We're running now.  There's Sharon and Shelly running. Wave to the camera, Shelly!	[]
Other	1	0	Dad!	[]
Randy	16	0	In there, in there!  Oh God, oh God I'm so startled. Are you startled, Sharon?	[]
Other	5	0	Randy, put down that c-!	[]
Other	5	0	It's gonna kill us!	[]
Other	10	0	Just stay down, Shelly. It can't come in here.	[]
Randy	14	0	Hold on, hold on, I need to get a shot of it from outside.	[]
Other	5	0	Randy? Where are you going?	[]
Randy	9	0	Here we see a view from outside the bus.	[]
Other	7	1	Randy!  What the hell are you doing?	['hell']
Randy	9	0	I got a... really good shot of it, Sharon.	[]
Other	17	0	I don't know, Lemsky. This entire area of Peru isn't even charted on the maps.	[]
Other	25	0	This whole valley is strange. Just look at the size of that fruit.  Ain't that a peach? And how do you like them apples?	[]
Other	10	0	Take a look at this! They look like... beehive combs.	[]
Other	3	0	Oh my God.	[]
Stan	5	0	Dude, what is this place?	[]
Other	13	0	It's like... an unknown valley that time forgot, where everything grows huge.	[]
Craig	22	0	That's a shock. I decided to follow you guys, and now I'm in the land of the giants lost world.	[]
Stan	26	0	Craig, it isn't our fault! You make it sound like we always wanna be in situations like this but we don't have any choice!	[]
Kyle	4	0	Yeah. Stuff just happens.	[]
Craig	3	0	Stuff just happens.	[]
Kyle	3	0	That's right!	[]
Craig	28	0	You just wind up being sent by the government to take down the city of Lima only to wind up in the land of the giants lost world.	[]
Cartman	3	0	That's right.	[]
Craig	28	0	You know when stuff happens to most kids? They fall off their bikes. They get in fights with their parents. They get swindled out of their birthday money.	[]
Other	11	0	Look, wherever we are, I think we'd better keep moving.	[]
Kenny	3	0	(Hey, look out!)	[]
Other	6	0	Ohhh stop it, make it stohhhp!	[]
Randy	43	0	All right, all right. Here's Sharon and Shelly on the roof of Best Buy. We, we run up here to get off the streets. We found the Stotch family hiding up here also. There's Chris and Linda, and their son Butters.	[]
Butters	2	0	Hello, heh.	[]
Other	7	0	What is that? Chris, what is that?	[]
Randy	11	0	That's a that's a, that's a new sound.	[]
Other	3	0	Oh God look!	[]
Other	5	0	Those aren't guinea pigs.	[]
Other	4	0	Get off the roof!	[]
Randy	19	0	Go! Go go go go go!  Oho, Oh God, we're going down the stairs now. Okay, getting downstairs.	[]
Other	21	0	And we are now getting word of giant bees. The giant bees have been seen in the U.S. and Europe.	[]
Randy	4	0	Oh no! Oho oho.	[]
Other	12	0	Get away, there's bees everywhere!  There's another one right there!	[]
Other	6	0	It stung me! It stung me!	[]
Randy	8	0	Whoa, that startled me! That was really startling!	[]
Kyle	11	0	Um I think we're just heading deeper into the mountains.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Yeah, maybe we should start heading that way.	[]
Kenny	5	1	(I think we're fucked!)	['fucked']
Kyle	5	0	Hey, hey, look at this.	[]
Cartman	3	0	What is it?	[]
Kyle	7	0	I don't know. It's old.	[]
Stan	7	0	Let's see what's in there.	[]
Craig	34	0	Let's see what's in there. That's why you guys get into these situations. Because when you come across a spooky, ancient ruin, you say Let's see what's in there.	[]
Stan	7	0	It might be a way out, Craig!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Yeah, Mr. Complainy Pants!	[]
Kyle	12	0	Whoa, I don't think anyone's been in here for centuries	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Yeah. Totally.)	[]
Stan	12	0	You guys, look at this.  It's a wall of ancient drawings.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Dude, it's a Peruvian flute band.	[]
Stan	5	0	I know, a-and look.	[]
Cartman	12	0	Looks like the... pan flute music is driving away giant... guinea pigs?	[]
Kyle	16	0	Oh no way! Look!  The pan flute band's put in prison, just like what happened.	[]
Stan	9	0	And then the guinea pigs killing people.  And then...	[]
Cartman	4	0	Dude, it's Craig!	[]
Craig	1	0	What?	[]
Kyle	3	0	That is Craig.	[]
Stan	6	0	Dude, Craig, what's goin' on?	[]
Craig	4	0	I have no idea.	[]
Cartman	16	0	Well do you mind tellin' us what you're doing on an ancient Incan wall, Craig?	[]
Craig	4	0	I don't know.	[]
Other	30	0	There is now word of huge beehives forming in cities across the U.S. and Canada. Europe and China are reporting deaths by guinea pigs in the tens of thousands.	[]
Other	10	0	And how are the efforts to contain all this going?	[]
Other	18	0	It's bad, sir. It seems we have no way of stopping it; we've lost complete control.	[]
Other	2	0	Uh, sir?	[]
Other	11	0	Ah I'm sorry, I just thought of a funny joke.	[]
Other	3	0	Oh, a-hah.	[]
Other	13	0	All right, get the jets ready. I need to get to Machu Picchu.	[]
Other	4	0	Uh, Machu Picchu, sir?	[]
Other	14	0	Yes, I need to be taken to Machu Picchu! Have you lost your hearing?!	[]
Other	13	0	But S-sir, what could possibly be at Machu Picchu to help the-	[]
Other	6	0	Am I in charge or not?!	[]
Randy	13	0	We're in the  grocery store now. Some of the survivors here uh.	[]
Other	7	0	Can we get out through the highway?	[]
Other	11	0	The highway is unreachable; there's guinea rats all over it.	[]
Mr. Garrison	2	0	Guinea rats?	[]
Randy	4	0	I'm so startled.	[]
Mr. Garrison	6	0	What do you mean guinea rats?	[]
Other	22	0	Look, there are guinea pigs, but there's also guinea bees, guinea rats. I've even seen some guinea spiders out there.	[]
Other	6	0	Randy, will you stop doing that?!	[]
Other	14	0	Look, I I need we need to find a way out under the city.	[]
Mr. Garrison	9	0	In the sewers? Can't be safe down there.	[]
Randy	7	0	Oh God, what are we gonna dooo?	[]
Other	3	0	Oh my God!	[]
Other	5	0	Something's inside the store!	[]
Other	5	0	Guinea rabbits! They're inside!	[]
Other	4	0	God they're everywhere!	[]
Other	4	0	Help me!  Help... me...	[]
Other	2	0	Travis! No!	[]
Randy	5	0	You can't help him!	[]
Other	5	0	There's something over there!	[]
Other	5	0	It's a guinea bear!	[]
Randy	7	0	No, it's a guinea mouse, stupid!	[]
Other	2	0	Kill me!	[]
Other	10	0	Randy, the storeroom, we've gotta get to the storeroom!	[]
Other	5	0	Mom, I can't see.	[]

Other	4	0	What what what what?	[]
Randy	7	0	Nothing, sorry. I just startled myself. Gaaah!	[]
Stan	7	0	Let's head over this way, guys.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Hear that? It sounds like water.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Yeah, it's coming from up there.	[]
Stan	1	0	Wow.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Dude, that's awesome.	[]
Stan	5	0	All right, let's go.	[]
Craig	1	0	No.	[]
Stan	4	0	Wait, whattaya mean no?	[]
Craig	8	0	I'm not following you guys any more.	[]
Stan	9	0	Dude, we we have to go check this out.	[]
Craig	1	0	Why?	[]
Stan	10	0	'Cause just, that, that's just the way it is.	[]
Craig	25	0	Every time bad things happen, you guys end up putting yourselves deeper into the middle of it, because that's just the way it is.	[]
Stan	13	1	Hey, we aren't the ones on an ancient temple prophecy wall, buttwipe!	['buttwipe']
Craig	22	0	I don't care. I've decided that I'm done. I am choosing not to be a part of this anymore.	[]
Kyle	5	0	How do you do that?	[]
Craig	4	0	It's easy. Watch.	[]
Stan	4	0	Craig, dude, wait up.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Dude, Craig, we should go back now.	[]
Craig	1	0	No.	[]
Stan	6	0	Hey look, there's something here.	[]
Craig	1	0	...Nope.	[]
Cartman	12	0	Dude, this is boring. This is just a bunch of walking around.	[]
Craig	10	0	Yup, nice and boring. Just the way I like it.	[]
Randy	42	0	It's been three days now since the guinea pigs and the guinea bees attacked. Guinea rabbits are still everywhere, along with a few guinea panthers. We've taken shelter at the Outback Steakhouse. There's Sharon and Shelly. Say hey guys.	[]
Other	6	0	What is that? What is that?	[]
Randy	10	0	I'm gon-, I'm gonna take a look outside!	[]
Randy	3	0	What is it?	[]
Other	5	0	It's a Guineasaurus Rex!	[]
Other	3	0	Oh my Gohhhd!	[]
Randy	7	0	Oh no, I'm way too startled!	[]
Other	1	0	Look!	[]
Randy	55	0	Jesus, they can't kill it!  What do you think about the Guineasaurus Rex, Shelly?  Oh that's good. There, there's Shelly with the Guineasaurus Rex in the background. Give, give a little peace sign, Shelly.  Oh I know, hold out your palm so it looks like you're holding the Guineasaurus Rex. Shelly?	[]
Other	13	1	Randy?! I have had it! You are putting down that God damned camera!	['damned']
Randy	16	0	Sharon, you're gonna be really glad we have all this footage of the family someday.	[]
Other	20	0	Wait here a minute.  Behold! I am standing on your precious land! I've waited a long time for this!	[]
Other	4	0	What's he doing?	[]
Other	16	0	What of your prophecy now?! Nothing can stop me!  Craiiig!  No! How did you get here?!	[]
Cartman	17	1	Hey, it's that asshole who sent us to the jungle with nobody to pick us up!	['asshole']
Other	6	0	Sir, ih-is everything all right?	[]
Other	2	0	Shoot them!	[]
Other	2	0	Shoot them?	[]
Other	12	0	They're a Peruvian band that escaped. We must keep them contained.	[]
Stan	33	0	No no, listen to me. The Peruvian flute bands were keeping the guinea creatures away. Whatever is happening to the world is happening because you guys got rid of all the flute bands.	[]
Other	4	0	I said shoot them!	[]
Kyle	9	0	Go look! It's all an ancient Incan prophecy.	[]
Other	7	0	Maybe we should look at it, sir.	[]
Other	11	1	Damn you Craiiig! You just don't ever stop, do you?!	['damn']
Craig	5	0	I didn't say anything.	[]
Other	86	0	You see, for thousands of years horrid creatures have lived in the Guinea Valley of Peru. The Incas learned how to keep the creatures at bay: by playing pan flute music. Guinea creatures hate it even more than humans do. But the prophecy foretold that one day the creatures would be unleashed and I have made that happen! The Incas predicted the world would be saved... by Craig. But that part of the prophecy will not come true! For you will all die on this mountain!	[]
Other	8	0	You're, you're some kind of monster.	[]
Other	20	0	Oh, I'm much more than that. Guinea bees, guinea rabbits, guineasaurus rexes, I am something much more evil!  Arrrgh.	[]
Other	2	0	Guinea pirate!	[]
Stan	2	0	Jesus Christ!	[]
Craig	18	0	Sir, I promise you, I'm not going to ruin your plans. I'll just walk away. See?	[]
Other	2	0	Dargh, no!	[]
Craig	10	0	Okay, now there's sparks shooting out of my eyes.	[]
Other	6	0	Argh, curse ye, Craig. Dar, argh.	[]
Craig	58	0	My name is Craig Tucker. Last week I stopped a guinea pirate from taking over the earth. All the Peruvian flute bands were released,  and drove the guinea creatures back to the Andes mountains.  Many people had died, but mankind had prevailed.  All over the world, survivors were found, living witnesses to the horror that had been seen.	[]
Randy	16	0	Here here, look, look!  What the?  Oh- ohhh I didn't have a tape in it.	[]
Craig	95	0	The guinea pirate lived, but was taken to prison to live out the rest of his days.  And people all over the world learned to support their local Peruvian flute bands, and buy their CDs. For they protect us from the guinea creatures. As for me, I was returned home by Homeland Security.  My parents were sooo happy.  I realized that we don't always have control over what happens to us.  We are but players on the stage of life. And I also learned to never listen when people come asking you for money.	[]
Cartman	5	1	That guy's an asshole!	['asshole']
Kyle	4	1	Yeah, what a dick!	['dick']
Kenny	4	1	(I fuckin' hate Craig!)	['fuckin']
Other	6	0	Sir! Sir, we have a problem!	[]
Other	2	0	What now?!	[]
Other	24	0	The former director of Homeland Security, that turned out to be a guinea pig? It attacked the guards, got out of its holding cell.	[]
Other	6	0	My God, are you telling me..?	[]
Other	7	0	Yes sir. It broke out of prison.	[]
