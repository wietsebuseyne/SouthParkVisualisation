Other	19	0	I swear, if you don't have that thing workin' in three minutes this whole planet is done for!	[]
Stan	11	0	Dad, it's over. We have to tell everyone we cheated.	[]
Randy	15	0	No. I've got it all figured out, son. You have to kill the alien.	[]
Stan	3	0	Kill the alien?	[]

Randy	19	0	Well I mean...  this is a lot of space cash, guys. Think o'what we could do with it.	[]
Stan	2	0	No, Dad-	[]
Mr. Garrison	12	0	He's right. We don't have to call the police back.	[]
Other	10	0	All right, let's get the cash put into boxes!	[]
Stan	6	0	Whoawhoawhoa Dad, what are we doing?	[]
Randy	4	0	Will you relax, Stan?	[]
Other	13	0	Don't think you can keep the all the space cash for yourself!	[]
Other	17	0	That's right! This is all of our planet; the space cash belongs to all of us!	[]
Other	19	0	Either America shares that space cash with the rest of the world or we will tell the space cops!	[]
Randy	20	0	Alright, fine, look: there's plenty of space cash to go around!  Thanks to us, our planet is rich, son!	[]
Randy	45	2	Oh no, China, we get to keep the ship. Because we killed the alien, you boner! Oh-oh come on England, you got just as much of the space cash as everyone else!  Oh crap it's the cops! Hang on.  Ah hey, space officers.	['boner', 'crap']

Other	4	0	No we haven't-	[]
Other	3	0	No space cash.	[]
Other	1	0	No.	[]
Randy	12	0	Yeah, it doesn't look like the space cash was ever here.	[]
Other	13	0	Uh huh. Guess he must have dropped it off at some other planet.	[]
Randy	1	0	Probably.	[]
Other	45	0	Well you folks all take care now.  Just... one more thing, Earthlings, uh... We had some images done of your planet and it appears that one of your poorer countries - Mexico? - has built 32 new hospitals and seven water parks in the last four days.	[]
Randy	29	0	Oh... Yeah, Mexico. You know oh, oh, yeah. All of us other countries chipped in and uh, gave Mexico some aid. Yeah they really needed... some new water parks.	[]
Other	6	0	Uh huh. Have a good day.	[]
Randy	32	1	Hey. Hey Mexico! We said no spending the space cash yet!  What the hell are you doing?! Will some country that speaks Spanish yell at Mexico please? They're gonna ruin everything!	['hell']
Randy	22	0	No, Japan! Will you listen to me for five seconds?! If you keep building giant robots the cops are gonna ask questions!	[]
Other	10	0	Well then why can Engrand build a nuclear power plant?!	[]
Randy	4	0	Nobody can build anything!!	[]
Other	19	0	Yeah, well, it's not even gonna matter, because Finland is thinking about telling the space cops the truth!	[]
Randy	2	0	Wha?! Finland?!	[]
Other	22	0	We believe the aliens are going to find out sooner or later what we did. It's best we come clean now.	[]
Randy	11	0	Will you just relax, Finland?! Nobody is gonna find out anything.	[]
Other	15	0	I'm sorry, but our nation is resolved. We cannot live with the guilt anymore.	[]
Randy	26	0	Okay okay!  You're right. You're right, Finland! Okay? You're right. Can you just... let us other countries talk pr-private, for a moment?	[]
Other	2	0	Very well.	[]
Randy	11	0	All right you guys, we've gotta get rid of Finland.	[]
Other	9	0	Yep, we gotta take out Finrand, they gonna squeal.	[]
Other	7	0	Yeah, I think we all agree. Guys?	[]
Randy	2	1	Oh dammit!	['dammit']
Randy	9	0	Uh hey, space officers. How can we help you?	[]
Other	13	0	Well we're a little puzzled over one of your countries? Uh, Finland?	[]
Randy	5	0	Whaa-wha-what about it	[]
Other	6	0	It appears to have been... destroyed.	[]
Randy	6	0	Whaaat? Oh my God, not Finland.	[]
Other	4	0	Oh no, not Finland.	[]
Randy	5	0	Hey guys, Finland's dead.	[]
Other	4	0	Oh no. No! Nooo.	[]
Other	4	0	Noo, not a Finrand!	[]
Other	4	0	All of Finland, gone.	[]
Randy	12	0	Yeah, somebody better break the news to Norway; they were really close.	[]
Other	9	0	None of you knew anything about Finland's destruction?	[]
Randy	11	0	No, I mean... Odds are, they nuked themselves. You know, suicide.	[]
Other	7	0	We didn't say anything about nukes.	[]
Randy	8	0	Or, or whatever they did, I'm sayin'.	[]
Stan	19	0	'Scuse me! 'Scuse me!  Everyone, I have an announcement to make. I'm giving back my Pinewood Derby trophy!	[]
Other	1	0	What?	[]
Randy	1	0	Stan?	[]
Stan	25	0	The truth is, I don't deserve this trophy. 'Cause I cheated on my Pinewood Derby car. I used something not in the approved kit.	[]
Other	5	0	Not in the approved kit?!	[]
Other	6	0	He cheated on the Pinewood Derby?	[]
Stan	37	0	This trophy isn't mine, and so I have to give it back! Because if I'm not honest now, then I'll have to keep this lie going forever. And it will just grow and grow.	[]
Randy	25	0	Well Stan, we're proud of you for coming clean. But it doesn't change the fact that you cheated. Go to your room, son.	[]
Other	19	0	Your son seems to have some pretty inspirational words. You sure you Earthlings have nothing else to tell us?	[]
Randy	12	0	Hey uh, do we have anything else to tell the space cops?	[]
Other	1	0	Nope.	[]
Other	1	0	Nope.	[]
Other	2	0	No changes.	[]
Other	1	0	Nope.	[]
Other	2	0	No changes.	[]
Other	1	0	Nope.	[]
Other	4	0	No. Tell them no.	[]
Other	2	0	No changes.	[]
Randy	7	0	Yeah, no, we've told you everything.	[]
Other	15	0	All right, that's it then. Come on out sir, it appears to be over.	[]
Randy	8	1	Aw shit, it's Baby Fark McGee-zax!	['shit']
Other	14	0	My real name is Kevern Zaksor. I am the ambassador to new planet testing.	[]
Other	7	1	What the hell are they talking about?	['hell']
Other	38	0	These are not space cops.  There is no space jail, and space cash is only worth what you as a planet decided it was worth. I mean, how stupid is your species? Space jail? Baby Fark McGee-zax?	[]
Randy	4	0	It was... a trick?	[]
Other	33	0	Whenever a civilization discovers warp speed, we want to bring them into the Federation of Planets, but first we do the space cash test, to see if that species is worthy of joining.	[]
Other	36	0	Needless to say, you all failed.  People of earth, since you did not return the space cash, your species and your planet is hereby forever blocked off and barred from the rest of the universe. Goodbye.	[]
Randy	6	0	No heywaitwait, no!  Well that sucks!	[]
