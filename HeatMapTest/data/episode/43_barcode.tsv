Say boys, what do you think of KOZY-FM's Halloween Haunt so far?	[]
Stan	33	1	This one time, like eight months ago, I saw two guys kissing in a park. And that was the gayest thing I'd ever seen, until I saw the KOZY-FM Halloween Haunt.	['gayest']
Other	9	0	Uh-hall right! Well, enjoy the spooky docks, kids.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Hey you guys!  You know what time of year it is?	[]
Kyle	6	0	Of course, dumbass, it's Halloween.	[]
Cartman	22	0	That's right, and that means only two more months till Christmas! You'd better watch out, you'd better not cry-	[]
Stan	1	0	Christmas?	[]
Cartman	5	0	-Christmastime is presents for me.	[]
Other	17	2	Aw, nuts! Come on, Ned, this ain't no whore house, it's a hor-ROR house.	['nuts', 'whore']
Other	1	0	Awwww!	[]
Cartman	5	0	Eeyyy , Spooky Laboratory, you guys.	[]
Kyle	21	0	Those things are stupid, Cartman. They just stick your hand in cold spaghetti and tell you it's intestines and stuff.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Well, I'm going to Spooky Laboratory!  Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells...	[]
Other	17	0	Welcome to Spooky Laboratory.  I'm your guide, Dr. Spookalot. Allow me to show around the lab.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Cool!	[]
Other	8	1	Here I have a bowl of human eyeballs.	['eyeballs']
Cartman	2	0	Ewww-hoohooo.	[]
Other	7	0	And here you can feel the brains.	[]
Cartman	3	1	Oh-HO, grohoss.	['ho']
Other	11	0	And here you can feel the warm innards of the body	[]
Cartman	13	0	Eewww, it feels like cold spaghetti! You guys, it feels like cold spaghetti!	[]
Kenny	11	0	(You guys, I'm gonna try and win that costume contest!)	[]
Kyle	16	0	Give it up, Kenny! You're not gonna win that costume contest! Your costumes always suck.	[]
Other	1	0	BOO!	[]
Other	1	0	Aaaaah!	[]
Other	9	0	Ha ha ha ha ha! We scared you, chickens!	[]
Stan	5	0	W-we weren't scared!	[]
Other	13	0	Oh no? Well, you should be!  The pirate ghosts are gonna come getcha!	[]
Kyle	2	0	The what?	[]
Other	21	0	Didn't you know? There's an old legend in South Park that says these docks are haunted by pirate ghosts.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Nuh-uh.	[]
Other	18	0	Yuh-huh. They roam these docks with their swords and hook-hands  looking for victims tuh...  cut up!	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Hoh!)	[]
Stan	6	0	That's just an old legend.	[]

Cartman	11	0	You guys, my hand totally smells like spaghetti now. Smell it.	[]
Stan	22	0	I'm sick of those fifth graders scaring us all the time! We should come up with a way to scare them!	[]
Kyle	8	0	Yeah! Let's see how they like it!	[]
Other	24	0	Joining me now is Father Maxi, from the South Park Church. Father, what do you think of all the preparations here at the docks?	[]
Other	12	0	Halloween is an abomination of God! A celebration of the occult-eh!	[]
Other	13	0	Yeah, and how about KoRn playing the big concert tomorrow? Pretty exciting, huh?	[]
Other	32	0	KoRn is a devil-worshiping group that plays violent music! If we allow that demon band to play on this most unholy of holidays, we may incur the full wrath of evil!	[]
Other	19	0	Alriight, we'll see you tomorrow for Halloween! In the meantime  here's a KOZY hit by Barry Manilow.	[]
Stan	19	0	Come on, you guys, think! How can we scare the fifth graders? It has to be something reeaally scary.	[]
Cartman	25	0	We could get a big scary plastic spider, and dangle it in front of them on a string... s- spooky spider, that's pretty scary.	[]
Kyle	5	0	That's not scary, fatass!	[]
Stan	13	0	Well, come on! We can think of something better than stupid pirate ghosts!	[]
Other	1	0	Darrrr!	[]
Other	9	0	Are you sure we're goin' the right way?	[]
Other	11	0	I don't know. This map doesn't make any sense.	[]
Other	10	0	That's because you've got it upside down, chowderhead!	[]
Other	1	0	Oops.	[]
Other	11	0	When are we gonna get to the gig? I'm starving.	[]
Other	26	0	Don't think about it. We'll just keep playing our game. Ready? I spy with my little eye something that begins with the letter T!	[]
Other	5	0	I know! A t-ree!	[]
Other	17	0	You've got it. I spy with my little eye something that begins with the letter R.	[]
Other	2	0	A road?	[]
Other	3	0	That's it!	[]
Other	1	0	Darrrr!	[]
Other	17	0	Okay, here's one. I spy with my little eye something that begins with the letter P.	[]
Other	3	0	The letter P?	[]
Other	8	0	What the heck starts with the letter P?	[]
Other	3	0	Puh-pirate ghosts!	[]
Other	1	0	Aaaaah!	[]

Other	6	0	Eric, your little friends are here.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Mom, mom! You wanna see what I want for Christmas?	[]
Other	6	0	E-heric, it's only Halloween.	[]
Cartman	9	0	That's only 72 shopping days left for you!	[]
Stan	7	0	Come on, fatass, we have to go!	[]
Cartman	10	1	Ey! Don't call me fat!  Mom, don't laugh.	['fat']
Other	4	0	I'm sorry, hon,	[]
Cartman	9	0	I can't go with you guys right now.	[]
Stan	4	0	Yes you can, porky.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Mom, seriously!	[]
Other	13	1	Oh, that's not funny, boys. Eric isn't fat, his big-boned.	['fat']
Kyle	10	1	He must have a huge bone in his ass, then.	['ass']
Cartman	3	1	God-damnit, mom!	['damnit']
Cartman	5	0	God, I hate you guys!	[]
Stan	11	0	Okay, so we figured out how to scare the fifth graders.	[]
Cartman	1	0	How?	[]
Stan	8	0	What's the scariest thing we could get?	[]
Cartman	2	0	Spooky spider?	[]
Stan	4	0	No!  A dead body.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Yeah, fatass, a dead body.	[]
Cartman	11	0	You mean, we make something that looks like a dead body?	[]
Stan	19	0	We could never make one that looks real enough.  To be really scary, it would have to be real.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Yeah, fatass, it has to be real to be scary!	[]
Cartman	12	1	So where the hell are we going to get a dead body?	['hell']
Stan	9	0	We're gonna dig up Kyle's dead grandma.	[]
Kyle	13	0	Yeah, fatass, we're gonna dig up-  Dig up Kyle's dead grandma??	[]
Stan	12	0	Dude, she's perfect. She only died, like, three months ago, right?	[]
Kyle	3	0	Are you insane?!	[]
Cartman	8	0	U-hi think that's a sweet idea!	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Yeah!)	[]
Kyle	13	0	Dude! We're not digging up my grandma; I'll get in trouble.	[]
Stan	27	0	All we have to do is sneak in the graveyard, dig her up, scare the fifth graders, then put her back before anyone notices she's gone,	[]
Kyle	7	0	Naww, let's dig up somebody else.	[]
Stan	26	0	Relax, dude. What's the big deal? Think about it: if your grandma knew that she could help you, even in death, she would want to.	[]
Cartman	5	0	This is gonna be fun!	[]
Cartman	28	0	Just hear those sleigh bells jingle-in', ring ting tingle-in' too Outside it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you, and you, and you.	[]
Stan	19	0	Cartman, will you stop singing Christmas carols? We have to be quiet, or else we're gonna get busted!	[]
Kyle	10	0	This must be it. Cleo Broflovski That's my grandma.	[]
Stan	6	0	Well, let's dig 'er up!	[]
Kyle	9	0	Wait. I don't know if this is cool.	[]
Stan	13	0	Of course it's cool! She's gonna be all rotted and scary!	[]
Kyle	11	0	I don't think my mom would want me doin' this.	[]
Cartman	19	0	Ooh, I don't wanna dig up my dead grandma 'cause I'm such a goody-two-shoes!  Ow.	[]
Stan	16	0	You guys be quiet! Now, do you wanna get back at the fifth graders or not?!	[]
Kyle	6	0	I don't really care, dude.	[]
Stan	5	0	Yes you do! Now, dig!	[]
Cartman	11	0	Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling, You-hoo...	[]
Stan	11	0	Okay. It's almost open. Ready? One, two, three!  Whoa, dude.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Oh, my God.  Hi, ...Grandma.	[]
Other	2	0	Hi, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Aaaah!	[]
Cartman	13	0	Have you been a good boy, Kyle? Have you been making Grandma proud?	[]
Kyle	6	1	Damnit, Cartman, that's not funny!	['damnit']
Stan	5	0	Eheh, yes, it ihis, heh.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Heh heh, I'm sweet.	[]
Kyle	14	0	Alright, alright, let's get this over with so we can put her back!	[]
Stan	4	0	Okay, grab the sled.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Silver Bells, Silver Bells, it's Christmas time in the city...	[]
Stan	28	0	Okay. Let's just hide her here, and tomorrow, during the Halloween party, we'll come back in our costumes and use her to scare the fifth graders.	[]
Kyle	10	0	How exactly are we gonna use her to scare them?	[]
Cartman	20	1	We could shove a stick up her ass and use her like a puppet: Rowr, rowr, I'm scary Grandma!	['ass']
Kyle	16	1	Alright, that does it, Cartman! That's my grandma! You show her some God-damned respect!	['damned']
Other	5	0	O-o-o-o-oh.	[]
Stan	3	0	Who was that?	[]
Kyle	1	0	Cartman?!	[]
Cartman	4	0	It wasn't me!	[]
Other	3	0	Who-o-oa.	[]
Stan	6	0	Dude, not cool. This is scary.	[]
Other	4	0	Wa-a-a-ah!	[]
Other	7	0	Hey! Like, it's just some kids.	[]
Other	10	0	Oh, fwooh, I was really scared there, for a second.	[]
Stan	6	0	Hay, you're that band KoRn.	[]
Other	24	0	Yeah. I'm Jonathan , and this is Munky , David , Fieldy , and Head . And over there is our pal, Nibblet.  Hey, where'd Nibblet go?	[]
Other	6	0	Uh-huh, Nibblet likes potato chips.	[]
Other	1	0	Nibblet!	[]
Other	1	0	Okay.	[]
Stan	7	0	What are you guys doing out here?	[]
Other	23	0	We were just driving our van when all of a sudden we were run off the road by some super-spooky pirate ghosts.	[]
Stan	8	0	Aw, dude, that was just the fifth graders.	[]
Kyle	12	1	Yeah. They're tryin' to scare everybody 'cause they're gay wads.	['gay']
Stan	11	0	Don't worry. We're about to go get 'em back.	[]
Other	16	0	Oh, swell. We're supposed to play here tomorrow. Do you know where the stage is?	[]
Stan	7	0	Yeah, dude. It's right over there.	[]
Other	2	0	O-kay!	[]
Other	14	0	Oh, hi. We're KoRn. We're supposed to play the Halloween concert tomorrow.	[]
Other	19	0	I know who you are and what you stand for! I think your music and Halloween is an abomination!	[]
Other	9	0	Groovy! Could you show us where to set up?	[]
Stan	11	0	Alright, let's just set her over here behind these boxes.	[]
Kyle	8	0	Shouldn't we hide her better than that?	[]
Stan	34	0	Kyle, will you stop worrying? God! Now, we'll all be back here tomorrow with our costumes, and then, when the Halloween party gets going, we'll bust out dead Grandma! Let's go!	[]
Kyle	12	0	Wait till you guys see my costume! It's gonna be sweet!	[]
Kenny	10	1	(Mine is so fuckin' badass it's gotta win now!)	['fuckin']
Cartman	18	0	Oh, come on, Kenny! You never have a sweet costume! You're not gonna win the costume contest!	[]
Kenny	28	0	(Yes I am! I've got the costume; it's waiting in the house! Yesterday I got this huge package in the mail, and it was big, okay?)	[]
Other	3	0	Hold on, kids.	[]
Other	2	0	Mrs. Broflovski?	[]
Other	1	0	Yes?	[]
Other	13	0	We're from Mt. Peaceful Cemetery. Could we have a word with you?	[]
Other	7	0	Eehh, sure, come in.  What is it?	[]
Other	9	0	Ms. Broflovski... somebody has defiled your mother's grave.	[]
Other	2	0	Defiled? How?	[]
Other	9	0	Well, I'm afraid that... somebody dug her up.	[]
Other	4	0	Dug her up? Why??	[]
Other	16	1	Well. The- most likely reason is that... somebody wanted to have sex with her dead body.	['sex']
Other	1	0	Yeahp.	[]
Other	1	0	What?!	[]
Other	22	0	Uhuh, we don't want to upset you, but it happens. Somebody's probably making love to her corpse as we speak.	[]
Other	7	0	Every vile position, every disrespectful act imaginable.	[]
Other	3	0	Hoh, dear God!	[]
Other	19	0	Yes. By now he's probably even removed her eyes and made love to the empty sockets as well.	[]
Other	1	0	Oooh.	[]
Other	41	0	No-, we don't want to upset you, but you should know that your mother's body would be stiff and dry, so he would have to have it soaked in warm water for several hours before making love to it.	[]
Other	5	0	O-o-o-o-oh!	[]
Other	7	0	Yes. And, now for the difficult part.	[]
Other	2	0	Brace yourself.	[]
Other	28	0	It is highly possible that he has created new orifices in her decomposing flesh, leaving her to look something like - an overloved hunk of Swiss cheese. She probably-	[]
Other	16	0	Okay, okay! I get the point! Just tell me what you're gonna do about it!	[]
Other	1	0	...Do?	[]
Other	11	0	Oh, we don't do anything. We're just the watchmen.	[]
Other	12	0	Yeah, I guess, maybe, you might wanna call the police or something.	[]
Other	3	0	O-o-ogh!	[]
Other	22	0	Now, he probably would make love to the dead body in a cool dry place, so as not to allow further decomposition.	[]
Other	5	0	Package delivery for Mrs. Cartman?	[]
Cartman	12	0	A package? Oh, really? Well, I think I can sign for that!	[]
Other	6	0	Sign heah, and heah, and heah.	[]
Cartman	63	1	I got a Christmas present! I got a Christmas present!  ...Maybe I can see what it is. I'll just open one little corner.  Let's see here.  That's good, I'll rewrap it later!  Oh, sweet! Life-sized blow-up Antonio Banderas love doll! With realistic geni-ta-lia.  Oh, this kicks ass! What a cool Christmas present my mom got!	['ass']
Other	15	0	It's Halloween day, so come on down to the docks and bring your costumes!	[]
Stan	12	0	Where's Kenny? He said he had the best Halloween costume ever.	[]
Cartman	20	0	Nyah nyahnyahnyah nyah nyah. Guess wha-at I got? Antonio Banderas blow-up doll. You guys didn't get one.	[]
Stan	5	0	Where's your costume, fatass?	[]
Cartman	45	0	Screw Halloween, I already got my Christmas present! In a few days I'll wrap it back up, and then when I open it on Christmas, I'll act all, like, surprised, like Oh Mother, Antonio Banderas life-sized blow-up doll! What a surprise!	[]
Stan	2	0	Hey, Kenny.	[]
Kenny	10	1	(Hey, guys. Uh, check out this kick-ass cool costume.)	['ass']
Cartman	15	0	U-huh, nice costume, Kenny. If you think you're gonna win with that, huh!	[]
Stan	20	0	Alright. The fifth graders are gonna be here soon. Let's get Kyle's grandma!  This is gonna be sweet	[]
Cartman	3	0	Uuh, problem, guys.	[]
Stan	4	0	What's the problem?	[]
Cartman	2	0	Nno Grandma.	[]
Kyle	2	0	No Grandma??	[]
Cartman	2	0	Nno Grandma.	[]
Kyle	4	0	She's not here!	[]
Stan	5	0	She has to be here!	[]
Kyle	20	0	Well, she's not here! That's just great! Thanks a lot, Stan! You're gonna get me busted again!	[]
Other	41	1	Okay, people. I know we all want to get down to the docks for the Halloween Haunt, but first we just need to inform you about thee- people or persons out there digging up bodies to have sex with them. Gentlemen?	['sex']
Other	44	2	Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. A person who steals bodies to have sex with them is called a necrophiliac. So that you all know what to expect, my partner Alan has a sketch of what having sex with a dead body might look like.	['sex', 'sex']
Other	2	0	Ee-oooh!	[]
Other	29	1	Yes, we know it's horrible. It's probably best you not look at it. Now, Alan will demonstrate what having sex with a dead body might sound like.	['sex']
Other	1	0	Awwwgh!	[]
Other	6	0	Excuse me, how is this helping?	[]
Other	17	0	That's it, folks. Now, we can all go to the docks and enjoy the Halloween Haunt.	[]
Other	36	1	Noo! Don't go to the docks!  Aarrrgh!  Argh, I'm Captain Bly! You land-lubbers had better stay away from the docks! Or else, there'll be hell to pay!  Fire the cannon!  Har harharharhar!	['hell']
Other	1	0	Arrrgh!	[]
Other	11	0	We won't warn ya again! Stay away from our docks!	[]
Other	30	0	I warned you! I told you this would happen!  When you allow bands like KoRn to come to town and play your hedonistic Halloween concerts, this is what you get!	[]
Other	17	0	Great rehearsal, gang. That was really groovy. Let's practice one more time before the show starts.	[]
Other	12	0	Aah, guys, I'm sorry, but the Halloween Haunt's been cancelled.	[]
Other	1	0	Cancelled?	[]
Other	15	0	You best clear out of here! There's pirate ghosts, and they'll kill you.	[]
Other	11	0	Well gang, it looks like we have to pack it up.	[]
Other	1	0	Awww.	[]
Kyle	10	2	God-damnit! Now, what the hell are we gonna do?!	['damnit', 'hell']
Other	7	0	Oh, hey! The kids from last night.	[]
Other	11	0	Wow! Is that the Antonio Banderas life-sized blow-up doll?	[]
Other	2	0	Hey, Kenny.	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Aw, man!)	[]
Other	11	0	Say, what's the matter? You kids look kind of glum.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Somebody took my dead grandma.	[]
Other	1	0	What?	[]
Stan	19	0	We dug her up 'cause we wanted to scare the fifth graders, but then, something took her body away.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Now she's doomed to walk the earth in limbo.	[]
Other	8	0	Aw, I hate to see little clowns cry.	[]
Other	22	0	Well, that does it. Somethin' funny is going on here. Your missing grandma must be connected somehow to those creepy pirate ghosts.	[]
Other	10	0	They're not pirate ghosts, Jonathan, they're ghost pirates.	[]
Other	1	0	Huh?	[]
Other	29	0	Pirate ghost would suggest that a pirate died, and became a ghost, but a ghost pirate is a ghost that later made a conscious decision to be a pirate.	[]
Other	14	0	No, David. Then they are pirate ghosts, because they're the ghosts of pirates.	[]
Other	24	0	You're wrong, because there were no pirates in Colorado. So these must be ghosts that have decided to become pirates after the fact.	[]
Other	6	0	But that makes them pirate ghosts.	[]
Other	6	0	No. It makes them ghost pirates.	[]
Other	2	0	Pirate ghosts!	[]
Other	24	0	Guys! Guys! Guys! Fighting isn't gonna solve anything. Don't you see? This is exactly what those ghost pirates want us to do.	[]
Other	2	0	Pirate ghosts.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Then, you'll help us?	[]
Other	22	0	Sure, we'll help you. If there's one thing we like more than playing music, it's solvin' a groovy mystery.	[]
Other	2	0	Al-right!	[]
Chef	3	0	Is everybody okay?	[]
Other	19	1	People stealing bodies to have sex with them? Pirate ghosts destroying the town? When did everything go so wrong?	['sex']
Other	28	0	I hate to say it, but I think Priest Maxi was right. This is what we get for celebrating Halloween and allowing that band KoRn to come play.	[]
Mr. Garrison	17	0	He's right! Nothin' ever went wrong in this town before that evil KoRn band showed up.	[]
Other	16	1	Well, I say we go find them and kick their devil-worshiping butts out of town!	['butts']
Other	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Randy	2	0	Lynch mob!	[]
Other	3	0	Down with KoRn!	[]
Other	10	0	So this is where you last saw your dead grandma.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Right.	[]
Stan	11	0	Maybe there really are pirate ghosts and they took her inside.	[]
Other	11	0	Alright, gang, we have to split up and look for clues.	[]
Stan	5	0	How should we split up?	[]
Other	34	0	I know. Let's have everyone who enjoys having obstacles in their life, which they can overcome, go this way,  and everyone whose insecurities sabotage their potential to overcome those obstacles go that way.	[]
Other	2	0	O-kay!	[]
Kyle	4	0	Wow! That was easy.	[]
Randy	8	0	Here's their van! Here's their van!	[]
Other	5	0	Let's flip it over!	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Other	26	0	Okay, people, let's try to stay orderly. The best way to do this is, all get on one side and push it from the top.	[]
Other	2	0	Devil worshipers!	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Other	8	0	Come on, they gotta be around here somewhere!	[]
Stan	6	0	This place gives me the creeps.	[]
Other	22	0	Say, this looks like a clue.  Pirate Lore of South Park. Hmmm. Now, why would pirate ghosts need a book on pirates?	[]
Kyle	4	0	Whoa. What was that?	[]
Other	9	0	The noise came from in here. Stay close, everybody!	[]
Other	6	0	Oh, no! I lost my glasses.	[]
Other	7	0	What does this dead grandma look like?	[]
Cartman	10	0	Uh, she was all, like, crunchy and crispy and stuff.	[]
Other	11	0	Hey, I got an idea.  We should set a groovy trap.	[]
Other	2	0	Good idea.	[]
Cartman	9	0	How do we trap a bunch of pirate ghosts?	[]
Other	19	0	We need something that might catch their eye to use as bait. I know, your Antonio Banderas love doll.	[]
Cartman	20	0	Oh, no! This is my Christmas present! If anything happens to it, my mom will know I opened it early!	[]
Other	12	0	Come on, kid. We all have to do our part, even Antonio.	[]
Other	22	0	My glasses gotta be around here somewhere.  Is that you, Jonathan? Boy, I'm glad to see you. I lost my glasses.	[]
Other	1	0	Raaarrrgh!	[]
Other	6	0	Hey, you got a cold, Jonathan?	[]
Other	1	0	Raarraarrgh!	[]
Other	11	0	Yeah, that sounds like a groovy song, man! Remember that one!	[]
Other	5	0	Fieldy, what are you doing?!	[]
Other	28	0	Oh, I was talking to you, Jonathan. ...Hey, wait a minute. If you're over there, then how could you be over here? Unless you're actually a...	[]
Other	4	0	Puh-puuhh pirate ghost!	[]
Other	1	0	Raaarrrgh!	[]
Other	53	0	Okay. Here's how the trap will work. When the pirate ghosts walk in, they should go right for Antonio Banderas.  When they hit the super-slippery floor, they'll slide onto this mining cart, which should travel down this path, into the next room, where the fish net will fall on them.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Wow, cool!	[]
Other	4	0	Hey! Somebody's coming.	[]
Other	1	0	Aaaaah!	[]
Stan	5	0	We've got to hide!	[]
Other	11	0	Hey, there's Antonio Banderas! He'll help us.  Mr. Banderas!	[]
Other	2	0	Jonathan, no!	[]
Other	1	0	Aaaah!	[]
Other	2	0	Oh, no!	[]
Other	1	0	Aaaah!	[]
Stan	1	0	Ow!	[]
Other	3	0	Hold on, guys!	[]
Other	10	0	Alright, KoRn, time for you to get out of town!	[]
Other	1	0	Aarrrrgh.	[]
Other	1	0	Aaaaaah!	[]
Randy	8	0	KoRn is sending their demon minions upon us!	[]
Other	1	0	Aaaaaah!	[]
Other	17	0	Alright, gang. Looks like we're gonna have to use our special KoRn powers.  KoRn powers, vitalize!	[]

Other	4	0	Alright! Great job, gang!	[]
Cartman	6	0	That didn't help at all.	[]
Other	8	0	We know. It's just cool to do.	[]
Other	1	0	Aarrrrgh!	[]
Other	1	0	Nibblet!	[]
Other	1	0	Nibblet!	[]
Other	6	1	What the hell is that thing??	['hell']
Other	7	0	You did it, Nibblet! You trapped them!	[]
Other	20	0	Yeah. And now let's see who these pirate ghosts really are!  Oh, I guess they really were pirate ghosts.	[]
Other	13	0	Alright, KoRn, you can stop your demonic shenanigans and come downtown with me!	[]
Other	5	0	Hehey, look what Nibblet sees.	[]
Other	1	0	Whoa!	[]
Chef	2	0	What the...?	[]
Other	2	0	Father Maxi?	[]
Other	10	0	Well, what are you waiting for, Barbrady?! Arrest that band!	[]
Other	1	0	Oh?	[]
Other	3	0	No! Arrest him!	[]
Other	1	0	Huh??	[]
Other	9	0	I think I've got this groovy mystery solved!	[]
Chef	12	0	Well, I must say I still don't get this at all.	[]
Other	23	0	It's simple. Priest Maxi didn't want there to be a Halloween, so he decided to scare everyone away from the docks.	[]
Other	15	0	Yeah. And then he used this flashlight and some cotton swabs to create the ghosts.	[]
Other	18	0	Then all he needed was some sound effects created by this cup and a piece of cheese.  Aaaaraargh!	[]
Other	21	0	And all he had to do then was create a ghost ship, by using some candles, a mirror, and two squirrels.	[]
Chef	9	0	Father, why did you go to all this trouble?	[]
Other	17	0	Because Halloween is an abomination of God. I would do anything to stop this wretched, unholy holiday!	[]
Chef	10	0	Including killing people and wreaking havoc all over South Park?	[]
Other	18	1	Don't you see that by trying to stop Halloween you've scared the hell out of everybody?	['hell']
Other	1	0	No.	[]
Other	6	0	Okay buddy, you can explain downtown!	[]
Other	19	0	Well, this is all fine and good, but it doesn't explain what happened to my mother's body!	[]
Kyle	4	0	Yeah! Where's Grandma?	[]
Other	1	0	Eeewww!	[]
Stan	3	0	There she is!	[]
Other	1	0	Oooh!	[]
Other	2	1	Ho-hoh.	['ho']
Chef	13	0	Well thanks a lot, KoRn! You KoRn powers really came through for us!	[]
Other	14	0	Yes! We were wrong about you. Will you please play for our Halloween party?	[]
Other	6	0	Well, sure. Why the heck not?	[]
Other	2	0	All right!	[]
Other	1	0	Raarrrr!	[]
Stan	7	0	Oh, no! The pirate ghosts are back!	[]
Other	1	0	Nibblet!	[]
Other	2	0	Uh oh!	[]
Other	83	0	Well, this sure has been a wacky night, but me and the gang learned a lot, and we hope you did too. You all perceived us to be mean, evil people, but, really, we're just normal guys. And we all perceived pirate ghosts to be real when, actually, they were just cotton swabs. So I guess the lesson is: it's easy to perceive somethin' someway, and then be wrong. So we all need to learn to be a little less perceptive.	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Other	26	0	The gang and I wrote a song about it, and it goes goes a little somethin' like this:And a-one, and-a-two, and a	[]
Stan	1	0	Boo!	[]
Other	1	0	Aaaah!	[]
Other	1	0	Sweet!	[]
Cartman	15	1	Antonio, no!  You son of a bitch chicken from outer space... thing, come back here!	['bitch']
