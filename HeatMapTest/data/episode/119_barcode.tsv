Other	8	0	Hey, South Park! Do you have school spirit?	[]
Other	1	0	Moooooooo!	[]
Bebe	11	0	I think us Cows have the best school spirit. Huh, Mandy?	[]
Other	13	0	Yeah, and South Park is really gonna stick it to Littleton next week!	[]
Bebe	12	0	Let's bring out our mascot and get this pep rally going!	[]
Butters	11	0	It's Mooey! Mooey, wave to me! Wave to me, Mooey!	[]
Cartman	5	1	Butters, shut the hell up!	['hell']
Other	20	0	We are People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals! We protest your insensitive use of cows as your school mascot!	[]
Other	5	0	Oh, Jesus, not PeTA again.	[]
Other	10	0	Cows are maimed and slaughtered and used as a commodity!	[]
Other	11	0	This is the fate of the cow! This is your insensitivity!	[]
Other	1	0	Ewww!	[]
Other	19	0	The cow is a slave! The cow is a commodity! To be thrown away by a society gone wrong!	[]
Other	30	0	All right, children, I have just been informed that since our school has been attacked by eco-terrorists for the 47th time, we are going to change our school mascot.	[]
Other	1	0	Awwwwwwww!	[]
Stan	14	0	But, Mr. Garrison, if we change our mascot, that means the eco-terrorists win!	[]
Other	44	0	That's right, Stanley, the eco-terrorists win.  Now, I have here a mascot selection sheet. Every student is supposed to check the box next to the mascot they like the most. And the most popular selection will be the school's new mascot.	[]
Clyde	6	0	But we like being the Cows!	[]
Other	10	0	You're responsible for the enslavement and genocide of millions!	[]
Other	11	0	Ge-get outta here, PeTA! We're changin' the mascot already!	[]
Other	10	0	Who'll speak for those who cannot speak for themselves?!	[]
Other	20	0	Oh, ge-get outta here!  Ge-get out!  Jesus, where do they keep coming from?!  Go on, get outta here.	[]
Stan	4	1	This is bullcrap, dude!	['bullcrap']
Other	28	0	Now children, it's not that bad. There's plenty of great new mascots on the sheet to chose from. The Hurricanes, the Blizzards, the Redskins, the Indians...	[]
Wendy	9	0	But aren't Indians and Redskins just as offensive?	[]
Other	10	0	No, those are fine. PETA doesn't care about people.	[]
Cartman	22	2	Goddammit, vegans piss me off! Now we're gonna end up with a stupid eagle or a faggy bobcat as a mascot.	['goddammit', 'faggy']
Kyle	37	1	Wait. You guys, I have an awesome idea! We should secretly go around and tell all the students we can, to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet, and instead write in Giant Douche.	['douche']
Cartman	2	0	Ye-heah!	[]
Kenny	3	0	(Yeah, totally awesome!)	[]
Cartman	46	1	Yeh- no, no, wait, wait. I got a better idea you guys. What we should do is we should secretly go around and tell all the students we can to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet, and instead write in Turd Sandwich.	['turd']
Kyle	8	2	Turd Sandwich isn't better than Giant Douche.	['turd', 'douche']
Cartman	27	0	Heh, it's only about a thousand times better, am I right guys? Come on! We have to tell everybody fast! This is gonna be so funny!	[]
Kyle	19	1	It was my idea and we're gonna tell everyone to write in Giant Douche! It's way funnier!	['douche']
Cartman	3	0	It is not!	[]
Kyle	11	2	Kenny, what's funnier? A giant douche or a turd sandwich?	['douche', 'turd']
Kenny	2	1	(Giant douche.)	['douche']
Cartman	15	0	Aw, you're just saying that because I broke your cat's leg last week.	[]
Kyle	9	2	Stan, do you pick giant douche or turd sandwich?	['douche', 'turd']
Stan	6	0	Dude, I really don't care.	[]
Kyle	15	1	That's two against one, 'cause Stan doesn't care. So it's giant douche.	['douche']
Cartman	5	0	...Wait, wait, what about Butters?	[]
Butters	1	0	Huh?	[]
Kyle	3	0	You hate Butters.	[]
Cartman	31	3	Goddammit, you guys, Butters is our friend! And he's allowed to have his opinion! Butters, which is funnier? A stupid not-funny giant douche or a super funny turd sandwich?	['goddammit', 'douche', 'turd']
Butters	4	1	Hahaha, a turd sandwich!	['turd']
Kyle	4	0	You misled him, fatass!	[]
Cartman	13	0	It's the best choice, and me and Butters are sticking with it.	[]
Butters	5	0	Yeah! ...What's this for?	[]
Kyle	25	0	Jimmy, we're gonna have everyone write in a mascot that's really funny, and you have to tell us which one would be funnier.	[]
Other	23	0	That's a... fantastic idea fellas. Uh, the key to successful humor is s-staying power. Uh, tell me the first mascot idea.	[]
Kyle	3	1	A giant douche.	['douche']
Other	12	0	Heh, huh okay, that's pretty funny. Now, what's the second?	[]
Cartman	3	1	A turd sandwich.	['turd']
Other	18	0	Turhr... Ohokahay. Okay, now let's wait ten seconds.  Okay now, t-tell me the first one again?	[]
Kyle	2	1	Giant douche.	['douche']
Other	3	0	And the second?	[]
Cartman	2	1	Turd sandwich.	['turd']
Other	28	0	Gee, th-they're both screamingly funny, fellas. Better give it another ten seconds. All right, now we'll see which one really has staying power. Number one?	[]
Kyle	3	1	A giant douche.	['douche']
Other	8	0	Okay, I think, that's it. Number 2?	[]
Cartman	2	1	Turd sandwich.	['turd']
Other	44	1	Gee, I don't know what to say, fellas. They're both instant classics. But I guess I'll have to go with giant douche, simply because the fact that it's a giant renders it useless, adding a parody slant to the satire.	['douche']
Cartman	1	0	Awwwww!	[]
Butters	3	0	Ohhh, we lost?	[]
Kyle	12	1	All right, it's decided. Let's all write in Giant Douche.	['douche']
Cartman	4	0	Okay. You win, Kyle.	[]
Other	34	1	Attention students, we have tallied your mascot nomination sheets, and there will now be a school-wide vote between the top two nominations. So here is the first most-requested candidate, a giant douche.	['douche']
Other	3	1	Go, giant douche!	['douche']
Other	24	2	Hey, South Park! Have we got school spirit?!  We've got spirit, yes we do! Giant douches, me and you! Let's gooooo, Douches!	['douches', 'douches']
Other	7	1	And now your second nominee, Turd Sandwich.	['turd']
Cartman	4	1	All right turd sandwich!	['turd']
Butters	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Kyle	4	1	Cartman? What the hell?!	['hell']
Cartman	3	1	Giant Douche sucks!	['douche']
Other	14	1	We've got spirit, yes we do! We are sandwiches filled with poo! Yeeaahhh!	['poo']
Other	22	2	Students can now cast their choice between the Giant Douche and the Turd Sandwich. We'll count up the votes on Tuesday.	['douche', 'turd']
Kyle	9	1	You won't get more votes than us, asshole!	['asshole']
Cartman	4	1	Game on, Jew-boy!	['jew']
Butters	5	1	Yeah, game on, Jew-boy!	['jew']
Kyle	7	1	Be sure to vote for Giant Douche.	['douche']
Kenny	5	1	(Giant Douche! Vote for him!)	['douche']
Kyle	5	1	Giant Douche is your man!	['douche']
Stan	24	1	Kyle, aren't you taking this a little too far? I mean, do we really want a giant douche to be our school mascot?	['douche']
Kyle	13	1	Dude, I'm not going to lose to Cartman's stupid turd sandwich.	['turd']
Cartman	30	3	Vote for Turd Sandwich. This is the most important election of our lives.  Turd Sandwich brings us hope for change. A vote for Turd Sandwich is a Vote for tomorrow!	['turd', 'turd', 'turd']
Kyle	9	1	There. Do you really want that asshole to win?	['asshole']
Stan	4	0	I'm not voting!	[]
Kyle	23	0	What? Y-you gotta vote, dude. Haven't you seen the Rock the Vote stuff or, or Puff Daddy's Vote or Die?!	[]
Stan	8	0	I just think this whole thing is stupid!	[]
Kyle	20	0	Kenny, we have got to make Stan understand the importance of voting, because he'll definitely vote for our guy.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Yeah.)	[]
Other	5	0	How was school today, Stanley?	[]
Stan	25	2	It was ridiculous. We have to have a new school mascot and we're supposed to vote between a giant douche and a turd sandwich.	['douche', 'turd']
Other	4	0	...What did you say?	[]
Randy	8	0	Did you just say that... voting is ridiculous?	[]
Stan	25	2	No, I think voting is great, but, if I have to choose between a douche and a turd, I just don't see the point.	['douche', 'turd']
Randy	14	0	You don't see the point! Oh, you young people just make me sick!	[]
Other	16	0	Stanley, do you know how many people died so you could have the right to vote?!	[]
Stan	25	2	Mom, a-I just don't think there's much of a difference between a douche and a turd. I d-I don't care.	['douche', 'turd']
Randy	20	2	You don't care?! You really want a turd sandwich as your school mascot?! On your football helmets?! A turd?!	['turd', 'turd']
Other	22	2	Well, hold on, Randy, I think a turd sandwich is a little better than them having a giant douche on their uniforms.	['turd', 'douche']
Randy	11	1	You're crazy!! A d-a douche is at least clean!	['douche']
Other	7	1	It's sexist, is what it is!	['sexist']
Randy	7	0	You don't understand the issues, Sharon!	[]
Other	5	0	Are you calling me ignorant?!	[]
Randy	16	1	You think the school mascot should be a turd sandwich? Well you're not exactly Einstein!	['turd']
Other	13	1	I am sick of you belittling my opinion, you son of a bitch!	['bitch']
Other	7	0	I hate this family, I hate it!	[]
Stan	2	0	Puff Daddy?	[]
Other	13	0	Your friend Kyle told me you don't understand the importance of voting.	[]
Stan	1	0	I...	[]
Other	11	0	Apparently, you haven't heard of my Vote or Die campaign.	[]
Stan	10	1	Vote or Die?  What the hell does that even mean?!	['hell']
Other	6	1	What you think it means, bitch!	['bitch']
Stan	1	0	Aaaah!	[]
Other	8	2	Vote or die, motherfucker, motherfucker, vote or die!	['motherfucker', 'motherfucker']
Other	14	0	Rock the vote or else I'm gonna stick a knife through your eye.	[]
Other	7	0	Democracy is founded on one simple rule!	[]
Other	12	1	Get out there and vote or I will motherfucking kill you.  Yeah.	['motherfucking']
Other	45	8	I like it when you vote, bitch! (bitch!) Shake them titties when you vote, bitch! (bitch!) I slam my jimmy through your mouth roof (mouth roof) Now get your big ass in the pollin' booth. I said vote, bitch, or I'll fucking kill you!	['bitch', 'bitch', 'titties', 'bitch', 'bitch', 'ass', 'bitch', 'fucking']
Other	8	2	Vote or die, motherfucker, motherfucker, vote or die!	['motherfucker', 'motherfucker']
Other	11	0	You can't run from a .38, go ahead and try!	[]
Other	10	0	Let your opinion be heard! You gotta make a choice	[]
Other	13	1	'Cause after I slit your throat you won't have a fucking voice	['fucking']
Other	6	0	Vote or die! Vote or die!	[]
Stan	4	0	...Okay. I'll vote.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Hello, Clyde.	[]
Clyde	5	0	What do you guys want?	[]
Cartman	16	0	We were just wondering who you might be voting for, for the school's new mascot.	[]
Clyde	5	0	I haven't decided yet.	[]
Cartman	19	0	Oh really? Well, that's interesting. You certainly should think about it and make the right decision.  Butterscotch candy?	[]
Clyde	1	0	Sure.	[]
Cartman	13	1	Clyde, are you aware of what Turd Sandwich can bring to our school?	['turd']
Butters	19	2	A turd sandwich is not only the first turd to be nominated school mascot, but even the first sandwich.	['turd', 'turd']
Cartman	25	2	You see, what Turd Sandwich brings to our school, Clyde, is a complete package. The turd and the bread. And the lettuce, and the olives.	['turd', 'turd']
Butters	17	2	Whe-where as Giant Douche is just, well, ju-just a, ju-ju-just a giant douche.	['douche', 'douche']
Cartman	15	1	So, come voting day, you'll now most likely vote for the turd sandwich, yes?	['turd']
Clyde	6	0	I'm still not totally sure.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Well then, perhaps we could interest you in  another butterscotch candy?	[]
Kyle	19	0	You're doing the right thing, Stan. Don't you feel like you're a part of something now?	[]
Stan	2	0	I guess...	[]
Kyle	21	0	Look, it may not seem important now, but your vote really does count, and we all have to do our part.	[]
Stan	1	0	Okay.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Woah... wait, what are you doing?	[]
Stan	3	0	I'm voting.	[]
Kyle	8	1	No, no, you... you wrote down Turd Sandwich.	['turd']
Stan	3	0	Yeah, I know.	[]
Kyle	9	1	...Dude, you're supposed to vote for Giant Douche.	['douche']
Stan	10	0	I thought I was supposed to make my own decision.	[]
Kyle	18	2	Well yeah, but not if your decision is for Turd Sandwich! What the hell is wrong with you?!	['turd', 'hell']
Stan	18	0	Wait a minute, you didn't want me to vote, you wanted me to vote for your guy!	[]
Kyle	17	1	Well, I just figured you'd vote for my guy! Who's fuckin' friend are you?!  Puffy!	['fuckin']
Cartman	34	1	Hey, fuck off, Kyle.  Don't let them intimidate you, Stan. I'll help walk you to the booth. And then I'm gonna buy you a nice steak dinner with all the trimmings.	['fuck']
Stan	44	0	Oh, forget it! I'm not gonna be persuaded into voting and I'm and I'm not gonna be threatened into voting if I don't feel comfortable with it! I'm not gonna vote and you can all just live with it!	[]
Other	22	0	We've simply had it with your son, Mr. and Mrs. Marsh. Voting just doesn't appear to be important to him.	[]
Randy	15	0	Stanley, when you left for school this morning, you said you were going to vote!	[]
Stan	6	0	The whole thing is a joke!	[]
Other	15	0	You see? He's out of control. It's nearly torn our whole family apart.	[]
Other	21	0	Well, my hands are tied. We can no longer have Stan's behavior jeopardizing the other children. He must be removed.	[]
Randy	11	0	Oh! Are you happy now, Stan? You just got yourself suspended!	[]
Other	21	0	No, I'm afraid it's worse than that. By county law I'm bound to enforce the harshest punishment possible.	[]
Randy	1	0	Expulsion?!	[]
Other	2	0	No. Banishment.	[]
Stan	3	0	B-bani-banishment?	[]
Other	26	0	You can appeal to the city council, but I don't think it'll do any good. Your son must leave South Park, never to return.	[]
Other	2	0	Oh, Randy!	[]
Randy	8	0	Our son, banished! Where did we go wrong?!	[]
Stan	6	0	You-you're all joking, right?	[]
Other	54	0	As it was in the times of our forefathers, so it is now. Stan Marsh, for not following our most sacred of rites, you are hereby banished from South Park for all eternity. Or until you decide that voting is important. Good-bye, Stan. May the gods treat you more kindly than we did.	[]
Kyle	23	1	Stan, don't you think this has gone far enough? Is it really that big a deal?  Yeah, just vote. For Giant Douche.	['douche']
Stan	4	0	I'm not voting!	[]
Other	19	0	Yo, Puffy man, are we just gonna let this happen?  We've gots to kill this non-votin' fool!	[]
Other	15	0	No, Justacious, let him go. He won't survive a fore-night in the wilderness.	[]
Randy	18	0	This is breaking your mother's heart, Stan. She couldn't even help tie you to the horse.	[]
Stan	7	0	Dad, isn't this a little extreme?	[]
Randy	27	0	Jesus. I guess maybe you'll never understand how important voting is.  Goodbye, Son.  That's... one of the hardest things a parent ever has to do.	[]
Other	4	0	Look! What is that?	[]
Other	4	0	Oh, the poor thing!	[]
Stan	1	0	Hello?	[]
Other	7	0	Don't worry, we'll free you.	[]
Other	6	0	Just sit still for a moment.	[]
Stan	3	0	Oh, thank God.	[]
Other	6	0	Get offa him, you filthy human!	[]
Other	4	0	Poor thing needs water.	[]
Other	4	0	You're safe now.	[]
Other	8	0	Shame on you, making this horse your slave.	[]
Stan	1	0	Awww!	[]
Other	6	0	Come, you can live with us.	[]
Other	7	0	We will give you food and shelter.	[]
Stan	3	0	What about me?	[]
Other	3	0	Open the gate!	[]
Other	10	0	This poor creature is in need of food and water.	[]
Other	6	0	You have a home here, friend.	[]
Other	6	0	The... kid wants to stay, too.	[]
Stan	12	0	I was put on the horse. I didn't wanna ride it.	[]
Other	85	0	I don't know if you can stay. We'll have to ask Dr. Cornwallis. Come.  We don't normally allow outsiders. See, here we live in harmony with animals. They're not our pets but our fellow living beings. We work with the animals and try to live as they do.  We make friends with the animals. We coexist, and we... intermarry.  This is my wife, Janice.  The outside world looks down on a man marrying a llama, but our love knows no boundaries.	[]
Stan	6	0	Wow, you guys really love animals.	[]
Other	26	0	And why not? Mark here has been with Kelly for three years now.  And Gary and Sally here have just managed to have a child together.	[]
Other	2	0	Kill me...	[]
Other	27	0	Yes, life here is good and natural. But now that you know where our compound is, you'll either have to live with us, or be murdered.	[]
Stan	5	0	I'll live with you.	[]
Other	18	0	It's not up to you. You'll have to talk with Dr. Cornwallis.  What did he say?	[]
Stan	5	0	He said I can stay.	[]
Other	17	0	Excellent! Dr. Cornwallis is wise beyond his year. Here's your PeTA shirt and a bumper sticker.	[]
Other	9	0	This is Debate 2004 with your host, Jim Lehrer.	[]
Other	42	4	Welcome to the cable-access televised debate between a giant douche  and a turd sandwich  We'll start with Giant Douche. Sir, some students and parents are reluctant to have a... giant douche represent them. What do you say to those people?	['douche', 'turd', 'douche', 'douche']
Other	29	0	Jim, first of all I would like to thank you for monitoring this debate. And I would like to thank all of the students and their parents for coming.	[]
Cartman	13	0	Aww, suck-up, suck-up!  What?! That's an obvious suck-up move.	[]
Other	25	1	But I would hope that those students and their parents who question my qualities would simply look at my opponent. He is a turd sandwich	['turd']
Other	5	1	You're a turd sandwich.	['turd']
Other	14	1	... No, sir, if you'll pardon me, you are in fact, the turd sandwich.	['turd']
Other	5	1	You're a turd sandwich.	['turd']
Other	6	1	... Sir, you are a turd sandwich.	['turd']
Other	5	1	You're a turd sandwich.	['turd']
Other	13	1	Ahh, Turd Sandwich, I will ask you not to speak out of turn.	['turd']
Other	5	0	I-I'm sorry, Jim.	[]
Other	14	0	Anyway, as I was saying, ahh... wait, I-I forgot what I was saying.	[]
Other	4	1	Ha. What a douche.	['douche']
Other	26	1	All right, Turd Sandwich, this next question is for you. How should South Park Elementary enforce its laws of conduct for young athletes during sporting events.	['turd']
Other	47	0	...Uh, you know, uh, my opponent wouldn't even know the answer to that question. If you ask him the same question, he would not answer it.  He would stand around and just babble on and on about nothing until he was finally saved by the buzze-.	[]
Other	5	1	Your time is up, Turd.	['turd']
Other	23	0	Stan, I want to introduce you to my stepdaughter, Teresa.  She seems to have taken a liking to you.  And she's ovulating.	[]
Stan	6	0	Ahh, no thanks, that's okay.	[]
Other	14	0	Stan, some PETA members are growing concerned that maybe you don't love animals.	[]
Stan	10	0	I do love animals, just ...not like you guys do.	[]
Other	10	0	You... don't belong here, Stan. You should return home.	[]
Stan	9	0	I can't. I was banished for not voting.	[]
Other	9	0	But, why on earth wouldn't you wanna vote?	[]
Stan	23	2	I think voting is great. I just didn't care this time because it was between a giant douche and a turd sandwich.	['douche', 'turd']
Other	49	4	But Stan, don't you know? It's always between a giant douche and a turd sandwich. Nearly every election since the beginning of time has been between some douche and some turd. They're the only people who suck up enough to make it that far in politics.	['douche', 'turd', 'douche', 'turd']
Stan	7	0	I guess... I guess you're right.	[]
Other	12	1	Yo, what did I say was going to happen to you, bitch?	['bitch']
Stan	1	0	Aaah!	[]
Other	21	0	Aaaah!! He's wearing the skin of an animal!  Take that!  I... hope that teaches you a lesson about being hurt.	[]
Other	2	0	Itius, Rodicus!	[]
Other	3	0	Vote or die!	[]
Stan	1	0	Aaaah!!	[]
Other	6	0	Protect the animals! Protect the animals!	[]
Other	10	0	Janice, we shall die together in each other's arms!	[]
Other	4	0	Kill me! Kill meee!!	[]
Mr. Mackey	10	1	M'kay... that's one more vote for Turd Sandwich.	['turd']
Randy	5	0	So who won, Mr. Mackey?	[]
Mr. Mackey	13	1	It's pretty close, but it looks like Giant Douche is gonna win.	['douche']
Cartman	3	0	Oh, no! Noooo!!	[]
Kyle	4	0	Ha! You lose, fatass!	[]
Butters	5	0	Uh hey, wait a minute!	[]
Randy	1	0	Stan!	[]
Other	13	0	Stan, you came back. Does that mean... you learned the importance of voting?	[]
Stan	28	2	I learned that I'd better get used to having to pick between a douche and a turd sandwich because it's usually the choice I'll have.	['douche', 'turd']
Randy	5	0	He's going to vote!	[]
Other	10	0	He's going to vote. He's going to vote.	[]
Other	50	5	Let's get out the vote! Let's make our voices heard! We've been given the right to choose between a douche and a turd. It's democracy in action! Put your freedom to the test. A big, fat turd or a stupid douche. Which do you like best?	['douche', 'turd', 'fat', 'turd', 'douche']
Mr. Mackey	27	3	Stan's vote bring the total votes for Turd Sandwich to... thirty six! And Giant Douche has... one thousand, four hundred, and ten. Giant Douche still wins!	['turd', 'douche', 'douche']
Other	3	0	Yeah! All right!	[]
Other	1	0	Aawwww!	[]
Stan	9	0	Dude, so my vote didn't even really matter!	[]
Randy	6	0	Hey! That's not true, Stan.	[]
Other	15	0	You can't judge the merits of voting on whether or not your candidate won.	[]
Randy	4	0	Your vote still mattered.	[]
Other	13	0	Hey everybody!  They just found all the PETA members murdered at their compound!	[]
Mr. Mackey	9	0	What the? They're all dead? Well, that means...	[]
Clyde	11	0	That we can go back to being the South Park Cows!	[]
Other	3	0	Hooray! All right!	[]
Randy	6	0	Now your vote didn't matter.	[]
