Cartman	18	0	I'm gonna do whatever I can... to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand.	[]
Kyle	8	0	You just want Family Guy off the air...	[]
Cartman	3	0	Kyle, stop it!	[]
Cartman	3	0	So long, Kyle!	[]
Kyle	11	1	You son of a bitch! I won't let you win!	['bitch']
Other	16	0	Mr. President, there's something about the Family Guy writing staff I think you should know.	[]
Other	24	0	And now, the thrilling conclusion of... Cartoon Wars... will not be seen tonight!  so that we can bring you this Terrance & Phillip Television Special	[]
Other	15	0	Say Terrance, isn't it wonderful having a holiday here at the Lazy J Ranch?	[]
Other	16	1	It sure is, Phillip. But I do believe this steer I'm riding has the farts.	['farts']
Other	16	0	Oh, look who's coming! Isn't that Mohammad, the holy prophet of the Muslim religion?	[]
Other	6	0	Hey guys, how's it going?	[]
Other	11	0	Hello Mohammad, we've read all aboat you in the Koran.	[]
Other	7	0	I'm here to investigate a murder.	[]
Other	10	1	ALL RIGHT, JUST WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE??!!	['hell']
Other	11	0	You censored out the image of Mohammad in our television special!!	[]
Other	17	0	Ey! You guys know the rules! Nobody can show the image of Mohammad anymore. It's dangerous.	[]
Other	6	0	But you ruined the whole show!	[]
Other	30	0	Look, I'm not gonna risk the lives of the people at this network. Let's just forget aboat it, okay guys?  Aw, come on guys, give me a break.	[]
Other	13	0	We demand you rerun Mystery at the Lazy J Ranch with Mohammad uncensored!	[]
Other	33	0	Ey! I run this network, not you guys! And if you ask me, your show has become so preachy and full of messages that you've forgotten how to be funny! NO Mohammad!	[]
Other	14	0	But Family Guy is going to show Mohammad on an episode that airs tonight!	[]
Other	24	0	I doubt it! I'll bet that right now, somebody is on their way to FOX Network to demand that that episode be pulled.	[]
Cartman	14	0	Ma'am, I need to speak to the president of this network right away.	[]
Other	4	0	What is it regarding?	[]
Cartman	36	0	It's regarding Family Guy. I demand that the Mohammad episode be pulled before it airs tonight! It's incendiary, it's offensive to Muslims, and people can get hurt! It's wrong! It's WROOONG!	[]
Other	37	0	O...kay, but if you've got a problem with Family Guy, you'll have to wait in line.  That little boy over there has an appointment to try and get Family Guy off the air altogether.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Dude, can I go before you?	[]
Other	3	0	Eat my shorts!	[]
Kyle	17	1	What the hell is going on?  Hello?  Excuse me, I need to get to Los Angeles.  Hello?!	['hell']
Other	40	0	...starting in a small town in central Colorado. The idea has now spread all over America.  Muslims continue to riot in the Middle East, demanding that Family Guy not air tonight's episode.  Amd Muslim terrorists continue to make threats.	[]
Other	15	0	Family Guy better not show Mohammad tonight. I'm serious. Family Guy isn't funny.	[]
Other	7	0	Osama bin Laden had this to say:	[]
Other	28	1	If you look closely at the writing in Family Guy, you will see that the jokes never derive from the plot, and I think that's totally gay.	['gay']
Other	23	0	Bin Laden went on to say that if Family Guy shows the image of Mohammad as planned, the terrorist retaliation will be immediate.	[]
Other	4	0	You one of them?	[]
Kyle	1	0	Who?	[]
Other	9	0	How come your head ain't in the sand?	[]
Cartman	9	0	So... you don't like Family Guy either, huh?	[]
Other	4	0	I hate Family Guy.	[]
Cartman	21	0	So what's your plan? You're gonna ask the president of the network nicely to take it off the air?	[]
Other	2	0	Not nicely.	[]
Cartman	30	0	Look, kid, if you hate a TV show, all you have to do is get an episode pulled. Pretty soon the show is compromised and it goes off the air.	[]
Other	2	0	Cool, man.	[]
Cartman	37	0	Yes. So my plan is to use this whole Mohammad thing as a way to scare the network into pulling tonight's show. I'm going to use fear to get them to do what I want.	[]
Other	5	0	Isn't that like, terrorism?	[]
Cartman	9	0	...No, it isn't like terrorism. It IS terrorism.	[]
Other	4	0	I could do that.	[]
Cartman	13	0	This is manipulation at its highest lever; you should let me handle this.	[]
Other	6	0	I'm a pretty bad kid.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Really? What's the worst thing you've ever done?	[]
Other	8	0	I stole the head off a statue once.	[]
Cartman	32	0	Wow, that's pretty hardcore. Geez. That's like this one time, when I didn't like a kid, so I ground his parents up into chili and fed it to him.	[]
Other	7	0	You got it, man. You got it.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Seeya.	[]
Other	27	0	I want to assure the American people that as President, I have exhausted every possible solution. Unfortunately, Mohammad will appear uncensored on Family Guy tonight at seven.	[]
Other	2	0	Mr. President!	[]
Other	23	0	Mr. President, can't the writers of the show be reasoned with? Don't they know they're putting the country in danger?	[]
Other	27	0	I have come to... understand something about the Family Guy writing staff. Suffice it to say that they will not be persuaded by the possibility of violence.	[]
Other	2	0	Mr. President!	[]
Other	13	0	What exactly did you learn about the Family Guy writing staff, Mr. President?	[]
Other	7	0	I'm afraid that information is classified.	[]
Other	3	0	AWWW!!!  Mr. President!	[]
Other	17	0	Mr. President, can't you force the Family Guy writing staff not to write anything about Mohammad?	[]
Other	7	0	Couldn't you throw them in prison?	[]
Other	20	0	Look! The fact of the matter is the Family Guy writing staff is protected by something called the First Amendment!	[]
Other	9	0	And what exactly is this First Amendment, Mr. President?	[]
Other	8	0	Uh you know, the right to free speech.	[]
Other	1	0	AWWW!!!	[]
Other	21	0	Mr. President, when your administration came up with this First Amendment, did it not foresee a problem like this might happen?	[]
Other	15	0	Well... We didn't come up with the First Amendment. It was already in place.	[]
Other	12	0	What do you intend to do about this First Amendment, Mr. President?	[]
Other	16	0	Forgive me, Mr. President, but this First Amendment sounds like a lot of bureaucratic jibbery-joob?	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Other	3	0	That's right!	[]
Other	7	0	Okay, let's discuss the fall lineup.	[]
Other	21	0	Sir, there's still one little boy out here who wants to speak with you about pulling the Family Guy episode	[]
Other	8	0	All right, let's get this over with.	[]
Cartman	35	0	Hello, gentlemen, ladies. My name is little Danny Pocket. And I won't take much of your time. Please excuse my tiny crutch; it's the only way I can get around these days. Ow...	[]
Other	3	0	Oh, poor kid.	[]
Cartman	92	0	You see, my father worked for a newspaper in my native country of Denmark. His newspaper showed an image of Mohammad and, two days later, terrorists suicides bombed his building. I was in the lobby when it happened.  First one terrorist suicide bombed us and, then dozens more. They just kept coming. Suicide bombers running in the building and blowing up one after another! They were like Mexican jumping beans. I just don't wanna see people here at your studio getting hurt, because... that would be, of course, your responsibility.  Ow..	[]
Other	24	0	I feel terrible. It's so east to put terrorism out of mind until one of its victims is staring you in the face.	[]
Other	16	0	Sir, if we pull the episode, the Family Guy writing staff will refuse to work again.	[]
Other	32	0	Little boy, will you talk to the Family Guy writing staff? If your story touches their hearts like it has ours, perhaps they'll back down from demanding we air the episode.	[]
Cartman	7	0	I'll certainly do my best.  Ow.	[]
Other	28	0	Take this noble child over to the Family Guy offices. If he can scare them like he has us, maybe we can pull the Mohammad episode after all.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Yes, and then Family Guy is as good as dead.	[]
Other	3	0	What was that?	[]
Cartman	9	0	I I said thank you. Thank you for listening.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Thanks a lot for the ride.	[]
Other	29	0	Ey, it's the least I could do. I hope you succeed, kid. I really don't wanna see Family Guy go off the air. I love that show!	[]
Kyle	6	0	I'll do everything I can.	[]
Other	31	1	I mean, I know it's just joke after joke, but I like that. At least it doesn't get all preachy and up its own ass with messages, you know?	['ass']
Kyle	13	0	Excuse me.  Do you know which way the network president's office is?	[]
Other	4	0	Who wants to know?!	[]
Kyle	18	2	Look, my fat bastard friend is trying to trick the network into getting Family Guy off the air.	['fat', 'bastard']
Other	8	0	The network president's office is in there!	[]
Kyle	3	0	Oh thanks, dude.	[]
Other	3	0	No problem, man.	[]
Kyle	8	0	Hello? This can't be right, I-  Ow!	[]
Other	2	1	Cowabunga, motherfucker!	['motherfucker']
Other	2	0	Hello Mitchell.	[]
Other	4	0	Oh hi, Miss Travis.	[]
Other	16	0	The president has asked that little Danny Pocket here speak with the Family Guy writing staff.	[]
Other	12	0	Are you... sure? They're working on a new episode right now.	[]
Cartman	7	0	It won't take long, sir.  Ow...	[]
Other	24	0	All right, I'll take him back. Follow me, little Danny.  You must be excited. Not many people get to meet our writing staff.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Yes, I'm totally excited. Family Guy is so funny.	[]
Other	10	0	Well, here we are. Danny, the Family Guy writing staff.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Wha?  What are they?	[]
Other	21	0	They're manatees.  Gretchen and Flubber are from the Gulf of Mexico. Tinker, Pete and Lucy are from the Caribbean Sea.	[]
Cartman	13	0	Family Guy is written by manatees?  Of course, it all makes sense now.	[]
Other	106	2	They really are brilliant creatures.  You see, the right side of the tank is filled with idea balls.  Each ball has a verb, noun, or pop culture reference written on it. There's millions of them.  The manatees choose an idea ball and swim it over to the joke combine on the other side of the tank.  Uh there goes Gretchen! She's comin' up with an idea. Oh, she came up with Gary Coleman.  The idea balls drop into the joke combine and form part of the new script.  Laundry Date Winning Mexico Gary Coleman. A perfect Family Guy joke! I can see it now!	['balls', 'balls']
Other	8	0	Peter, you didn't do the laundry today.	[]
Other	17	0	You think that's bad? Remember the time I won a date to Mexico with Gary Coleman?	[]
Other	3	0	Que pasa, senores?	[]
Other	4	0	Whatchoo talkin' 'bout, Willis?	[]
Cartman	14	0	Waitwaitaminute waitaminute. These... manatees demanded that Mohammad be shown? How? Manatees don't talk!	[]
Other	88	0	When FOX censored the image of Mohammad last week, it also meant that the Mohammad ball had to come out of the idea tank. It made the manatees very upset. Pull just one idea ball out of the idea tank, and the manatees stop working. He-here, I'll show you.  Keith?  All right all right, put it back in!  Manatees are very ethical writers. Either everything's okay to write about, or nothing is. Anyway, the president of the network wanted you to ...speak with the manatees.	[]
Cartman	38	0	Oh... yes, yes. Um  hello, manatees. I, I think you should allow the network to pull your episode with Mohammad. See, I'm the victim of a, a terrorist attack and... terrorists might come after you if you-	[]
Other	7	0	That isn't gonna work on them.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Why not?	[]
Other	19	0	Don't you know anything about manatees? They're the only mammals that are completely unmoved by terrorst threats.	[]
Cartman	4	1	Son of a bitch.	['bitch']
Kyle	11	0	Let me out of here, kid! Why are you doing this?	[]
Cartman	3	0	Well well well!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Cartman!	[]
Cartman	16	0	Hello, Kyle. Looks like you've run into a little snag in your plan as well.	[]
Kyle	6	2	You fat sun of a bitch!	['fat', 'bitch']
Cartman	29	0	You came so close to stopping me, didn't you, Kyle. There was just one thing you didn't count on: that more people besides me hate Family Guy.	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Kyle	21	0	Well, a lot of people like Family Guy too! Who are you to decide it shouldn't be on the air?!	[]
Other	20	1	Shut up!  You shut your fucking face, man!  Did it work? Did you scare the network into pulling the episode?	['fucking']
Cartman	38	0	Not yet! But I've come up with a new plan. I've learned how to make the Family Guy writing staff stop working! As soon as everyone goes on their lunch break, I can sneak back in.	[]
Other	2	0	Cool man!	[]
Kyle	8	0	Cartman, let me out of this stupid net!!	[]
Cartman	50	1	Good, Kyle! That's good anger you're showin' there! See that?! That's emotional character development based on what's happening in the storyline! Not at all like Family Guy. Now, if you'll excuse me, Kyle,  I've got some idea balls to remove from a manatee tank.	['balls']
Kyle	1	0	WHAT?!	[]
Other	10	0	I don't understand it. What's wrong with them?	[]
Other	10	0	We don't know, Mr. President. They just stopped working.	[]
Other	12	1	But, nobody took any idea balls out of the tank, did they?	['balls']
Other	6	0	No sir, none of us did.	[]
Other	24	0	Then why are they refusing to write? I agreed to show Mohammad uncensored! I did what you asked! WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME??!!	[]
Cartman	77	0	Sir! Sir!  If you don't my saying, I think you asked for this. You gave in to the manatees last week. Now they know all they have to do is refuse to work and they can get whatever they want. You spoiled them by caving in. Now they thnk they can walk all over you.  Sir, you are in charge of this network, not them. Maybe it's time you showed them who's in charge.	[]
Other	51	0	You're right. It's time I stop letting these primadonna manatees tell me what to do! I'm pulling the Mohammad episode, you got that?! And if you all don't want to work tomorrow, you can just find other jobs!!  How long before Family Guy's supposed to air?!	[]
Other	3	0	Twenty-five minutes.	[]
Other	3	0	I gotta hurry!	[]
Cartman	6	0	I did it. I... AM... GOD!!!	[]
Cartman	15	0	Family Guy is going off the air! No more Family Guy for me, mon frere!	[]
Kyle	4	1	Cartman!!  You fucking fatass!	['fucking']
Cartman	7	1	How the hell did you get out?	['hell']
Kyle	23	0	That kid and I had a long talk! I told him he was on a slippery slope to becoming a monster like you!	[]
Cartman	15	2	Aw, God damnit, you gave him one of your gay little speeches, didn't you?!	['damnit', 'gay']
Kyle	6	0	You are NOT KILLING FAMILY GUY!!	[]
Cartman	21	0	You're too late, Kyle! The president of the network is pulling the episode! Family Guy is as good as dead!	[]
Kyle	14	1	There's still time to tell the network president you're full of CRAP!	['crap']
Cartman	7	0	I can't let you do that!	[]
Kyle	11	1	Get out of my way or I'll kick your ass!	['ass']
Cartman	27	0	Fine, Kyle. I guess it was inevitable.  Let this be our final battle.  Ow. OW! Stop it! Kyle, that's too hard! Ah!  Ugh. Kyle! Stop it!	[]
Kyle	3	0	Ow. Quit it!	[]
Cartman	6	0	Ow. Quit it, Kyle! Bleh. Kyle!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Stop it!	[]
Kyle	3	0	Ow. Quit it!	[]
Cartman	46	0	Ow. Quit it, Kyle! Leh- Kyle! Let go- Okay okay come on, time out. Kyle, time out! Time out! Time out.  Time in!  I d-ow! Uh. Ah. Sh-gah. Okay. Okay. Time out! Kyle t-time out! Time out! Time out! Time out! Time out!	[]
Kyle	4	0	No more timeouts, fatass!	[]
Cartman	9	0	Time out! Time out! Time out, Kyle! Ay! Ay!	[]
Cartman	56	3	Kyle! Kyle! Get the... Get the- Kyle! Kyle, dude, that was- that was in the balls! Dude, serious- seriously! That was in the balls! No hitting- No hitting in the balls!  Kyle!  Quit it, Kyle. Give it up, Kyle!  Okay... Okay! Okay okay!  You win! You win. I give up.  Hahaha! I had my fingers crossed.	['balls', 'balls', 'balls']
Kyle	2	0	Thanks, kid.	[]
Other	13	0	Network Control! This is the President! I want you to pull the episode.	[]
Other	6	0	What?  Mr. President, are you sure?	[]
Other	10	0	I'm sure. Begin episode jettison sequence 0 2 900.	[]
Other	3	0	Abort System initiated.	[]
Other	2	0	Awaiting confirmation.	[]
Other	8	0	Mr. President, we need your final approval code.	[]
Other	6	0	President approval code  0-0-destruct-	[]
Kyle	5	0	Sir! Mister television executive! Stop!	[]
Other	3	0	Who are you?	[]
Kyle	36	1	Listen to me: the little boy who convinced you to pull the episode is a bastard child. He only wants you to pull it because he knows it will be the end of Family Guy forever!	['bastard']
Other	5	0	The end of Family Guy?	[]
Other	6	0	Mr. President, we need final authorization!	[]
Other	9	0	Hold on, Julie!  What are you talking about, kid?	[]
Kyle	35	0	Pulling an episode because someone is offended starts a chain reaction. You'll have to pull more and more episodes until the show goes off the air completely. It's what happened to Laverne & Shirley.	[]
Other	11	0	You mean... the manatees aren't trying to run the network?	[]
Kyle	2	0	What manatees??!!	[]
Cartman	9	0	Go ahead, Mr. President! Continue what you were doing!	[]
Kyle	8	0	No! You have to show Mohammad, Mr. President!	[]
Other	7	0	Mr. President, we're awaiting your orders!	[]
Kyle	11	0	Sir, just think about what you're doing to free speech!	[]
Cartman	9	0	No! Think about the people who could get hurt!	[]
Other	9	0	Ah... I don't know who to listen to!	[]
Cartman	13	0	Okay, I'll make it easy for you.  Pull the Mohammad episode, now!	[]
Other	7	0	Okay, I'll listen to you.  Julie?	[]
Kyle	22	0	Noo! Wait! You can't listen to him! He's a lying deceitful monster who only wants Family Guy off the air!	[]
Other	5	0	But he has a gun.	[]
Kyle	17	0	You can't do what he wants just because he's the one threatening you with violence!	[]
Cartman	3	0	Shut up, Kyle!	[]
Other	11	0	I can't be responsible for people getting hurt. Especially me.	[]
Kyle	28	0	Yes, people can get hurt. That's how terrorism works. But if you give into that, Doug, you're allowing terrorism to work. Do the right thing here.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Give the orders to pull the episode, Mr. President!	[]
Other	17	0	I shouldn't even be in the office still. It's supposed to be half-day Friday.	[]
Other	13	0	Mr. President, thirty seconds to airtime. What do you want us to do?!	[]
Kyle	6	0	Do the right thing, Mr. President.	[]
Other	17	0	How about I allow the episode to air but, just censor out the image of Mohammad again.	[]
Kyle	21	0	I wish that was good enough, but if you censor out Mohammad, then soon you'll have to censor out more.	[]
Cartman	4	1	No gay speeches, Kyle!	['gay']
Kyle	33	0	If you don't show Mohammad, then you've made a distinction what is okay to poke fun at, and what isn't. Either it's all okay, or none of it is.	[]
Other	4	0	Five seconds, Mr. President!	[]
Kyle	10	0	Do the right thing. Show Mohammad.  Do. The right. Thing.	[]
Other	7	0	Mr. President, we need a decision now!	[]
Other	8	0	Family Guy goes on air as planned. Uncensored.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Yes!	[]
Cartman	6	0	No! No, I hate Family Guy!!	[]
Other	2	0	Air it!	[]
Other	8	0	Peter! You got a pink slip at work?	[]
Other	19	0	You think that's bad? Remember the time I got a salmon helmet from Mohammad while wearing a toga?	[]
Other	2	0	Coming Mohammad.	[]
Other	5	0	Wow, a salmon helmet! Thanks!	[]
Other	6	0	Anyway, what were we talking about?	[]
Other	5	0	Oh yeah, my pink slip.	[]
Other	15	0	Hey, that wasn't bad at all. They just showed Mohammad standin' there, lookin' normal.	[]
Other	6	0	Mr. President, the terrorists are retaliating!	[]
Other	1	0	What?!	[]
Other	4	0	Or the time I-	[]
Other	15	0	As soon as the image of Mohammad appeared, terrorist leader al-Zawahri announced the retaliation!	[]
Other	21	0	We warned you not to show Mohammad- But Family Guy did it anyways. So now, here is our retaliation on America!!!	[]
Other	4	0	Hello, I am American.	[]
Other	4	0	I'm American too.	[]
Other	7	1	We like to crap own each other.	['crap']
Other	13	1	Hello, I am the President Bush. I will crap on both of you.	['crap']
Other	5	1	Ugh! We love to crap!	['crap']
Other	14	0	I'm American. I'm pregnant with a baby, but I'm not married.	[]
Other	3	1	Let's crap.	['crap']
Jesus	16	1	Look at me! I'm Jesus! Would you like me to crap on you, Mr. Bush?	['crap']
Other	4	1	Mmm, yummy yummy crap.	['crap']
Other	14	0	Oh yeah, take THAT! We burned you! THAT WAS WAY FUNNIER THAN FAMILY GUY.	[]
