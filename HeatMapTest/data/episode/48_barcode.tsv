Mr. Mackey	52	3	Well, now, uh, what's he supposed to think, Mr. Garrison? I mean, uh, look at all the media, all the magazine ads and television ads talkin' about sexual molestation, m'kay? He sees all that and assumes you didn't molest him because of some flaw in his looks or personality.	['sexual', 'molestation', 'molest']
Other	9	0	I didn't do it because it's wrong!	[]
Mr. Mackey	35	0	I know, I know, but I'm afraid this problem has run very deep through Mr. Garrison's mental state. I'm worried that if... you don't do something, well it could kill him.	[]

Other	12	1	Alright. Would you have sex with your son to save his life?	['sex']
Other	11	0	...Oh, this is one of them Scruples questions, ain't it?	[]
Other	19	1	Nono, I got a better one: Would you have sex with your mother... to save your father's life?	['sex']
Other	2	0	Wooo, yeah.	[]
Other	25	1	Oh, like if someone had a gun to your father's head and said, Have sex with your mother or else I'll shoot him?	['sex']

Other	6	0	He could have a knife, though.	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Other	1	0	Sure.	[]
Other	3	0	Yeah, a knife.	[]
Other	35	3	If a killer put a knife to my throat, and said, Have sex with your father or else I'm gonna kill your mother while having sex with you, ...I would have sex with myself.	['sex', 'sex', 'sex']

It's been just under 20 hours since everyone on Earth pooped their pants, and people still roam their damaged homes with disbelief, and loss. Rick?	[]
Other	58	2	Alan, I'm standing at ground zero. Here, the damage is greater than anywhere.  Like the rest of the world, everyone here has crapped their pants. Some  crapped themselves to death. And still others ...ruined perfectly good pairs of pants. A nation mourns and tries to rebuild, but the big question that remains is, How did this happen?	['crapped', 'crapped']
Other	19	1	Well, I see. Other than making everyone in the world crap their pants, our event went over really well.	['crap']
