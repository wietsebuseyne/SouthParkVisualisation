Kenny	3	0	(Are you serious?!)	[]
Cartman	1	0	Yep!	[]
Kyle	8	0	That's only a vaccination for girls, stupid!	[]
Cartman	16	1	Then why are they sayin' that gettin' vaccinated at school is gonna make us all retarded?	['retarded']
Kyle	12	0	Because some people think vaccinations can give you autism or Asperger's!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Wait what?	[]
Kyle	10	0	That's what they're talking about on the news!	[]
Cartman	7	0	Wait, there's a disease called Assburgers?	[]

Kyle	11	0	You wanna bet?  Let's go ask my Dad right now!	[]
Cartman	5	1	Okay, you're on, Jew!	['jew']
Mr. Garrison	25	0	And so children, at noon today, all the girls will go to the gymnasium for their vaccinations, and boys will head on out to recess.	[]
Butters	10	1	Do the girls get their shots right in the vagina?	['vagina']
Mr. Garrison	8	0	No. Butters, that's not how it works.	[]
Other	9	0	Mr. Garrison,  these three boys were caught playing hooky.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Did you guys know there's actually a disease called Assburgers?	[]
Mr. Garrison	17	1	Sit down boys, we'll talk about this later. Right now we're talking about vaginal warts.	['vaginal']
Wendy	12	0	This isn't fair! How can the school make us get vaccinated?	[]
Butters	8	2	You mean little hamburgers grow in your butthole?	['hamburgers', 'butthole']
Cartman	8	1	That's right, it's a butt fungus.	['butt']
Butters	11	1	Well I don't want burgers comin' out of my butt!	['butt']
Stan	9	1	God, shut up! Everyone just shut the fuck up!	['fuck']
Mr. Mackey	100	1	M'kay, Stan, you, you've gotta try and pull yourself out of this, m'kay? I know that... your parents recently got divorced. M'kay, that's gotta be hard. I know that's... that's bad. But when you walk around all mopey, m'kay, and sayin' everything is... just shitty, well, that's called bein' a Debbie Downer, Stan. And nobody likes a Debbie Downer, m'kay. ...I mean you've gotta, you've gotta snap out of it, Debbie. Come on, Debbie, you're even bummin' me out now, m'kay? Your attitude just- just sucks.	['shitty']
Stan	12	0	I just want everything to go back to the way it was.	[]
Mr. Mackey	19	0	Okay, well, that's not gonna happen, Debbie. Okay, you know, uh life, life has to change, m'kay?	[]
Stan	23	0	How?... When all the things that made you laugh, just make you sick. How do you go on when nothing makes you happy?	[]
Mr. Mackey	33	0	Huh... e-excuse me a minute, Stan. m'kay?  Uh, hi, Ms. Bronski? Did we vaccinate Stan for the flu last year? We did? Uh oh... I think he's got Asperger's.	[]
Other	12	1	This is breaking news, from CNN! Or Fox or, whatever.  Fuck you.	['fuck']
Other	39	0	The first documented case of a child developing Asperger's Syndrome from school vaccinations  has put the government in a tight spot.  At a press conference today the media heard from the young boy's father, Steamy Ray Vaughn.	[]
Randy	55	1	It's pretty shitty when you work so hard to be a great parent, and then the government comes along and with one shot turns your child into a mentally incapacitated freak! I mean look at him. He's disinterested, depressed, self-loathing. It's most likely the reason his mother and I got divorced!	['shitty']
Other	23	0	In response to the embarrassment, the President of the United States has passed Stan's Bill, putting an end to school-mandated vaccinations.	[]
Other	6	0	Mr. President, the bill is ready.	[]
Other	6	0	Just sign right here, Mr. President.	[]
Other	12	0	Aaand if you could just sign this one as well, Mr. President.	[]
Other	24	0	It is yet unknown if any other children have contracted from the vaccinations, but if so, multimillion-dollar lawsuits are probably not far behind.	[]
Cartman	17	0	Turn on your heart light. Let it shine wherever you go. Let it make a happy glow-	[]
Other	6	0	Eric, what is it this time?	[]
Cartman	12	0	Fever... Light... lightheadedness... I don't know what's wrong with me.	[]
Other	5	0	You don't feel warm.	[]
Cartman	27	0	Oh, that's a relief. I thought maybe I had a fever but I- oh OH. Oh my buns! There's a sharp pain in my buns!	[]
Other	6	0	Can you lay on your stomach?	[]
Cartman	7	0	I-I'll try. I'll try.	[]
Other	7	0	What the?  What is this? A hamburger?	[]
Cartman	2	0	A what??	[]
Other	7	1	Why are there hamburgers in your underwear?	['hamburgers']
Cartman	16	0	Are you serious? How can there be-  Oh my God! You're saying I have assburgers??	[]
Other	16	0	This doesn't make sense. Are you trying to sneak food into the school or something?	[]
Cartman	17	0	What are you talking about?? I got vaccinated from the school, and now clearly I have Assburgers!	[]
Other	2	0	Very funny!	[]
Cartman	17	0	Well I'm glad you think Assburgers is funny! Just note my condition on your records there!	[]
Other	5	0	Get out of my office!	[]
Wendy	10	0	Hey Kyle?  Have you heard anything at all from Stan?	[]
Kyle	25	0	I've tried, Wendy. I've called him, I've been to his house. But since his diagnosis, all he's done is gotten worse.	[]
Wendy	15	0	I don't know what to do. It's like he's... completely turned off.	[]
Other	10	0	Those two should just screw and get it over with!	[]
Other	1	0	Yeaahh...	[]
Kyle	33	1	I can't keep doing it, Wendy. I know he has an illness, but goddamn, it uh, it's like being around a black hole that just sucks the life out of everything.	['goddamn']
Wendy	20	0	Look, maybe what we should do is all go over to his house together, an-and that way we could-	[]
Kyle	34	0	NO. I can't, Wendy.  All his negativity is starting to make me depressed. I have to let him go.  And whatever happens next, I'm going to embrace with a totally  positive attitude.	[]
Cartman	6	2	Godamned stupid school nurse! Heartless bitch!	['godamned', 'bitch']
Kyle	5	0	What's the matter dude?	[]
Cartman	14	1	I spent all morning making hamburgers for nothing! That's what's the matter!	['hamburgers']
Kyle	19	1	You made hamburgers? Well that's awesome! I'd love one.  Mmm. Hm, wow  This is really good, Cartman.	['hamburgers']
Cartman	1	0	Really?	[]
Kyle	10	0	Yeah.  Hey Riley! Try this hamburger.  Cartman made them himself.	[]
Other	4	0	Wow. What is that?	[]
Kyle	8	0	Seriously, Cartman. You could make money with these!	[]
Cartman	3	0	Gee, thanks Kyle!	[]
Other	31	0	The truth is we still know very little about Asperger's syndrome, Mrs. Marsh. All our patients here show the same social awkwardness that your son exhibits.  Good morning Mr. Mathers.	[]
Other	2	0	Goodbye, doctor	[]
Other	33	0	It's as if they all have an inability to distinguish from what is socially acceptable and what is not.  We've got a new patient, Martin. I want you to meet Stan.	[]
Other	4	0	Nice to meet you.	[]
Other	58	0	Here at the treatment center, our focus is on awareness.  Asperger's is serious, but unfortunately because of its name people think it's a disease to be made fun of.  Alright everyone, let's have a seat.  Oh uh, we'll be done at about 5 pm, Mrs. Marsh. I'll call if it's any earlier.	[]
Other	10	0	Oh, right, uh. Good bye, Stan. I-I love you.	[]
Other	4	0	Alright, are we clear?	[]
Other	3	0	We're clear!	[]
Other	45	0	Watch that window, Puck!  Everyone, make sure this room isn't bugged!  Alright Stan, listen up! We don't have a lot of time! You've been told Asperger's is real! It isn't! It's just a front we use to stay hidden!	[]
Stan	7	0	Wait, it's not a real illness?	[]
Other	47	0	Of course not! If there was a social development disease, you wouldn't call it Asperger's! That's just, that's just mean!  There's a big war going on out there, Stan, and we want you to join our fight to bring it all down!	[]
Stan	8	0	Uh, nooo nonono, we're not doing this!	[]
Other	46	2	You've broken through their reality and they don't like it! Others deserve to know the truth! You see everything as shit, don't you?!  Where other people see fun movies and hear cool music, all you see and hear is shit! Am I right?	['shit', 'shit']
Stan	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Other	12	0	So do we. All of us here. We know the truth too.	[]
Other	15	0	We found a way to make it stop, Stan. Now are you interested? Or not?	[]
Cartman	11	0	Next order, please! Get your Cartman Burgers here, fresh and flavorful.	[]
Clyde	9	0	I just can't believe how yummy these are.	[]
Cartman	9	0	There you go, Molly, and a bag of chips.	[]
Other	1	0	Thanks!	[]
Cartman	8	1	How are we doing on those patties, Jew?	['jew']
Kyle	4	0	About three minutes, fatass!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Nice!	[]
Butters	12	0	Jeez, we're out of finished burgers again, Eric. We need more.	[]
Cartman	17	0	It's alright. I think another batch is just finishing off in our top-secret flavor enhancer.	[]
Kyle	22	0	Dude, come on Cartman. As employees, don't you think we should get to see what the final secret flavor enhancer is?	[]
Cartman	40	1	I'm sorry Kyle, but if we compromise our final cooking process, then our patented flavor will be everywhere, and we'll have to go back to school. Now, let me get those hamburgers.  Alright, these are good to go!	['hamburgers']
Other	8	0	Alright, is he ready to be sent in?	[]
Other	7	0	He's ready! Beta levels are normal.	[]
Stan	4	0	Who are you people?	[]
Other	32	1	We are the Secret Society of Cynics.  Everything looks like shit to you, right? What if I were to tell you... that you're seeing the world the way it actually is?	['shit']
Stan	1	0	Huh?	[]
Other	25	1	The world around us has all completely turned to shit. But aliens are putting out a brainwave that keeps most people seeing a false reality	['shit']
Stan	1	0	Aliens?	[]
Other	20	0	Or, robots from the future, whatever. The point is they need to keep everyone in a blissful state of ignorance.	[]
Other	20	1	Yeah. Everything used to be awesome and cool, but now everything's gone to shit and nobody knows except us!	['shit']
Other	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Stan	3	0	Because of aliens?	[]
Other	48	1	Or genetically altered humans, whatever, fuck you! All that matters is that you are the key to bringing this whole thing down. They know who we are, but they won't be expecting you! Are you ready to go back into the illusionary world you once lived in?	['fuck']
Stan	4	0	Yeah I'm ready!	[]
Other	7	0	Let's send him in!  Drink this.	[]
Stan	3	0	Ahhhh!  Oh coool!	[]
Other	8	0	Jill, you got a date with Al Pacino?	[]
Other	11	0	I think Al Pacino wants to play Twister with your sister.	[]
Stan	4	0	Adam Sandler's funny.	[]
Butters	6	0	Hey Kyle, you have a visitor.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Stan?	[]
Stan	1	0	Kyle!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Hey, Stan!	[]
Stan	22	2	Dude, I'm sorry. I've been a shitty friend. I miss my buddy. You were right: Adam Sandler is fuckin' hysterical!	['shitty', 'fuckin']
Kyle	4	0	Stan, are you alright?	[]
Stan	19	1	Yeah dude, I totally get it now. I can see how lame I was saying everything was, was shit.	['shit']
Kyle	6	0	Really? Uh, Stan, that's great.	[]
Stan	29	3	But Kyle, it's all shit! For real! It's all shit 'cause the aliens with AI and you and me are gonna fuck it all up! Come on!	['shit', 'shit', 'fuck']
Kyle	5	0	Dude. Have you been drinking?	[]
Stan	24	0	You're not listening to me, Kyle. Dude, we have to go do this one thing, and then everything can go back to normal!	[]
Kyle	21	0	It's too late for that. Things just can't go back, Stan, uh.  Ah-I'm with Cartman Burger now.	[]
Stan	10	2	...Dude, Cartman Burger? Seriously? How shitty- is that fuckin' concept?	['shitty', 'fuckin']
Kyle	14	0	See? There you go again. Look at you dude. Look what you've become.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Everything alright here, Kyle?	[]
Kyle	4	0	Yeah, it's fine.	[]
Cartman	10	0	We're uh gonna need some more patties pretty soon.	[]
Kyle	8	0	Yeah yeah, ahh I'll be right there.	[]
Stan	10	0	Come on, Kyle. This is about you and me, remember?!	[]
Kyle	20	0	Look, dude, things around here have changed. Sometimes, the only way to keep going is to make a left turn.	[]
Stan	25	4	Fuck you Kyle, you're a piece of shit!  ...Kyle, I love you.  You're a piece of shit though. Fuck you!  ...I love you.	['fuck', 'shit', 'shit', 'fuck']
Other	24	0	Big Harry and Mike in the Morning and in case you didn't catch last night's episode of , we're breakin' it down.	[]
Other	8	0	Oh Big Harry, when the  ran into the -	[]
Other	5	0	Nonono, no! How about when .	[]
Other	10	0	He's back!  Did you see the illusionary world again?	[]
Other	10	0	How does it feel to be back in the Matrix?	[]
Stan	5	1	I feel like total shit.	['shit']
Other	15	0	It's okay. That's just your brain levels adjusting back to the real world.	[]
Other	16	0	Try and focus, Stan: we've found them! We know where the rock creatures are now.	[]
Stan	3	0	The rock creatures?	[]
Other	8	1	Or aliens, or AI- things. Whatever, fuck you.	['fuck']
Stan	9	0	Dude, I canh- I... I can't do any...	[]
Other	4	0	He's gonna pop!	[]
Other	11	0	Come on kid, there's not a lot of time left.	[]
Other	6	0	You're pushin' him too hard!	[]
Stan	2	0	Ugh God.	[]
Other	20	0	Stan, you have to convince people they're living in a world of illusion. We're sending you back in!	[]
Other	29	0	We all know why we are here. There's a rebellion in our midst and it must be SQUASHED OUT!  We have to put an end, to Cartman Burgers.	[]
Other	7	0	Yes, yes, but what do we do?	[]
Other	10	0	At KFC we've seen a 50% drop in sales.	[]
Other	12	0	It's worse at Pizza Hut. Cartman Burgers choked out the market.	[]
Other	20	0	What makes them so good? For whatever reason, these Cartman Burgers satisfy the taste cravings from all of our restaurants!	[]
Other	24	0	There lies the secret.  It's the chemical compounds from all our flavors. Pizza Hut, Burger King, KFC, all somehow infused into one burger.	[]
Other	42	0	It's as if he's somehow taking all the ingredients of our food, breaking them down into some kind of... gas. And them somehow... infusing that gas into his hamburger. What kind of instrument could he be using to do this?	[]
Other	11	0	It would have to be some sort of super Dutch oven.	[]
Other	12	0	But a Dutch oven with greater technology than we've ever seen.	[]
Stan	1	0	Aughah.	[]
Other	12	0	Hey! Wake up. Come on now, wake up!  Use the smelling salts!	[]
Stan	1	0	...Enchirito?	[]
Other	4	0	You know the secret?	[]
Stan	5	0	What? You guys are aliens?	[]
Other	14	0	Stop playing with us! What's the secret behind Cartman Burger's amazing taste?!	[]
Stan	5	0	Dude, I don't know!	[]
Other	16	0	He's lying!  You see this kid in the picture? This guy is his best friend.	[]
Other	2	0	Ah ha!	[]
Stan	6	0	I'm not friends with him.	[]
Other	7	0	They've been through everything together. Inseparable.	[]
Stan	8	0	No, no, we don't hang out anymore.	[]
Other	13	0	Oho right, like someone would just walk away from a friendship like that?	[]
Stan	21	1	Dude, I didn't walk away! I turned 10 and everything he wanted to do seemed shitty to me, so I-!	['shitty']
Other	29	0	Oh sure! Anyone would ditch out on their best friend 'cause they weren't feeling good! Now stop playing games and tell us why Cartman Burgers is so delicious!	[]
Stan	4	0	I don't know!	[]
Other	14	0	Alright, I guess we're going to have to do this the hard way.	[]
Kyle	7	0	There, ten mediums and five medium-rares.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Alright, I'll take these to the flavor enhancer.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Next please.  Oh, hey.	[]
Stan	11	0	Kyle, you've gotta tell me the secret to Cartman Burger.	[]
Kyle	4	0	What are you doing?	[]
Stan	8	0	How do you guys make them so yummy?	[]
Kyle	4	0	I don't know.	[]
Other	22	0	You'd BETTER get him to tell you or you're getting shot in the back of the head!  You got that?!	[]
Stan	9	0	Dude, just tell me the secret to Cartman Burger	[]
Kyle	16	0	Why?! So that we can lose our business and everything can go back to old times?!	[]
Stan	11	0	No, because there's aliens with a sniper-chicken on me.	[]
Kyle	24	0	Oh God! Look, I know you got Asperger's from the school and I I'm sorry. But your negativity is poison to me!	[]
Other	17	0	Oh, right. Like a friend would walk out on somebody who was diagnosed with a serious illness!	[]
Stan	17	0	Dude, I'm sorry that I've been bumming you out, but it's not my fault!	[]
Kyle	8	1	You said fuck you to my face, Stan.	['fuck']
Stan	9	0	Dude, I didn't realize what I was saying.	[]
Other	17	0	Oh yeah, like any friend would say something that severe and then try to take it back.	[]
Kyle	23	0	Alright, look. I honestly don't know the secret, dude. Only Cartman does, and that's how it's gonna work for us.	[]
Other	29	1	Goddamnit this is getting us nowhere!  Everyone get back! Do you wanna play hardball?! That's fine!  All right, let's see this mighty machine once and for all!	['goddamnit']
Other	5	1	You vampire sons of bitches!	['bitches']
Other	1	0	Haha!	[]
Other	16	0	Alright, nice work Stan. Now comes the final step! You have to take out Duck President!	[]
Stan	10	1	Just stop it! You people are so full of shit!	['shit']
Other	16	0	Uh oh, looks like the serum is wearing off!  Here, you'd better take some more!	[]
Stan	6	0	No, I'm done with that!	[]
Other	27	0	But Stan, you have to take down the bad guys and go through a personal transformation, so that everything can go back to the way it was!	[]
Stan	147	0	I don't want everything to go back to the way it was!  I, I don't.  You were right, Kyle. Sometimes, the only way to go forward, is to take a big left turn. I've been resisting it, but I'm ready now. I want you to stay with Cartman Burger, dude. It's okay. You're gonna do this and I'm gonna do my thing and ...my mom and dad aren't getting back together. But you know what? It's okay. In fact, it's better. Change is gonna bring new things to all of us. Where will Cartman Burger go from here? That'll be cool to see. And it opens me up to a whole new adventure, exploring... new relationships with all new people in town.  Maybe this kid will become my new best friend.  Or maybe this kid will.	[]
Other	1	0	Wow.	[]
Stan	41	0	Maybe it won't be like before, but... at least it'll all be new. And that's what's gonna make it so that I can keep going. For the first time in a long time, I'm really excited.	[]
Randy	16	0	Stan? Stan! Get in the car, Stan! Your mom and I are movin' back in together!	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Randy	6	0	We worked it out, pal. Surprise!	[]
Stan	5	0	No, dad, no. No, please!	[]
Other	20	0	We talked a lot and, we know it's what's best for you kids and, I don't know...	[]
Stan	9	0	No, Mom, sometimes you've got- a left turn.	[]
Other	23	0	People get older, Stanley. And as you get older you realize... the best thing to do is just... stick with what you know.	[]
Kyle	8	1	You were sticking these in your ass, Cartman?!	['ass']
Other	1	0	Eeewww!	[]
Other	3	0	I like that!	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Other	26	0	Big Harry and Mike in the Morning, talkin' about Two and a Half Men. I think Ashton Kutcher makes it the show to be seen, Mike.	[]
Other	13	0	Yeah, but what about that movie Dolphin Tale? I am psyched for that!	[]
Other	20	0	Dolphin Tale, Big Harry and Mike in the Morning.  Let's hear one from the band Slamjammer and their song-	[]
Kyle	9	0	Dude, we're gonna see the new Zoopeeker movie!	[]
Cartman	4	0	The Zookeeper 2: Zookeepier!	[]
Stan	2	0	...K, coming.	[]
