Kyle	4	0	Who's Middle Park?	[]
Cartman	3	0	What's homecoming?	[]
Chef	38	0	But just remember what I taught you. That football is like making love to a reeeeeally beautiful woman. You can't always score, but when you do, it makes all the trying worthwhile.  Now, let's start practice.	[]
Other	4	0	Uh, Mr. Chef sir?	[]
Chef	5	0	Yes Pip, what is it?	[]

Cartman	11	1	Wait a minute, why the hell does he get an A-?	['hell']
Mr. Garrison	31	0	Eric, Stanley just might lead our team to victory against the Middle Park Cowboys for the first time in decades. And we treat star athletes better 'cause they're better people.	[]
Cartman	4	0	That's not fair!	[]
Other	9	0	Life isn't fair kiddo, get used to it.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Stupid puppet.	[]

Stan	4	1	What's a - homosexual?	['homosexual']
Mr. Garrison	70	2	Hoh, well, Stanley, I guess you came to the right person. Sit down.  Stanley, gay people... well- gay people are evil. Evil right down to their cold black hearts, which pump not blood like yours and mine, but rather a thick, vomitous oil that oozes through their rotten veins and clots in their pea-sized brains which becomes the cause of their Naziesque patterns of violent behavior. Do you understand?	['gay', 'gay']
Stan	2	0	I guess.	[]
Mr. Garrison	23	1	Good, I'm glad we could have this little talk Stanley. Now you go outside and practice football like a good little heterosexual.	['heterosexual']
Cartman	12	1	You guys see me block that defense today, I was kicking ass.	['ass']
Kyle	14	1	You're gonna need to kick more ass than that to beat the Cowboys.	['ass']
Cartman	12	2	Hey, speaking of pounding ass, here comes Stan's little homo dog.	['ass', 'homo']
Stan	11	0	Shut up dude!  Sparky, where'd you get that pink scarf?	[]
Other	2	0	Bark, bark.	[]
Cartman	10	1	Man, that is the gayest dog I've ever seen.	['gayest']

Kyle	3	0	Did it work?	[]
Stan	4	0	I don't know.	[]

Stan	8	0	Come on you guys, I have an idea.	[]
Other	8	0	I want $500 on the South Park Cows.	[]
Other	3	0	Are you crazy?	[]
Other	29	0	No siree. I'm telling you, I got the line. My nephew Stan is the best quarterback the school has ever seen. I guarantee they'll beat the spread.	[]
Other	10	0	I want to put all my money on the Cows.	[]

Other	28	0	Not that sure. I think we better come up with a backup plan. Uhh, let's see here. Hey, bookie! Wha- what's the halftime show gonna be?	[]
Other	15	0	You haven't heard?! John Stamos' older brother Richard Stamos is gonna sing 'Loving You'.	[]
Other	4	0	I love that song.	[]

Kyle	1	0	Oolala	[]
Cartman	3	0	There he goes.	[]
Stan	13	1	Atta boy Spark, get her.  Yes!  Ah crap! Now what do I do?	['crap']
Kyle	13	1	Who cares if your dog is gay? Maybe it's not that bad.	['gay']
Cartman	19	1	No way dude, my mom says God hates gay people. That's why he smote those sodomies in France.	['gay']
Kenny	9	1	(I think that Garrison said that gay people suck.)	['gay']
Stan	16	1	I know Mr. Garrison said that homosexuals are evil, but, but Sparky doesn't seem evil.	['homosexuals']
Kyle	11	0	Well, maybe Mr. Garrison is wrong. You should ask somebody else.	[]
Stan	2	0	Like who?	[]
Other	12	0	And now back to Jesus and Pals on South Park public access.	[]
Jesus	34	0	Yea, many of you are seeking answers, and I am the way for you my children. Let's open the phone lines back up for some questions... Hello caller, you're on the air.	[]
Other	5	0	Yeah, is, is this Jesus?	[]

Other	36	0	Well, every, everything's much better Jesus. She hasn't mouthed off since. I just wanted to thank you for the advice. Oh, and for, for dying for my sins, that was really nice of you.	[]
Jesus	11	0	Blessed art thou, Robert. Next caller, you're on the air.	[]
Stan	16	1	Uh, hi, Jesus. I, I have a dog, and he's a- he's a homosexual.	['homosexual']
Jesus	29	1	My son, a lot of people have wondered what my stance on homosexuality is. So I'd like to state once and for all, my true opinion. You see-	['homosexuality']
Other	20	0	That's all the time we've left for Jesus and Pals, now stay tuned for Marty's Movie Reviews.	[]

Chef	51	0	Now children, we've got to handle the ball better. You got to hold your football like you hold your lover.  Gently, yet firmly. You wanna be both nurturing and clinging at the same time. Oh yeah!  Just like makin' sweet love to the football. Feelin' naughty with the football. Mmmm.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Uh, Chef?	[]

Chef	11	0	No Pip, we still don't have a helmet for you.	[]
Other	17	0	Righto, but how about I use a helmet today, and one of the other children goes without?	[]
Chef	13	0	That wouldn't be very fair to the other children, now would it?	[]
Other	5	0	No um, I guess not.	[]
Other	26	0	What we'll have to do here Carl is put a trigger on that bomb that makes it go off at a specific moment during halftime.	[]
Other	5	0	What moment would that be?	[]
Other	27	0	Well, John Stamos' older brother is all set to sing 'Loving You' during halftime. We want that bomb to go off when he hits that high F.	[]
Other	3	0	What high F?	[]
Other	17	0	You know, Loving you is easy 'cause you're beautiful doo-nn-doo-nn-doo-doo... Aaaaah	[]

Chef	8	0	What's the matter Stan, you seem down.	[]
Stan	11	1	I just, I can't concentrate 'cause my dog is gay.	['gay']
Chef	15	1	Well, you know what they say: you can't teach a gay dog straight tricks.	['gay']
Mr. Garrison	10	1	Oh, stop filling his head with that queer-loving propaganda.	['queer']
Chef	9	0	Say what?! You of all people should be sympathetic.	[]
Mr. Garrison	4	0	What do you mean?	[]
Chef	7	1	Well, you're gay aren't you?	['gay']
Mr. Garrison	12	2	What?! What the hell are you talking about?! I am not gay.	['hell', 'gay']
Chef	7	0	Well, you sure do act like it.	[]
Mr. Garrison	10	1	I just act that way to get chicks, dumb ass.	['ass']
Kyle	5	0	What's the matter dude?	[]
Stan	14	0	I don't know where Sparky is. He usually follows me to football practice.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Maybe he went shopping for some leather pants.  Ow!	[]
