Other	64	0	I am Mysterion. Though only nine years old, I dedicate my life to helping people - when I'm not in school.  For months now I've been protecting my town from crime. But now, something has happened that even I cannot fight alone.  The BP Oil Company has drilled and caused a spill in the Gulf like no other. The President of BP apologized.	[]
Other	3	0	We're sorry.	[]
Other	12	0	But they drilled again, and tore open a portal into another dimension.	[]
Other	3	0	We're sorry.	[]
Other	32	0	Creatures from that dimension are now wreaking havoc in the Gulf. BP tried to solve the problem by drilling on the moon, but instead they caused the dark lord Cthulhu to emerge.	[]
Other	1	0	Sorry.	[]
Other	49	0	I have joined forces with other superheroes in my neighborhood to help save the Gulf. But even the other heroes do not know that unlike them, I do have a power. A power they will now begin to understand. And all will know who and what I truly am!	[]
Other	7	0	Just terrific what you boys are doing.	[]
Other	4	0	Thank you, ma'am.	[]
Other	9	0	I'll take twenty lemon bars, you little rascals.	[]
Other	48	0	A terrific human interest story here, Tom. As America wonders what happened to Captain Hindsight, some Colorado kids are being a little superhuman themselves. They call themselves Coon and Friends, and they've been baking and selling lemon bars to help aid those affected in the Gulf crisis.	[]
Other	7	0	We believe that every little bit helps.	[]
Other	9	0	Their little super club consists of seven young heroes.	[]
Other	1	0	Toolshed!	[]
Other	3	0	The Human Kite!	[]
Other	1	0	Mysterion!	[]
Other	1	0	TupperWear!	[]
Other	1	0	Mosquito!	[]
Other	1	0	Timmah!	[]
Other	3	0	Mint Berry Crrrunch!	[]
Other	30	1	The boys stated that there used to also be a hero named The Coon actually in the group, but they let him go because he was being quote,  a dick.	['dick']
Other	14	0	Mysterion, if Cartman's gone, why are we still calling ourselves Coon and Friends?	[]
Other	13	0	Because it pisses Cartman off beyond belief, and I find that  extremely funny.	[]
Other	55	0	Passengers waiting for flight 73 to New Orleans, we thank you for your patience, but the conditions in the Gulf are still delaying our departure. Unfortunately, we've just been informed that the dark lord Cthulhu has shat on the runway at the New Orleans airport, and we'll be delayed at least another hour.	[]
Other	1	0	Awwww!	[]
Other	19	0	Come on, people! Some of us need to get to New Orleans NOW!  Yes yes, I am the Coon.	[]
Other	7	0	The Coon? I've heard of that.	[]
Other	2	0	Ya have?	[]
Other	17	0	I saw on TV. That superhero group that's helping with the Gulf spill. Coon and Friends.	[]
Other	15	0	Actually, I'm no longer with Coon and Friends. I work on my own now.	[]
Other	6	0	Can I ask you a question?	[]
Other	3	0	Yes, of course.	[]
Other	10	0	Do you know Mint-Berry Crunch? What's he like?	[]
Other	50	1	The evil girl villain fought with all her might, but the Coon was too much for her. As people looked on and cheered for the Coon, he clawed and punched the villain's stupid fat face!  This fight would not be the last the Coon fought. Next stop: New Orleans!	['fat']
Other	12	0	That's almost it, superheroes. We're about out of lemon bars.	[]
Other	14	0	Well then, perhaps we should return to our secret base and bake some more!	[]
Other	1	0	Timmah!	[]
Other	6	0	I'll take ten lemon bars.	[]
Other	3	0	Ten. Yes sir!	[]
Other	7	0	That's definitely the last of them.	[]
Other	7	0	You'll never stop him, you know.	[]
Other	2	0	Stop who?	[]
Other	41	0	The Great One.  Cthulhu. He has risen, and soon all will be under his rule. It has all been foretold in the Necronomicon.  Hail Cthulhu! The darkness of the mythos is finally here.  Oh man, these are really good lemon bars.	[]
Other	2	0	The Necronomicon?	[]
Other	4	0	What's a mythos?	[]
Other	12	0	I don't know, but I think we'd better find out.	[]
Other	8	0	All right, superheroes. Back to our secret base!	[]
Other	3	0	Mint-Berry Crrunch!	[]
Other	3	1	What the hell?!	['hell']
Other	8	0	I knew it! Cartman tore our base up!	[]
Other	2	0	Not Cartman.	[]
Other	7	0	What do you mean Not Cartman, dude?	[]
Other	10	0	Whoever did this to our base was looking for something.	[]
Other	13	0	Don't anybody move!  So you're the superheroes trying to blackmail me!	[]
Other	6	0	Aw, dude, it's Captain Hindsight.	[]
Other	113	0	Captain Hindsight,  the hero of the modern age. Once a reporter for the National News, Jack Brolin always had a knack for hindsight.  Wanting to become the best-known reporter in the country, Jack tried an experiment to boost his hindsight levels. But then a freakish accident occurred when a retroactive spider got into the equipment. The reporter's hindsight was blasted to superhuman levels!  For months he was able to use his new powers for good, fighting for peace, and the American way.  With his three trusty companions, Shoulda, Coulda, and Woulda.  But now, the Hindsight that has saved so many threatens to consume Jack's very soul. It's Captaiiin Hindsight!	[]
Other	16	0	I shoulda never mixed vodka and Jack Daniels. I shoulda just gone to bed last night!	[]
Other	5	0	Um dude, are you okay?	[]
Other	13	0	Where are the pictures?! Give every copy of the pictures to me NOW!	[]
Other	12	0	P-p-please sir, w-we don't know what you mean.	[]
Other	10	1	You got pictures of me having sex with Courtney Love!	['sex']
Other	2	0	Uhhh ohhh...	[]
Other	7	0	Chaos! Why did you take those pictures?!	[]
Other	33	0	But uh, but, but the Coon said if I took the pictures he, he'd let me go home and, and I've missed four days of school now 'cause I've been-	[]
Other	6	0	Alright enough! What's going on?!	[]
Other	13	0	Hindsight, that isn't Courtney Love! Our former member, the Coon, tricked you!	[]
Other	5	0	It's not Courtney Love?	[]
Other	6	0	Please sir, put down the gun.	[]
Other	14	0	No! What if I put down the gun and realize I shouldn't have?!	[]
Other	15	0	Look dude, we don't need to play Superhero anymore. We can just go home.	[]
Other	10	0	NO! Because I could realize I shoulda killed you all!	[]
Other	25	1	Then do it!  Pull the trigger, Hindsight! If you don't believe us then you don't have a choice! Pull the trigger, you pussy!	['pussy']
Other	5	0	Dude, Kenny, ch-chill out.	[]
Other	9	1	You guys go! I'll deal with this prick!	['prick']
Other	10	0	Wuh uh okay, if you insist. Uh see ya, Kenny.	[]
Other	13	0	My mom did tell me I had to be home by five, I-	[]
Other	7	0	I said it's fine! Just go!	[]
Other	13	0	Uh, text me later, Kenny, if you wanna, like, play basketball or somethin'.	[]
Other	168	4	Cthulhu! Cthulhu, dude! Over here!  Hey Cthulhu. 'Sup? Yes, it is me, the Coon! But don't worry, I'm actually not here to fight you! We are not so different, Cthulhu. Though I am a superhero and you are a dark god from another dimension, perhaps, we can work together!  I know how it feels to want to take over and rule the earth and have everyone else be your slaves. I do, bro! But there's a group of superhumans who are going to stop at nothing to stop YOU!  Good, I have your attention. The superhumans I speak of are right now working on plans to destroy you! They reside in Colorado and they are fucking assholes, and they all deserve to be sent into a dark oblivion! You can do that, right? Send people into a dark oblivion? 'Cause that's what those buttholes deserve!  No-Dude! Dude, Colorado is that way! Where are you going??  Goddammit, why don't dark lords fuckin' listen?!	['fucking', 'assholes', 'goddammit', 'fuckin']
Other	53	0	It doesn't matter.  Even if the pictures are fake. I can't take it anymore.  Do you have any idea what a curse it is to have perfect 20/20 hindsight?  As soon as something bad happens, I immediately know how it could have been avoided. I can't take it anymore!	[]
Other	11	0	People need you, Hindsight!  Without you they feel helpless and stupid.	[]
Other	9	0	Well I don't want the power anymore, alright?!	[]
Other	30	1	You think your power's a curse?! Let me tell you something about curses, buttlicker!  Because there's some superpowers that make yours look like nothing! Trust me, I know.	['buttlicker']
Other	5	0	Wha-? What is your power?	[]
Other	88	2	I can't die.  I've experienced death, countless times. Sometimes I see a bright light. Sometimes I see heaven. Or hell. But eventually, no matter what, I wake up in my bed, wearing my same old clothes.  And the worst part? Nobody even remembers me dying. I go to school the next day, and everyone is just like, Oh hey Kenny. Even if they had seen me get decapitated with their own eyes.  You wanna whine about curses, Hindsight? You're talking to the wrong fucking cowboy.	['hell', 'fucking']
Other	12	0	And now, a special announcement from the president of BP and DP.	[]
Other	68	0	Hello, I'm Tony Hayward. The tragic spill in the Gulf is a disaster that should have never happened. And as head of the oil company responsible, I would like to say, what should I do?  Should I admit we've made mistakes?  Should I remind you we've done this before? What should I do? Should I find newer and better ways to say I'm sorry?	[]
Other	12	0	Should I really believe I ruined my legacy?  What should I do?	[]
Other	4	0	What should I do?	[]
Other	16	0	What should I do?  Should I forget about the past and not care about my powers?	[]
Other	11	0	Or should I tell you, I am not a role model.	[]
Other	5	0	Seriously, what should I do?	[]
Other	8	0	Should I accept my role as the villain?	[]
Other	5	0	Maybe I should just... disappear.	[]
Other	19	0	Should I not have listened to my technicians who said a spill wouldn't happen? They're my technicians!	[]
Other	7	1	Hindsight's a bitch, isn't it?	['bitch']
Other	27	1	Should I just apologize to my friends and ask them to take me back? Tell then that I was being a selfish jerk?  What should I do?	['jerk']
Other	19	0	Should I get back in the chair? Remove my powers and just go back to being a simple reporter?	[]
Other	30	2	Should I admit I was wrong? Ask for everyone's forgiveness and go back to my original team?  Nah, screw that. I'm just gonna keep bein' a fuckin' dick!	['fuckin', 'dick']
Other	14	0	All right, superheroes, we've got to find out more about this Necronomicon thing!	[]
Other	2	0	Right, Toolshed!	[]
Other	20	0	Here we go: The Necronomicon contains an account of the Old Ones, their history, and the means for summoning them.	[]
Other	14	0	It is used by cults around the world, most notably the Cult of Cthulhu.	[]
Other	15	0	Aha! That's the cult the creepy man talked about, heroes. Uh, you okay, Mysterion?	[]
Other	3	0	I'm fine.	[]
Other	15	0	Ten arrested in South Park for cultish activity. This is from like, ten years ago.	[]
Other	11	0	So these people have been waiting for Cthulhu a long time.	[]
Other	10	0	Hey wait a minute. Dude. Mysterion, it's your parents.	[]
Other	15	2	Uhh, what?  What the fuck?! I m-I mean,  Uh, I mean, what the fuck?!	['fuck', 'fuck']
Other	17	0	Clyde? Clyde, I told you this morning to take the garbage out.  Clyde, do you hear me?	[]
Other	10	0	Okay Mom, just give me two minutes.  Nag nag nag.	[]
Other	117	0	Convincing a giant creature from another dimension to do what you want is no easy task. After days of killing and conquering, Cthulhu is at rest. Now is my chance to make a move. Perhaps last time I was too forceful with the dark god. Too demanding. To get what it wants, sometimes a coon must be on the attack and vicious.  But sometimes a coon must be cuddly and cute.  Time for me to try and manipulate the most evil thing in all the universe.  Who's the sleepy little man?  My name is the Little Coon. What is your name?  Craaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!  You're a sleepy man ne, Cthulhu?  Who's a needs a tummy rub?	[]
Other	6	1	You're hoggin' it all, asshole!	['asshole']
Other	8	1	'Cause I paid for it, you stupid bitch!	['bitch']
Other	15	0	You paid for it with the money I made washing dishes at the Olive Garden!	[]
Other	6	0	I told you to shut up!	[]
Other	18	1	Give to me, you prick!  AH! AAAAH!  Oh God he's back! It's that mystery kid again!	['prick']
Other	35	1	Uh what the hell do you want this time? Hey look, w-we did what you told us! W-w-we treat our kids better and we don't beat each other up as much.	['hell']
Other	12	0	And we gave our sons allowances and stopped gettin' high every night.	[]
Other	6	0	I'm not here about that.	[]
Other	6	0	Oh. Uhuh, sss-so now what?	[]
Other	13	0	Ten years ago you were arrested for being in some kind of cult.	[]
Other	2	0	We were?	[]
Other	8	0	We've been arrested lots of times, Mysterio.	[]
Other	7	0	Mysterion. What is the Cult of Cthulhu?!	[]
Other	25	0	Oh, that thing. Nooo, we weren't in that stupid group. They just used to offer free beer at their meetings, so we would go.	[]
Other	5	0	What happened at those meetings?	[]
Other	24	0	Trust us, we don't remember. Uh uh, I know it sounds hard to believe, but we were actually really drunk the entire time.	[]
Other	10	0	I don't find that hard to believe at all.	[]
Other	19	0	I swear, we haven't been back to their meetings ever since, even though we always still get invited.	[]
Other	5	0	These people still meet? Where?	[]
Other	8	0	Where they always did. Jim McElroy's house.	[]
Other	17	0	They used to meet every Friday night. I think they still do.  Did that really just happen?	[]
Other	5	0	I don't think so.	[]
Other	35	0	Breaking news here in the Gulf, Tom. The dark ancient god Cthulhu has called for a press conference, The Old One told reporters in a statement released this morning that it has extremely exciting news.	[]
Other	101	0	Ladies and Gentlemen, today we are pleased to announce the successful merger of Cthulhu, and the Coon. Cthulhu's track record for complete dominance and interdimensionary rule is without question. And now, coupled with the legitimacy and instantly recognizable brand name of The Coon, we intend to bring change and fight injustice. As the all-new Coon and Friends. And anybody else using that name for their benefit is breaking the law! Oh, what's that? There is another group using our trademarked name? Well, I guess we have a right to banish them to a dark oblivion, don't we?!	[]
Other	10	0	ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn.	[]
Other	34	0	The Old One has awakened!  A lot of us have waited a long time for this day. Well for all our South Park Cthulhu members old and new, it is time to par-tay!	[]
Other	10	0	There must be clubs like this all over the world.	[]
Other	19	0	We know some of these people. There's Mr. Adler, from shop class. And those two geeky computer guys.	[]
Other	12	0	Oh my God, look! Back row. Aren't those the Goth kids?	[]
Other	16	0	I'm so freaking stoked that Cthulhu is gonna squash all the happy-go-lucky conformists.	[]
Other	13	1	Yeah. I just hope he puts an end to the fucking Disney Channel.	['fucking']
Other	8	0	Dude, why would the Goth kids worship Cthulhu?	[]
Other	13	0	Makes sense. Unrelenting despair and a thousand years of darkness sounds pretty goth.	[]
Other	19	0	Now let us read from the Necronomicon. That is not dead which can eternal lie, and with strange aeons	[]
Other	4	0	Even Death may die.	[]
Other	13	0	In strange aeons even Death may die? What does that mean, Human Kite?	[]
Other	13	0	I'm not sure, Toolshed. Could it be a riddle, Mysterion? M-! Mysterion?	[]
Other	4	0	Mysterion is sooo... mysterious.	[]
Other	40	0	A horrific scene of destruction, despair and terror here in New Orleans. And still there's no sign of Captain Hindsight. Rumor has it he got sick of it all, went back to his chair, and removed all his powers.	[]
Other	6	0	Where are you Captain Hindsight? Aggh!	[]
Other	10	0	Perhaps... he shouldn't have gotten back in that chair...	[]
Other	14	0	Do you think the dark lord Cthulhu is gonna make us go to school?	[]
Other	9	0	No, assmunch. Cthulhu just wants chaos, bedlam, and madness.	[]
Other	23	0	Good, because if I have to go to PE class again, I was gonna kill myself.  Who the F'n H is that?	[]
Other	12	0	What does it mean? That is not dead which can eternal lie?	[]
Other	8	0	And with strange aeons even Death may die.	[]
Other	4	0	What does it mean?!	[]
Other	33	0	It means Cthulhu is gonna get rid of all the posers and make everything cool and black and stuff. It's gonna be like, a Nine Inch Nails concert that goes on forever.	[]
Other	13	0	Yeah, so go home and put your underwear back inside your pants, poser.	[]
Other	9	0	You're going to tell me everything you know!	[]
Other	24	0	Nobody's stopping Cthulhu now! All will be sadness. Life will become death, and I will watch the crimson blood leak from your neck.	[]
Other	7	0	Dude, that little kid is hardcore goth.	[]
Other	2	0	Hardcore goth.	[]
Other	26	0	The child is right, you know. Cthulhu sees all, hears all. The dark lord wants us to dispense of this one, kids. Give us a hand.	[]
Other	8	0	Whaaat? Dude, I don't wanna kill anybody.	[]
