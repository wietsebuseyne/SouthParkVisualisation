Clyde	9	0	I don't know, that looks pretty high up.	[]
Butters	10	0	Yeah. I think it'd be better to start lower.	[]
Stan	10	0	Dude, I really don't think it's smart, Cartman.	[]
Cartman	8	0	This is gonna be totally cool, you guys.	[]
Stan	10	0	It's not gonna work; just come down from there.	[]
Cartman	9	0	...Jeez, this looks a lot higher from up here.	[]
Kyle	4	0	What's going on?	[]
Stan	9	0	Cartman thinks he can fly off of his roof.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Do it! Do it!	[]
Cartman	3	0	I'm gonna!	[]
Craig	7	0	I wouldn't if I were you.	[]
Token	7	0	Those wings don't look very strong.	[]
Kyle	20	0	Don't listen to 'em, Cartman! I'm sure it'll work. Go for it. Yaaay, Cartman! Fly, fly, fly!	[]
Cartman	23	0	Okay, here we go.  Since the days of Copernicus, man has dreamed of flight. On this historic day, let us go on to-	[]
Kyle	7	0	Awww, go on and do it already!	[]
Cartman	25	0	Hold on, I'm givin' my speech! On this historic day, we remember the Wright Brothers: Orville and Redenbacher, whose dreams and visions inspired generations.	[]
Stan	6	0	He's not gonna do it.	[]
Cartman	26	0	And now, again, one man's vision ushers in a new era of aerial travel, proving the power of imagination and intellect. The magic... of flight!	[]
Other	15	0	Oh my God! Eric! Eric,  Mommy's here. Sweetie?  Oh, what's wrong with him?	[]
Other	35	0	I'm afraid that your son is... incredibly stupid. He thought he could fly with cardboard wings. The stupidity is so severe that it caused a fall, which has... put him into a deep coma.	[]
Other	7	0	Coma... My God, fo- for how long?	[]
Other	16	0	There's no telling. He may never recover. We'll just have to wait. And see.	[]
Other	14	0	Seasons change, time passes by. As the weeks become the months become the years.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Eugh...	[]
Other	6	0	Oh my- Doctor!  He's awake!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Wheh? Where am I?	[]
Other	10	0	Oh, you've finally come back! It's a miracle!	[]
Other	15	0	You're at the hospital, Eric. You've been in a coma for some time.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Coma... How long?	[]
Other	13	0	It's been two... days. Nurse, you can remove his face-warmer now.	[]
Other	2	0	Yes, Doctor.	[]
Other	22	0	Now, Eric, you've suffered massive head trauma. Your road to recovery will be long and arduous. At least another two days.	[]
Other	14	0	Seasons change, time passes by.  As the weeks become the months become the years.	[]
Other	7	0	You're doing so much better, muffin.	[]
Cartman	16	2	Why the hell do I have to share my room with other patients?! This is bullcrap!	['hell', 'bullcrap']
Other	10	0	Oh, you're sounding just like your old self again.	[]
Other	10	0	I'm sorry, detectives, there was nothing we could do.	[]
Other	35	1	Damnit! Another murder victim! For three years the Left-Hand killer has been at large and I've exhausted every lead! Maybe... I just don't have what it takes to be a cop anymore.	['damnit']
Other	9	0	We'd better get back to the station, sir.	[]
Cartman	11	1	Good, because you assholes have kept me up for three hours!	['assholes']
Other	17	0	All right, let's go, Murphy. Hang on a second, where are, where are my car keys?	[]
Cartman	6	0	Probably in your front pocket, dumbass!	[]
Other	10	0	Doctor, didn't you say that kid suffered head trauma?	[]
Other	5	0	Yes, it was pretty severe.	[]
Other	4	0	What is it, Lou?	[]
Other	14	0	I've... heard cases where people suffering head trauma awaken to some psychic abilities.	[]
Other	4	0	Aw, come on, sir.	[]
Other	25	0	I know it's ridiculous,  but I'm gonna explore every possibility I can!  Hello, young man, could we have a quick word with you?	[]
Cartman	13	0	Not now! The nurse is gonna walk in any minute with my lunch.	[]
Other	5	0	Twelve-thirty, Eric. Lunch time.	[]
Other	14	0	Young man, how did you know the nurse was gonna walk in just now?	[]
Cartman	15	0	I don't know, I just knew it.  Aww man, this smells like meatloaf. Again?!	[]
Other	3	0	Yep, meatloaf again.	[]
Other	4	0	Jesus, how did he...?	[]
Other	32	1	Little boy...  Well it's a snowball's chance in hell but...  we were wondering if you could come down and see if your... new powers could help us catch the killer.	['hell']
Other	3	0	His new... powers?	[]
Other	13	0	All right, make sure you get pictures of everything in this crime scene.	[]
Other	4	0	Who's the kid?	[]
Other	9	0	He's supposed to be some kind of psychic.	[]
Other	2	0	Aw, Christ!	[]
Other	15	0	This is... where the body was found.  Multiple stab wounds, just like all the others.	[]
Cartman	8	0	How come the outline is missing its hand?	[]
Other	17	0	The killer always cuts off the left hand of his victim, and keeps it as a trophy.	[]
Other	16	0	Stand back, give him room!  Come on, kid, concentrate! What do you see in your mind?	[]
Cartman	36	0	Ice cream. Covered with... chocolate sprinkles...  Double-Stuff Oreos...  He ... He's taking the top of one and...  ...and he puts it together to make Quadruple-Stuffs!  I see...ice cream, and sprinkles, and Quadruple-Stuffs!	[]
Other	2	0	Jesus Christ!	[]
Other	1	0	Sir?	[]
Other	9	0	Tom Johansen, the owner of the ice cream shop!	[]
Other	4	0	Yes? Oh, hello, detectives.	[]
Other	10	0	Mr. Johansen, could we have a quick word with you?	[]
Other	20	0	Sure, come on in!  I'm afraid the house is a little bit of a disaster area since I have-	[]
Other	6	0	Get him!  Code 6! Code 6!	[]
Other	6	0	Use the taser! Use the taser!	[]
Other	3	0	Do it again!	[]
Other	12	1	He put up a hell of a fight, but we got him!	['hell']
Other	2	0	Why?! Why?!	[]
Other	12	0	Congratulations, Eric. You just stopped the biggest killer in South Park history.	[]
Other	22	0	We would give you a reward, but I guess that knowing the people of South Park are safe again is reward enough.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Guess again.	[]
Other	7	0	All right, here's a hundred dollars.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Wow!	[]
Other	19	0	His powers are uncanny. Take good care of him, Ms. Cartman. Make sure he uses his powers... for good.	[]
Other	12	0	Oh, he will. My little poopsiekins is a very good little boy.	[]
Cartman	17	0	I'm a psychic and you are worse. I have super-awesome powers and you don't.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Cartman, what did you do?!	[]
Cartman	23	0	Oh, didn't you hear, Kyle? I used my new psychic abilities to catch the serial killer. And I made a hundred bucks!	[]
Kyle	17	0	Nice old Mr. Johansen runs a candy shop! He wasn't a killer and you know it!	[]
Cartman	14	0	Then why did I see ice cream and cookies when I closed my eyes?	[]
Kyle	9	1	Because you're a fucking fatass, that's why!	['fucking']
Cartman	6	0	Do not doubt my powers, Kyle!	[]
Kyle	6	0	You don't have any powers!	[]
Cartman	17	0	Don't make me do it, Kyle! I can make your head explode with a single thought!	[]
Butters	4	0	Wuh be careful, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	5	1	He can't do crap!	['crap']
Cartman	8	0	Fine, Kyle! You asked for it! Hee-at!	[]
Other	12	0	There he is! Hey, Eric! Eric!  We've got a little problem.	[]
Cartman	1	0	What?	[]
Other	13	0	While the ice-cream store owner was in jail, another murder was committed.	[]
Other	16	0	This body also had a missing hand and a bowl of corn flakes next to it!	[]
Other	6	0	Which can only mean one thing!	[]
Kyle	3	0	Ha! You see?!	[]
Other	20	0	That a copycat killer is on the loose! We need your psychic abilities to catch this new guy right away!	[]
Kyle	1	0	What?!	[]
Other	19	0	We'll pay you up front this time! We've gotta catch this new guy before he kills again.	[]
Cartman	23	0	I'm afraid that my powers... are not for sale. ...And by that I mean they absolutely are for sale. Let's go!	[]
Other	33	0	Tom, I'm standing in a meadow just outside of town, where police have discovered the first victim of the serial copycat killer. Child wunderkind Eric Cartman is now arriving on the scene.	[]
Kyle	4	1	This is fuckin' ridiculous!	['fuckin']
Other	7	0	Whattaya got, wunderkind? Are ya seeing anything?	[]
Cartman	2	0	No. Nothing.	[]
Other	6	0	Maybe his powers have left him.	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Cartman	24	0	Wait a minute.  Fried chicken! It's tender and it's fresh!  There's maple syrup... Maple syrup's being put on the chicken!	[]
Kyle	8	1	What the hell is wrong with these people?!	['hell']
Other	20	0	They're never gonna catch the serial killer. He's too smart. Do you want to see my cotton panties?	[]
Kyle	5	0	Hey! What about this guy?!	[]
Other	6	0	Quiet! He's havin' a vision!	[]
Cartman	13	0	It is fried chicken!  Oh my God. It's a fried chicken sundae.	[]
Other	22	1	Junior, what are you doing out? I'm sorry, Mother. You come home right now and have sex with me! No, Mommy!	['sex']
Kyle	9	0	Hey, uh, does anyone know who that guy is?!	[]
Other	17	0	I said quiet, you little brat, or I'll have you arrested for interfering with the law!	[]
Other	12	0	This is Park County News 4, with your host, Jim Brown-ish	[]
Other	66	0	The copycat killer of the cut-off-the-left-hand killer has been arrested. Police used the help of Eric Cartman, a wunderkind psychic detective. At the crime scene, the young psychic had visions flash before his mind, and the police immediately arrested the owner of Kentucky Fried Chicken. The young man's visions were so astounding that other police departments have sought out his help.	[]
Cartman	26	0	If I'm happy and I know it, clap my hands. *clap* *clap* If I'm happy and I know it, clap my hands. *clap* *clap*	[]
Other	11	0	Eric, sweetie, there's um, some people here to see you.	[]
Cartman	17	0	More people need to make use of my phenomenal gifts, huh? Ahhh, it's so very tiring.	[]
Other	12	0	Ah, no, these people claim that they are the real psychic detectives.	[]
Other	13	0	So, you are the little boy who's been taking all our work?!	[]
Other	7	0	Oooh, I'll go make some tea.	[]
Other	22	0	Kid, we have a problem. You didn't go through the proper channels to become a psychic detective like we all did.	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Proper channels?	[]
Other	30	0	You were supposed to fill out the form on the back of the comic book and pay the twenty five dollar fee for the degree from the Psychic Detective School.	[]
Cartman	19	0	I was given my gift from a tragic accident. I didn't need to go to Psychic Detective School.	[]
Other	21	0	Well you just can't say you're a psychic detective, you have to use the ad in the comic book!	[]
Other	16	0	You must pay the twenty five dollar fee and give us ten percent of your earnings!	[]
Cartman	6	1	Ten percent, my balls, get lost!	['balls']
Other	9	0	Very well, then you give us no choice. Roger?	[]
Other	3	0	All right, everyone!	[]
Other	6	0	Oh, goodness! What's going on?	[]
Cartman	11	0	Stand back, mother! We're having a telekinetic battle of minds!	[]
Other	5	0	O-o-o-o-oh!	[]
Other	17	0	Enough!  We are ...obviously quite evenly matched. I guess this will have to be settled in court.	[]
Cartman	2	0	In court?	[]
Other	16	0	We brought a class-action lawsuit against you! We'll see you before the judge tomorrow!	[]
Other	3	0	Is it over?	[]
Other	24	0	Her name is... Veronica Crabtree, bus driver for the elementary school. She was considered an ancillary character, one the fans wouldn't miss much.	[]
Other	5	0	Jesus Christ! Cause of death?	[]
Other	13	0	Same M.O., sir. Multiple stab wounds, left hand cut off and missing.	[]
Other	43	0	So you're telling me somebody new is now copying the crimes of the copycat killer?! Jesus! Where will it end?!  Every time I put a killer behind bars, another guy just steps in and takes his place! What am I doing wrong?!	[]
Kyle	65	1	Excuse me, sir? I think I know who did this. We saw this guy at the last crime scene, and, and you know how serial killers sometimes return to the scene of the crime? Well, I followed this guy to his house, and when he left again, I collected some fingerprints and did a blood-sample analysis.  I'm pretty sure he's your man.	['analysis']
Other	7	0	How do you know?! Are you psychic?!	[]
Kyle	1	0	No.	[]
Other	58	1	Look, kid, don't waste my time with your blood-sampling fingerprinty hocus-pocus! I have to find this new killer now! I owe it to that victim over there! I know she hadn't been in any recent episodes, but dammit she deserved better than this! Come on, Murph, we've gotta talk to Eric Cartman again!	['dammit']
Kyle	7	0	Why won't anybody listen to me?!	[]
Kenny	6	0	(Don't take it personally, Kyle.)	[]
Kyle	48	1	I am taking it personally because Cartman is a retard! Just because he hit his head and went into a coma doesn't mean he's a- Wait, that's it. If I want people to listen to me, I just have to be as stupid as Cartman.	['retard']
Stan	11	0	Dude, I really don't think that's a good idea!	[]
Token	6	0	There has to be another way!	[]
Kyle	9	0	Be sure to take me to the same hospital!	[]
Butters	24	0	Now Kyle, don't fly too close to the sun, or it'll burn your wings, an- and you'll crash into the ocean.	[]
Stan	2	1	Butters, Goddammit.	['goddammit']
Kyle	24	0	All right, here we go.  Since the days of Copernicus, man has dreamed of flight. On this historic day we remem- aw, screw it!	[]
Stan	3	0	Call an ambulance.	[]
Other	54	0	Multiple arrests were made today for the murder of Hillary Neals. Police raided the South Park Motel 6 at 4 a.m., where seven psychic detectives were staying.  The psychic detectives' horrible crime was found out by psychic detective Eric Cartman,  who is now the only psychic not behind bars. What an amazing coincidence.	[]
Cartman	13	0	Cool.  Ah, Kyle is at the door. Come in, Kyle!  Who are you?	[]
Other	16	0	You. You give everyone else credit for my work, because you fail to see my greatness.	[]
Cartman	2	0	... 'Kay. Sweet.	[]
Other	10	0	Because of you, nobody knows the extent of my deeds.	[]
Cartman	19	0	Oh yeah. Awesome. Hold on, just a second.  Mom, there's some homeless guy here. Make him go away.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Hey. Hey, what's goin' on?!	[]
Other	9	0	You are obviously a big fan of my work.	[]
Cartman	7	0	I don't even know you dude!	[]
Other	16	0	But I am the serial killer! The one whose rightful place in history you have smirched!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Oh, Jesus.	[]
Other	13	0	And now you will have a place of honor, as my nineteenth victim.	[]
Cartman	16	0	No! No, you don't wanna kill me. Please, I'll give you anything you want!	[]
Other	41	0	Before you die, let me show you the things that I've done, so you will understand the breadth of my transformation!  This... is me at the grand canyon.  Do you see? This is me at Mount Rushmore  Do you see?	[]
Cartman	1	0	Heheh.	[]
Other	3	0	Do you see?!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Yes yes, I see!	[]
Other	20	0	Here I am at the Alamo in San Antonio.  This was just outside of the gift shop. Do you see?!	[]
Cartman	1	0	AAAAAAAH!	[]
Other	24	3	Dammit! Dammit all to hell! They just found another body! That means a fifth copycat killer is on the loose! Where's my psychic?!	['dammit', 'dammit', 'hell']
Other	18	0	Sorry, Sarge, the psychic's mom says her son hasn't been home for a couple of hours.	[]
Other	23	0	Sir! Dr. Kels just called from the hospital! He says another little boy just awoke from a coma, and is having psychic visions!	[]
Other	3	0	Let's go!	[]
Other	15	0	This is the young man here. He was in a coma for over sixteen hours.	[]
Other	14	0	Doctor, could you remove his face warmer? We'd like to speak with him.	[]
Other	3	0	Of course. Nurse?	[]
Other	14	0	Young man, the doctor said you've had some... visions about our newest murder?	[]
Kyle	46	0	I see... a man... with a baseball cap.  He's killing now... Oh! I'm seeing it all flash before my eyes! The guy's name is Michael Deets, and he lives at 621 Castillo Street. He's usually there between seven and eleven p.m.	[]
Other	5	0	What do you think, Mitch?	[]
Other	22	0	I don't know. How do we know this kid is really psychic? I mean, this boy is certainly no Eric Cartman.	[]
Other	20	0	All right, we'll check this Deets guy out. But let's use that one thing that we never use.	[]
Other	1	0	...Sir?	[]
Other	16	0	You know, what's that one thing that starts with an R that we never use?	[]
Other	1	0	...Restraint?	[]
Other	15	0	Yeah, yeah, restraint. We'll check this guy out, but let's use some restraint.	[]
Other	32	0	Look! Look at the things I've done! Here I am at Yellowstone National Park!  Do you see?! Here are pictures of my trip to Cheyenne for Frontier Days. Do you see?!	[]
Cartman	9	0	Oh, God! I'm so bored! Somebody help me!	[]
Other	23	0	Good evening, sir. We're Park County detectives. We were just wondering if we could take a quick look around your house, Misterrr...	[]
Other	1	0	God.	[]
Other	17	0	Well, Mr. God, it won't take but a second; it might help us with an investigation.	[]
Cartman	4	0	(Hey! Come over here!)	[]
Other	21	0	I see you like cutting the eyes out of photos of women. My son is a big fan of that, too.	[]
Other	3	0	Sarge! In here!	[]
Other	26	0	Jesus H.... That boy was right! Arrest that guy!  Whoa-whoa-wait-wait-hey-wait-wait-yo! Oh, wait a minute, no ah, I'm wrong.	[]
Other	1	0	Sir?	[]
Other	15	0	This isn't the guy. The serial killer always cuts off the victims' left hands.	[]
Other	1	0	Right.	[]
Other	22	0	Well those aren't left hands.  See, on your left hand, the thumb faces to the left. Those are all right hands.	[]
Other	1	0	Ohhh.	[]
Other	18	0	Nope, this isn't our man.  We're sorry, Mr. God. It appears we've wasted your time.	[]
Cartman	2	0	(Hey! Help!)	[]
Other	24	0	Heh, pretty amazing coincidence that guy had a bunch of hands on his wall. Heh, no wonder that boy thought he was a killer.	[]
Other	3	0	Yeah... Amazing coincidence...	[]
Other	2	0	Heh- sir?	[]
Other	16	0	Call it police intuition, but somethin' in there just didn't feel right.  Wait a minute.	[]
Other	4	0	Sarge...  What is it?	[]
Other	12	0	I'm not sure. I'm gonna have to run some tests.	[]
Other	11	0	Murphy, do you remember what I was supposed to be doing?	[]
Other	12	0	Oh. Uhhh... Oh. Something about hands, sir? Uh, for the serial killer?	[]
Other	5	0	Oh right! The hands! Right!	[]
Other	10	0	Oh my God. Murphy!  You're not gonna believe this.	[]
Other	9	0	That's it, no more pictures.  Time to die.	[]
Cartman	32	0	No, please! I'm sorry I gave other people credit for your killings. Ahah, it was, it was very wrong for me to lie about the other psychics and get them arrested.	[]
Other	8	0	Your hand will be one with the others.	[]
Cartman	39	0	Please just let me go! Ah, I'm gonna tell everyone I'm not really psychic! I've learned my lesson! Please, I don't wanna-  I don't wanna have to use my psychic mind missile on you!	[]
Other	5	0	Hold it right there, killer!	[]
Cartman	21	0	You got here just in time. He was gonna kill me because he was insanely jealous of my incredible psychic ability.	[]
Other	29	0	Well young man, you did an amazing thing. Not only did your psychic visions help us catch the killer, but a lot of innocent people are out of jail.	[]
Other	6	0	Yes, thank you very much, Kyle.	[]
Other	2	0	Yes, thanks.	[]
Other	8	0	You're certainly a better psychic then Eric.	[]
Kyle	37	0	No, don't you see? Cartman never had psychic visions. And neither do these people. The plain simple truth is that nobody is psychic. There's a logical explanation for every psychic story you've ever heard.	[]
Other	6	0	Do you think that's true?	[]
Other	37	0	It must be true. The kid is psychic.  But I don't suppose it really matters much. Because in the end, the way I caught the killer was with... good old-fashioned police work. Come on, Murphy.	[]
Other	12	0	Well young man, I guess that just leaves one score to settle.	[]
Cartman	5	0	You can't hurt me.	[]
Other	7	0	Then let this be our final battle!	[]
Kyle	12	0	Just stop it!  Stoop iiit!!  There's a logical explanation for that.	[]
