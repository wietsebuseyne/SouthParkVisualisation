Other	1	0	Really?	[]
Stan	43	0	When you grow up and you're a fourth grader, you'll understand that you have to be tough and direct with your parents. Go to your dad and tell him you wanna give up singing and dancing, and join the basketball team.	[]

Stan	23	0	You guys, this High School Musical thing isn't gonna go away. I think we'd better just get on board with it.	[]
Kyle	4	0	What? Are you crazy?	[]
Cartman	3	0	No way dude.	[]
Kyle	10	0	We promised each other we would never do that, remember?	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Yeah.)	[]
Stan	38	0	I know, but... I think we're really starting to become outcasts at school. We're losing all our credibility. I mean, look at who you guys are hanging out with now. Scott Malkinson, for Christ's sake.	[]
Other	9	0	What's so bad about hanging out with me?	[]
Cartman	18	0	Shut up, Scott Malkinson. I'm Scott Malkinson. I've got a lisp and I've got diabetes.	[]
Other	8	0	Hey, don't make fun of my diabetes!	[]
Cartman	11	0	Don't make fun of my diabetes, I'm Scott Malkinson.	[]
Stan	28	0	You can rip on him, but you guys are hanging out with him. Doesn't that make you think maybe your clout at school has slipped a little?	[]
Kyle	25	0	Stan, you're just jealous of that third grader and you think Wendy's gonna go for him unless you start singing and dancing too.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Yeah!)	[]
Stan	21	0	That isn't true!  Okay, that's totally true. But you guys, we are at risk of becoming the unpopular kids	[]

Kyle	15	0	We said we wouldn't be a part of this fad and look at you!	[]
Kenny	5	0	(Yeah, look at yourself, dude.)	[]
Stan	19	0	Look, you guys might be fine with being outcasts and hanging out with Scott Malkinson, but I'm not!	[]
Kyle	25	0	You know what? At least Scott Malkinson has some self-respect! At least Scott Malkinson doesn't cave into peer pressure and start doing musicals!	[]
Stan	15	0	Scott Malkinson has a lisp and diabetes! Nobody's gonna let him do a musical!	[]

Stan	77	0	Look, guys.  The world is changing. We can't fight it, we have to change with it. I've been watching these movies, and from the looks of it, there's gonna be a lot more singing and dancing when we get to high school.  And if you think we'll gain any respect by ignoring this thing and being individuals, then think about this: right now,  everyone thinks Butters is way cooler than any of you.	[]

'Cause you gotta do what you wanna do. Don't let nothin' get in your way, chase your dream every day.  True, girl, you know it's true, that if you really wanna be you, you've gotta do what you wanna do.  He was unhappy 'cause he just wanted to play ball	[]
