Mr. Garrison	14	0	Okay, children. Each of you gets to choose two books from the Booktastic bus.	[]
Cartman	3	1	Reading sucks ass.	['ass']
Mr. Garrison	3	0	Eric, shut up!	[]
Kyle	5	1	Boring. Boring. Gay. Boring. Boring.	['gay']
Stan	9	0	Hey you guys. Check out these books.  Sabrina Unchained.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Wow, these books look cool!	[]
Cartman	11	0	Hey, there's a lot of big words in these books.	[]
Kenny	9	3	(There's a lot of fuckin' vaginas and penises.)	['fuckin', 'vaginas', 'penises']
Other	11	0	Hello, kids. I see you're discovering the magic of reading.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Who are you?	[]
Other	52	0	I drive the Booktastic bus, where magic begins. You see, reading opens up whole new worlds to you. You can take a canoe down the Amazon or go back in time to Camelot or become a race car driver, all by just opening a book. Just like magic. The magic of reading.	[]
Cartman	4	0	God, shut up, dude.	[]
Other	16	0	Go ahead and pick any books you like. Then give in. Give in to the magic.	[]
Stan	10	0	If we read, are we gonna become like that guy?	[]
Kyle	8	0	Yeah, this is stupid! Books aren't magical.	[]
Cartman	14	0	I don't know, I'm kinda getting a tingly feeling looking at these.	[]
Kenny	4	0	(Hey, what's that?)	[]
Stan	8	0	I don't know. Let's go see.	[]
Other	48	0	Well, being an officer of the peace means a lot of things. It's a hard job, but then I'm a hard man. A lot of people think that in a small town there isn't a lot for the law to do. Well, they're wrong.	[]
Other	14	0	All units. All units. Report to 254 Avenue de los Mexicanos. Possible hostile situation.	[]
Other	21	0	There, you see? This could be a bank robbery. Or possibly even a murder! This ain't no podunk little town!	[]
Other	16	0	And, Barbrady, your wife called. She wants you to get some pizza on the way home.	[]
Other	1	1	Goddammit!	['goddammit']
Other	18	0	Okay, people, move along. There's nothing to see here.  What's the trouble? Where's the body?	[]
Other	15	1	Barbrady, I just caught some guy in here having sex with one of my chickens.	['sex']
Other	2	0	Uhhhh... oh.	[]
Other	5	0	My God, that's disgusting!	[]
Stan	10	1	Whoa, dude! How do you have sex with a chicken?	['sex']
Other	22	0	Uhh, boys, you move along. This isn't for young eyes to see.  Did you get a good look at the suspect?	[]
Other	11	0	Naw, I didn't see anything. It just happened so fast.	[]
Other	8	0	Wellll uh, this is quite interesting, huh, guys?	[]
Other	20	0	Uhh, we're gonna go grab some lunch and maybe get some shots of those turtles down at the pond.	[]
Other	3	1	Haw, camel poo.	['poo']
Stan	4	0	Hey, what's this?	[]
Kyle	5	0	It looks like a note.	[]
Other	17	0	Give me that!  That's a clue, and you'll get your stinking DNA all over it!	[]
Other	4	0	What does it say?	[]
Other	26	1	Uhh... It says, uuh, Sorry I had sex with the chicken. I won't do it again. Bye-bye. Well, there you have it. Case closed.	['sex']
Other	35	2	Dammit, Barbrady, what the hell's wrong with you? Every time somethin' happens in this town, you say Nothin' to see here, and Case closed. But we want justice. We have to find this sicko!	['dammit', 'hell']
Other	11	0	I said, return to your homes before I start arresting people.	[]
Other	4	0	For what? Orderly conduct?	[]
Other	6	0	How about fishing without a license?	[]
Other	4	0	I'm not fishin'.	[]
Other	42	0	Whataya call this then?  If you do not comply, I'll be forced to execute each and every one of you  by gunshot to the head.  That's right, return to your simple lives.  Just forget this ever happened. Forget.  For-get.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Wow. Barbrady sure is acting weird.	[]
Stan	6	0	Yeah, I wonder what's wrong.	[]
Other	13	0	Welcome to Fran's. Can I help you?  Sir, can I help you?	[]
Other	10	0	Uhhh, just give me two cheeseburgers and some jalapeno poppers.	[]
Other	6	0	Sure, there's just one problem.	[]
Other	3	0	What's that?	[]
Other	4	0	We're a bank.	[]
Other	14	0	I know that, smarty-pants! What do you think, I'm some kinda idiot?	[]
Other	1	0	Yes.	[]
Other	9	0	Hmmm.  I can't go on living this lie!	[]
Other	38	1	With chicken after chicken being violated, the South Park police are under increasing pressure to solve the case of the Chickenfucker. We now go live to a press conference where Officer Barbrady and the Mayor are fielding questions.	['chickenfucker']
Other	12	0	Officer Barbrady, what would drive a man to such a disgusting act?	[]
Other	13	0	Well, nobody can say for sure; uh, no motive has yet been established.	[]
Other	6	0	Do the police have any leads?	[]
Other	17	0	Well, both 3D computer modeling and intensive seismology have not given us any leads as of yet.	[]
Other	9	1	But has Chickenfucker left any clues at the crime?	['chickenfucker']
Other	46	0	All right, all right! I can't read!  There, I said it! I can't read! Are you happy now? You pushed and you pushed, and now you all know my terrible secret! I'm illegitimate! I'm not fit to be a policeman! I retire!	[]
Other	14	0	Okay, thank you all for coming. There's uhh, coffee and brownies out front.	[]
Other	52	0	And so Officer Barbrady has taken a leave of absence, and South Park would have to manage without any police force for a while--  This just in! South Park is plunged into total anarchy!  Exactly two seconds after the retirement of Officer Barbrady, looting and pillaging erupted in the quiet mountain town!	[]
Other	4	0	Whoopee, this is killer!	[]
Other	10	0	With no cops around, we can do whatever we want!	[]
Kyle	6	0	Whoa, dude, what's going on?	[]
Stan	13	0	I don't know.  Oh my God, they've killed--  Oh, never mind.	[]
Other	15	0	I don't believe it. All this time, Barbrady actually did keep this town peaceful.	[]
Other	10	0	Who knew? I always thought he was a complete idiot.	[]
Other	2	0	He is.	[]
Other	11	0	What do you plan to do about the South Park riots?	[]
Other	20	0	No reason for concern. I want to assure all of you that Officer Barbrady is still our active police force.	[]
Other	10	0	But he's illiterate. What do you plan to do?	[]
Other	7	0	Uhhhhh, plan? I don't actually uh--	[]
Other	24	0	Reading classes, plain and simple. By the mayor's order, Officer Barbrady is on temporary leave of absence to learn to read, effective immediately.	[]
Other	12	0	Yes, that's right. It's back to school with Officer Barbrady!	[]
Other	16	0	Now, children, we have a new student joining us today. Please say 'hi' to Officer Barbrady.	[]
Stan	5	0	I can't see, dude!	[]
Other	21	0	Okay now, since our focus has been on reading, let's review some of the basics.  E-yes, what is it?	[]
Other	5	0	I need to go poopies.	[]
Other	13	0	Officer Barbrady, in school we go to the bathroom before and after class.	[]
Other	8	0	Oh, Christ. How do you kids do it?	[]
Other	13	0	Now, does anyone have any suggestions where we should begin with Officer Barbrady?	[]
Kyle	5	0	How about a brain transplant?	[]
Other	43	0	Now, Kyle, let's be supportive of our new student, give him the nurturing environment he needs to thrive. Now, I'm gonna write a sentence and I want us all to help Officer Barbrady read it.  Give it a shot, Officer Barbrady.	[]
Other	3	0	Ahhh... O... O--	[]
Other	34	0	Bzzzt! Wrong! Try again, dumbass! Hahahahahahaha  hahahaha!  Okay, okay. Maybe we should try something a little easier. We can work our way up to the hard ones.  Go ahead, Barbrady, don't be scared.	[]
Other	2	0	Ahhh... O...	[]
Other	8	0	Bzzzt drrrrr! Did you hear that, Mr. Hat?	[]
Other	8	1	I sure did, Mr. Garrison. What a retard!	['retard']
Other	10	0	Did you kids actually learn how to read this way?	[]
Stan	9	0	No, we just fake it to shut him up.	[]
Other	13	0	Okayheh, okay hi'm sohry. I'm sohry heh. Let's try again.	[]
Other	13	0	So, what are nice chickens like you doing in a coop like this?	[]
Other	31	0	Now, children, I hope you all had a good time reading your books and are prepared for your book reports.  Who should we have go first, Mr. Hat? Let's see...	[]
Cartman	6	0	Oh, how about Stan? Or Kyle?	[]
Other	7	0	Eric, why don't you go first?	[]
Cartman	1	0	Oooaaagh.	[]
Other	10	0	What's the matter, Eric? Are you not prepared again?	[]
Cartman	27	0	I'm prepared!  For my book report, I read The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe. It was very, very good. Have you read it, Mr. Garrison?	[]
Other	8	0	No, I can't say that I have.	[]
Cartman	50	0	Oh, good. In The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe, a bunch of uh, hippies, walk around and paint stuff. They eat lunch, and then they find a magical... camel... which they have to eat to stay alive. And that's pretty much it; I give it a B-minus.	[]
Other	10	0	And I give you an F, Eric. Now sit down!	[]
Cartman	2	1	God-dammit!	['dammit']
Other	5	0	Haa haa. Ha ha ha.	[]
Other	12	0	Okay, Officer Barbrady, why don't you give us your book report?	[]
Other	66	0	I've just finished reading the heartwarming novel, Go, Dog. Go!. I found it a compelling and disturbing look at the canine psyche. If I may read a passage: Big... dog..., little... dog.  A red dog... on a... Well, anyway, I'm not one to give away the ending, but I will say that it spirals toward an incredible twist-turn that parallels my own life.	[]
Other	18	0	Thank you, Officer Barbrady. That was a very good book report indeed. I'll give you an A.	[]
Other	1	0	Hooray!	[]
Cartman	3	0	Goody two-shoes.	[]
Other	16	0	Swingset, swingset, up and down I go Whoosh! goes the willy-wind, flowing through my toes	[]
Stan	12	0	Dude, I think Barbrady enjoys being in school a little too much.	[]
Kyle	12	0	Yeah, isn't he just supposed to be learning how to read?	[]
Other	7	0	Swingset, swingset, up and down I go...	[]
Other	6	0	Officer Barbrady, what are you doing?!	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Daaarrrggghh--)  (-ooggghhh...)	[]
Stan	6	0	Oh, my God! They've killed--	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Hey.)	[]
Stan	3	0	Oh, never mind.	[]
Other	7	0	Well, how's the reading coming along?	[]
Other	3	0	Oooh, pretty good.	[]
Other	15	1	Barbrady, we really need you to speed this up. The Chickenfucker struck again last night.	['chickenfucker']
Kyle	2	0	Oh no!	[]
Other	15	0	Ah, Mayor, please, when we're around children we prefer to call him the Chickenlover.	[]
Other	13	0	This time he made love to Carla Weathers' prize chicken. She's catatonic.	[]
Other	6	0	Who? Carla Weathers or the chicken?	[]
Other	9	0	The perpetrator left this clue at the crime scene.	[]
Other	11	0	Oh, I can't read this. It has silent e's.	[]
Other	8	0	You have to learn to read faster, Barbrady!	[]
Other	16	0	I'm doing the best I can. I even got a A on my book report.	[]
Other	21	0	Listen, buddy! Either you learn to read quick, or else I'm gonna find a law officer to replace you forever!	[]
Other	7	0	Hey, what'd you do that for?	[]
Other	5	0	Uh, just dramatic effect, sorry.	[]
Other	21	0	Oh boy, I'm in big trouble.  I'll never learn to read fast enough, and the town is in chaos.	[]
Stan	8	0	It's cool, dude. We'll help you.	[]
Other	27	0	Hey, that's right. You can help me. Under article 39, section 2 of police code, I'm allowed to deputize citizens in a time of crisis.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Really? I wanna be a cop.	[]
Other	21	0	You boys will be my deputies; you can help me restore order, catch the Chickenlover, and swing me on the swingset.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Do I get a nightstick?	[]
Other	22	0	Sure, nightsticks for everybody!  You keep a tab on crime in the city, and we'll try to solve the Chickenlover case.	[]
Cartman	3	0	10-4, sergeant!	[]
Other	7	0	Now, what did that clue say again?	[]
Stan	17	0	If you want to know where I'll strike next, read Bumbly Wumbly and the Spotted Spacecraft.	[]

Other	13	0	That's quick thinking, deputy. Let's get to Stark's Pond immediately!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Ey!	[]
Randy	3	0	Uhh, yes, Officer?	[]
Cartman	19	0	I clocked you at 40 miles an hour back there. Do you know what the speed limit is heawh?	[]

Cartman	1	0	Sweet.	[]
Randy	1	0	Ooww!	[]
Other	7	0	Oh, weak, dude! We're too late!	[]
Stan	9	0	Well, the chickens don't seem to really mind.	[]
Other	12	1	Well, this is terrible! Now, who would have sex with a chicken?	['sex']
Other	2	0	I would.	[]
Other	13	0	Aw, you couldn't screw anything, Halfy. You don't have any legs!	[]
Other	2	0	Oh... yeah.	[]

Other	10	0	Come on, dudes. We need to look for another clue.	[]

Cartman	6	0	Sir, step out of the car.	[]
Other	9	0	Hey, wait a minute. You're just a kid!	[]
Cartman	9	0	Maybe this'll teach you to listen to authoritah.	[]
Other	13	0	Ow! Oo-uhow! Ow! Hey, man, what are you doing?! Ow, stop it!	[]
Cartman	16	0	Yeah... Sometimes upholding the law is messy. But you get by. One day at a time.	[]

Stan	6	0	What are you talking about, dude?!	[]
Other	31	0	When I heard that Officer Barbrady couldn't read, I knew I had to motivate him somehow. So I formulated a plan to encourage him to learn the magic of reading!	[]
Kyle	7	1	So you fucked a bunch of chickens?	['fucked']
Other	19	1	Yes! Yes, exactly! Don't you see? Only by fucking chickens could I get Officer Barbrady to become literate.	['fucking']
Stan	10	0	That doesn't... make a whole..lot of sense, dude.	[]
Other	19	0	Oh, no? He who was blind can now see!  I got Officer Brabrady to read. My plan worked perfectly.	[]

Other	1	0	Heee--!	[]
Other	12	0	You've gotta get 'em in the head; they go down quicker.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Ooohhhh.	[]
Kyle	12	0	I guess you should leave police work to the professionals, huh, Cartman?	[]

Other	1	0	Hooray!	[]
Stan	9	0	Hey! So what are you going to do now?	[]

Other	2	0	Oh, yeah!	[]
Other	39	1	Second, I'd like to say to all those out there who think they can screw chickens just to teach people to read, your days are numbered!  And finally, I'd like to say that  reading totally sucks ass!	['ass']
Other	1	0	Hooray!	[]
Other	48	1	Yes, at first, I was happy to be learning how to read. It seemed exciting and magical. But then I read this: Atlas Shrugged, by Ayn Rand. I read every last word of this garbage, and because of this piece of sh-shit, I'm never reading again!	['shit']
Other	3	0	Hooray for Barbrady!	[]
Kyle	8	1	Wow! I guess reading really does suck ass!	['ass']
Cartman	12	0	Ey, that's what I've been saying all along, you guys.	[]
Stan	14	0	I'm just glad everything turned out okay, and Barbrady got his job back.	[]
Kyle	4	0	It's poetic justice.	[]
Other	2	0	Thanks, boys.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Ow!)	[]
