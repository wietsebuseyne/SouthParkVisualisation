Other	9	0	Oh! Hey Kyle!__Kyle, hang on a sec._	[]
Kyle	5	0	Hey Jimmy. What's up?	[]
Other	30	0	Not much. I just wanted to make sure you heard the fuh-fantastic news. There's a new Terrance & Phillip mobile game, and it's so amazing and incredibly fun.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Oh. Really?	[]
Other	31	0	Yeah! And the most unbelievable part? It's totally free. You should download it to your phone right now. I mean, come. On. If it's free, why wouldn't you?	[]
Kyle	9	0	Cool. Thanks, Jimmy, well, I'll check it out.	[]
Other	4	0	You betcha, pal._	[]
Other	21	0	The Terrance & Phillip Mobile Game.__In this game, you are Terrance & Phillip. Can you collect all the Canadian coins? *poot*_	[]
Other	23	0	That's one coin. Can you collect more?__You've collected ten Canadian coins!__Congratulations!__Hey, you're really good at this, guy!	[]
Kyle	1	0	What?	[]
Butters	2	0	Congratulations, Kyle.	[]
Other	35	0	With Canada coins, you can buy stuff that helps Terrance & Phillip rebuild Canada.__Run around and collect more coins, or better yet, buy them in bulk!__How many Canadian coins would you like to buy?	[]
Kyle	3	0	This is stupid!	[]
Butters	11	0	Well, it's just 49 cents for the cheapest one._	[]
Other	26	0	You buy 200 Canadian coins for 49 cents! You're amazing! Now use that Canadough to help rebuild Canada! Click to build a hospital here._	[]
Other	1	0	Yaaay!	[]
Kyle	12	0	It's still stupid and now I paid 49 cents for it!	[]
Cartman	6	1	What are you two boners doing?	['boners']
Butters	8	0	We're playing the Terrance & Phillip Freemium Game.	[]
Cartman	15	1	I played that thing; it's fuckin' dumb. I ended up paying like five bucks.	['fuckin']
Kyle	4	1	Who makes this crap?	['crap']
Other	15	0	Oh! It's tewwific! That's 200,000 more American dollars in just one day!	[]
Other	7	0	Where is the roof on this thing?	[]
Other	12	0	What's the big idea making a mobile game without our approval?!	[]
Other	10	0	Ohh, Terrance & Phillip! How are Canada's two favorite buddies?	[]
Other	19	0	What gives you the right to make a stupid Terrance & Phillip mobile game?! Who do you think you are?!	[]
Other	18	0	Oh, I'm only the Prince of Canada! And this happens to be the Minister of Mobile Gaming.	[]
Other	14	0	We thought you would be pleased with the quality of the mobile game-eh.	[]
Other	14	0	It's the dumbest game over! All you do is collect and spend Canadough!	[]
Other	14	0	Ey! We know the game's not great, but who cares? It's free!	[]
Other	18	0	But it's_not_free! If you charge 40 cents here and 50 cents there, then it's not free!	[]
Other	5	0	They see through the charade.	[]
Other	5	0	Uh oh, you think so?	[]
Other	8	0	I think they see through the charade, yes.	[]
Other	10	0	I'm pretty sure they can hear us too._	[]
Other	64	1	Alright, fuck it! You've seen through the charade, so you might as well know everything. Charade up!__Allow me to explain the science behind micropay premium gaming. For years gaming was simple. You pay for the game and you enjoy. With mobile apps we now have the ability to make games that are boring and stupid. But if you_pay_for incentives, you're rewarded!	['fuck']
Other	8	0	Freemium. The mium is Latin for not really.	[]
Other	44	0	It's a simple cycle. A never-ending loop based on RPG. Explore. Collect. Spend. Improve. But whereas those just use the concept of XP or Experience Points, we've introduced the idea of micro-paying with money. Money. Money. Money money money money.	[]
Other	22	0	It's what everyone is doing. Freemium games are what's now. And it's all just a lot of harmless fun.	[]
Randy	22	0	You're in big trouble, Stanley! Can you explain to us how you managed to spend $489 on a mobile app?!_	[]
Stan	11	0	I'm sorry. I didn't really I spent that much.	[]
Randy	8	0	You didn't realize! What are Canadian coins?	[]
Stan	8	0	You buy Canadian coins so you have Canadough.	[]
Randy	22	0	Stan, just because I make a good living with my music doesn't mean you can go blow it all on Canadough!	[]
Stan	8	0	I'll pay you back for it, okay?!	[]
Randy	1	0	How?!	[]
Stan	11	0	I don't know, I'll figure it ou! Jesus Christ!	[]
Randy	32	0	Can you believe him?! He_knew_how much he was spending! He_knew_he'd get in trouble, but it didn't matter!__I hate to say it, but this is a lot like his grandpa.	[]
Other	3	0	Wull whattaya mean?	[]
Randy	23	0	Dad's always had a gambling problem. He's got total addiction tendencies. Could he have somehow... passed those demons down to Stan?	[]
Other	12	0	Well then you certainly have some of those problems too with drinking.	[]
Randy	35	0	I_had_a problem, but I was able to stop. Now I only drink gluten-free beer and wine. But with Stan, I think there's some darkness inside him that... doesn't... allow him to stop.	[]
Other	57	0	And so in conclusion, the successful premium game is based on five principles. Entice the player with a simple game loop, use lots of flashing chachings and compliments to make the player feel good about themselves, train the players to spend your fake currency, offer the player a way to spend real currency for your fake currency-	[]
Other	8	0	So they'll forget they're spending money.	[]
Other	24	0	-and make the game about waiting. But let the player pay not to wait. It's a surefire way to make lots of money.	[]
Other	18	0	We understand micropaying, but can't the game hidden inside the charade it- just at least be fun?	[]
Other	29	0	No no! It has to be just_barely_fun. If the game were too fun, then there would be no reason to micropay in order to make it more fun._	[]
Other	3	0	What's this?	[]
Other	10	0	Your checks of course. For ten million American dollars. Each.	[]
Other	7	0	So this is- Everyone is doing this?	[]
Other	4	0	Ehhhveryone is doing it.	[]
Other	8	0	It's just the way things are going?	[]
Other	7	0	It's the way things are going!	[]
Other	19	0	Well, I guess if everyone is just paying forty cents at a time it can't be that bad.	[]
Other	3	0	Hey Phillip!_	[]
Stan	3	0	Ohhh hey guys.	[]
Kyle	4	0	You... missed school today?	[]
Stan	8	0	Yeah, I just wasn't feelin' the best.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Did you play the Terrance & Phillip freemium game all day?	[]
Stan	13	0	Well yeah, I was sick in bed. What else was I gonna do?	[]
Cartman	8	0	How much money did you micropay today, Stan?	[]
Stan	20	0	Nothing! Dude, I bought like $10 worth of Canadough. But check it out, I unlocked the stadium in Toronto._	[]
Kyle	10	0	You spent $10 and eight hours to unlock a stadium?	[]
Stan	12	0	You guys, is it that much dumber than video games you play?	[]
Cartman	1	0	Yes.	[]
Stan	19	0	It's just something to kill some time. Like Jimmy said, it's a cool way to zone out.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Waitwaitwait, Jimmy told you about this game?	[]
Cartman	4	0	Jimmy told_me_about this game.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Kenny, who told you about this game?	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Jimmy.)	[]
Kyle	2	0	Dude, what?!	[]
Cartman	1	0	The?!	[]
Kenny	1	1	(Fuck?!)	['fuck']
Other	20	0	Pssst. Hey, kid. Come over here.__Yeah, come on over. Ch-check this out. You looking to have some fun?	[]
Other	4	0	What do you mean?	[]
Other	12	0	The Terrance & Phillip mobile game.__All the cool kids are usin' it.	[]
Other	5	0	Aw, I don't know.	[]
Other	62	0	Come, on, just try it out. You can be Terrance or Phillip or both. You can walk around and collect Canada cash to build new stuff.__It's the perfect thing if you're bored. And honestly, the best part about it, is it's free. I mean, come. On. Why wouldn't you download it, and just try it out?_	[]
Kyle	6	0	Hey, uh, Jimmy, can we talk?	[]
Other	11	0	Why sure fellas.__Anyway, be sure to check it out, kid.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Dude, what are you doing?!	[]
Other	8	0	Just hangin' out. What are you up to?	[]
Kyle	9	0	You need to stop recommending that app to people!	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Yeah!)	[]
Cartman	10	0	Everyone we know says they heard about it from you!	[]
Other	11	0	I just think it's a fabulous app, that's all.	[]
Cartman	10	1	It's not a fabulous app! It's fuckin' stupid!	['fuckin']
Kyle	17	0	Let me ask you something, Jimmy: What happens on level 2 after you get the Ontario Nugget?!	[]
Other	12	0	Alright alright! I never played it. I stay away from the stuff.	[]
Kyle	7	0	You just push it on other people?!	[]
Other	4	0	They pay me to!	[]
Kyle	5	0	Who, Jimmy?! Who pays you?!	[]
Other	17	0	You've both done an amazing job. New hospitals, new neighborhoods, all funded by one freemium game.	[]
Other	18	0	Ahh, listen, ahh, we've been talking it over, and we really are uncomfortable with this freemium thing.	[]
Other	6	0	Oh. Ah what is the matter?	[]
Other	11	0	It seems dishonest and we have a brand to protect._	[]
Other	22	0	But just look at all the things we're getting to build. Soon, Canada will be as advanced and developed as Michigan.	[]
Other	20	0	We're just worried that some people will abuse the game and start spending more money than they can afford.	[]
Other	41	0	Hoh non! Well, we certainly wouldn't want that!__Oh! I have an idea! How about we take some of the billions of dollars we are making and, we start a campaign to teach everyone to play the game in moderation?	[]
Other	2	0	Ohhhhh._	[]
Other	7	0	Do you really think that would help?	[]
Other	10	0	Of course! The alcohol industry does it all the time!	[]
Other	63	8	You. Friends. Fun. Drink. Hot girls. You're hot. Drink more. Expensive cars. Ass, drink, ass, money, you in a tuxedo, threesomes, vodka, pussy, drink, drink, drink, you, drink, Vegas, fun, pussy, you, in a tuxedo, fucking this girl, vodka, drink drink drink drink it all you fucking pussy! MORE TUXEDOS, MORE CARS, MORE PUSSY, MORE VODKA, DRINK DRINK DRINK!__Please drink responsibly.	['ass', 'ass', 'pussy', 'pussy', 'fucking', 'fucking', 'pussy', 'pussy']
Randy	60	0	Come on. This way, Stan. I want you to see this. There you go.__That's your grandpa. He sits at that slot machine and mindlessly drains money away a little bit at a time. Sound familiar? All the little sounds and lights are calculated to keep him sitting at that stupid machine.__Come on Dad, we're going home.	[]
Other	3	0	I'm going.	[]
Randy	17	1	Do you know what you've done to your grandson? You've infected him with your bullshit!	['bullshit']
Other	5	0	What are you talkin' about?	[]
Randy	19	0	I just don't understand what is_wrong_with you two! What is the joy that this stuff possibly brings you?!	[]
Stan	3	0	It's just...	[]
Other	3	0	It's fun.	[]
Stan	4	0	Yeah, it's fun.	[]
Randy	14	0	It's not fun! You two have demons you're trying to compensate for!	[]
Other	11	0	Well what about you?! You're havin' a glass of wine!	[]
Randy	21	0	I'm not having a glass of wine, I'm having six!__It's called a tasting, and it's classy!	[]
Stan	23	0	Dad, I'm not addicted. I can stop. I just like playing it, but I don't have to. I'll prove it.	[]
Other	8	0	Yeah, and if he stops, I'll stop.	[]
Randy	23	0	All right. And if you two stop, then we won't have a problem anymore.__HM. Earthy, bold, hint of cherry aftertones. *uurp*	[]
Other	41	0	Is it my responsibility what people decide to do with their feh-f-free time? I was just a middleman.__People were going to learn about the game somewhere if not from me. I'm not the one who made it.	[]
Kyle	20	0	But you accepted money from the Canadian government! To push a freemium game on us! Why would they do that?!	[]
Cartman	30	0	How do you get people addicted to crack? You give it away for free. You give away a little taste and then... and then some people... can't stop themselves.	[]
Cartman	28	1	And now Stan is so consumed by the shit you've been pushing that he can't even see through it! How could you sell out your friend?!	['shit']
Other	56	0	I needed the money, alright?!__I downloaded Yum Yum Sparkly Gem Forest because it was free. I love the sparkly little gems. The sounds they made when I got new ones. Then I made my first in-app purchase. Before I knew it I had spent my allowance, then my birthday money, I LOST my CRUTCHES!	[]
Kyle	2	0	You_have_your crutches!	[]
Other	25	1	It's a figure of speech with crippled people. We'd say we lost an arm and a leg, but they ain't worth much.	['crippled']
Cartman	3	0	That makes sense.	[]
Kyle	9	0	You're saging these games do this on purpose?!	[]
Other	40	0	Why do you think freemium games send you those text notifications when you haven't played in a while? It's called a trigger. A quick image to trigger the addict's brain. They know exactly what they're doing.	[]
Other	25	0	Hey buddih. Come on, guy.__Come back, friend. You've got new buddies, guy.__We've just given you 5000 Canadian coins.__Enjoy you Canadough.	[]
Stan	2	0	...Free?_	[]
Randy	12	0	What is wrong with you, Stan?! You said you stopped buying Canadough!	[]
Stan	21	0	I didn't think I spent that much. I, I clicked on a few micropays and it just kinda added up.	[]
Randy	18	0	$26,000??? Do you know how many songs I have to write to make back that much money?!	[]
Stan	1	0	One?	[]
Randy	10	0	Oh, it's just nothing' to you, isn't it?!	[]
Stan	5	0	No, no, it's not.	[]
Randy	25	0	You need to realize that you have something in your brain that you somehow inherited from your grandpa that makes you act this way, okay?!	[]
Stan	16	0	I don't know how you can say that when you're standing here chugging beer!	[]
Randy	31	0	I am not chugging beer!__I'm sampling a flight of gluten-free German lagers with a French wine pairing! It's called a smorgaswein, and it's elegantly cultural!_	[]
Stan	30	0	Okay, I need help.__There is something different about me, you guys. I know the game is stupid, and it actually isn't even fun anymore. I don't understand.	[]
Other	9	0	Fellas, can I have a moment with Stan, please?	[]
Kyle	5	0	Sure. Come on, guys._	[]
Other	18	0	This is my fault, Stan. I should have never told you the game was fuh fufuh fan-fantastic.	[]
Stan	18	0	It's not your fault. It's something to do with my family. It's like a curse.	[]
Other	21	0	I know this stuff is hard to understand. Trust me, I know. I'm an addict too. But I got help.	[]
Stan	1	0	How?	[]
Other	46	0	What all the addiction programs say is true. You've gotta reach out to a higher power, Stan. You've gotta get down on your knees, and you've gotta say I have a problem. And you've gotta ask that higher power for help._	[]
Kyle	59	0	We have to find a way to get the word out! People need to know pushers are being hired to take advantage of people with addiction problems! There has to be a way that we can get to the news company, and sneak in and somehow borrow their TV signal. If we could disguise ourselves as something ridiculous, then-	[]
Cartman	4	0	It's done._	[]
Kyle	4	0	Wuh, what's done?	[]
Cartman	19	0	The word is out.__Terrance & Phillip hire pushers to make money off addicts. I tweeted it.__It's trending.	[]
Other	16	1	You son of a bitch! You paid pushers to get addicts hooked on our freemium game?!	['bitch']
Other	2	0	You what?	[]
Other	14	0	Now hold on, Terrance & Philip, there's nothing wrong with promoting a mobile game.	[]
Other	14	0	But there's something very wrong with knowingly making it appeal to human weaknesses!	[]
Other	12	0	You didn't build a mobile game, you built an addiction machine!	[]
Other	9	0	Minister of mobile gaming, what's this all aboot?	[]
Other	71	0	Alright, alright, you've seen through the charade again. Let me explain how freemium games_really_work.__The truth is, a very small percentage of people who download freemium games ever pay anything for them. It's all aboot finding the heaviest users and extracting the most amount of cash from them. That's how you get addicts to pay two hundred bucks for a game that's not even worth forty cents.	[]
Other	10	0	But then all our profits come from people with problems.	[]
Other	16	0	Don't think aboot that. Think about all the money. Here, have a bump of coke.	[]
Other	9	0	Okay, but we still won't stand for this!	[]
Stan	32	0	I don't know if you're listening, but... I guess I have something inside me that I can't control. Something... kind of dark. Please... help show me the way?_	[]
Other	10	0	You have summoned the Prince of Temptation! For what purpose?!	[]
Stan	13	1	Whoa shit. Uhhh, I have addiction demons and I don't understand them.	['shit']
Other	59	2	Then allow me to explain the darkness of the human soul!__So you got dopa-mine, right? That's the chemical that gets released in your brain whenever you do something pleasurable, like eating, sex, and that's just nature, right? Like rabbits and fish and shit. They need dopa mine so that they want to consume and reproduce.	['sex', 'shit']
Stan	1	0	Okay.	[]
Other	41	2	But because humans have progressed and now have access to all the shit they want whenever they want it, it's easy for them to overdo and have dopa-mine problems. You know, it's not fuckin' rocket science, this stuff.	['shit', 'fuckin']
Stan	8	0	So there's nothing spiritually wrong with me?	[]
Other	92	3	Fuck no! It's like, okay, it's like being diabetic. You know, it's like you can eat wrong and eat wrong and chemicals get released from your liver in a weird way, you know, you've been eatin' gluten and shit, and then eventually you've got a chemical imbalance from your liver. And something clicked, and now you're diabetic forever, right? So like, if you keep doing something too much, eventually there's, ummm, a dopa-mine fuckup, right, and you're kind of screwed up for life.	['fuck', 'shit', 'fuckup']
Stan	18	0	So what does that mean? I I can get addicted to everything so I can't enjoy anything?	[]
Other	8	0	Yeah, that's pretty much what it means.	[]
Stan	10	0	The addict people said something about me filling a hole.	[]
Other	30	2	Well who's not filling a fuckin' hole? Right? You know, I mean what kind of bullshit is that? So, let's talk about genetics now. You still have time?	['fuckin', 'bullshit']
Stan	5	0	Yeah, no, this is great.	[]
Other	11	0	Okay, let me get some visual aids. Gimme juuust a sec.	[]
Other	33	0	Here is a fact: 80% of alcohol sales are paid for by alcoholics. Using slot machine tactics, freemium games are able to make millions off of an even smaller percentage of mobile gamers.	[]
Other	7	0	Oh God, he just doesn't stop!	[]
Other	4	0	Who IS this guy?!	[]
Other	68	2	We're building a new Canada with micropayments from addicts! Who cares?! You think the fucking alcohol industry cares?! They don't care that 10% are gonna get addicted, they're counting on it!! It's the same with ut! But we've got our eye on every addict's screen!_Every button they click, we get feedback on how to shove this shit right down their throats!	['fucking', 'shit']
Other	11	0	Why does he suddenly sound like Al Pacino in_Devil's Advocate?!	[]
Other	14	0	Hohon, I'm much worse than the Devil.__I'm the Canadian Devil._	[]
Other	8	0	Oh dear God! It's the Canadian Devil!	[]
Other	1	0	Beelzeboot!	[]
Other	16	0	You discovered my plan, but too late!__Now the souls of all Canadians belong to me!	[]
Other	2	0	Oh no!	[]
Other	5	0	Oh, what have I done?!	[]
Other	3	0	Heheheh! Hahaha!_	[]
Other	43	0	So basically, the genes you got from your dad make you more likely to have trouble with, um, dopa-mine regulation, and that's why you need to kind of watch out for addictive stuff._Okay, so we kind of understand now, champ?	[]
Stan	16	0	I guess so, but why do companies have to put so many addictive things out there?	[]
Other	45	1	You know, they all do it, and it's kind of my deal, I have to put temptation out there too so people have free will and all that shit. But you know, everyone has their justification and thinks what they're doing is okay.	['shit']
Other	13	0	*Ding* Ey, buddy, where'd you go? Don't you want more Canadough?	[]
Other	3	0	What's this?	[]
Stan	18	0	That's what I've been addicted to. It's a freemium game sending me push notifications._	[]
Other	5	0	What, you just collect coints?	[]
Other	7	0	How much money can you buy today?	[]
Other	29	0	No, see, if something's addictive because it's fun, that's one thing. But this is just blatant Skinner box manipulation. Wait a minute. Who put this out?	[]
Stan	2	0	Ah, Canada?	[]
Other	42	3	Oh that son of a bitch! He's always doing this shit! I tell him, temptation has to be nuanced! but he goes and does this crap again! I'm gonna need to borrow your soul real quick, kid. Is that alright?	['bitch', 'shit', 'crap']
Stan	2	0	...Okay.__Aaaaahhh!	[]
Randy	5	0	Oh pass interference! Interference!_	[]
Other	6	0	Stan, where are you going?_	[]
Stan	10	0	I shall return. Do not attempt to stop me._	[]
Randy	12	0	Told ya. Kid's got demons. I don't do that._	[]
Other	27	0	Horror and sadness all over Canada tonight. When the Prince signed the agreement to make a freemium game, he apparently made a deal with the Canadian Devil.	[]
Other	8	0	Hey, guy, I'm the Canadian Devil._	[]
Other	25	0	The Canadian Devil now has complete control of the soul of every Canadian. This is a sad day for Canada, and therefore, the world._	[]
Other	5	0	Heh heheheh, stab you._	[]
Other	9	0	Beelzeboot! Once again you lack any sense of nuance!	[]
Other	5	1	Who the fuck is that?	['fuck']
Other	13	0	Well well, my overachieving doppelganger! You're no match for Canadian Satan!_	[]
Other	6	0	Return from whence you came!_	[]
Other	5	0	Ow! Watch it, guy!_	[]
Other	52	0	Sadly, a shocking turn of events here as the actual Devil has now appeared and seems to be fighting the Canadian Devil! This is certainly a conundrum for Canadians everywhere as we try to figure out who to root for. For that, let's ask the Minister of Sports in Edmonton._	[]
Other	34	0	Well of course, the patriotic thing to do would be to root for the Canadian Devil. But then again, he is the one who has promised us pain and servitude for a million years.	[]
Other	4	0	Screw that, go Canada!	[]
Other	7	0	Enough, Beelzeboot! Thy end has come._	[]
Kyle	2	0	Hey dude.	[]
Stan	1	0	Hey.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Y-you alright?	[]
Stan	10	0	Yeah. Yeah, I think I'm gonna be okay._	[]
Cartman	1	0	Cool.	[]
Other	82	1	My fellow Canadians, what we do now as a country will hopefully be a model for others. We have all learned a tragic lesson together: that though many sins are out there, when you get involved with freemium gaming, you are making a deal with the Canadian Devil. We will no longer make freemium games, and we will no longer make improvements to our country with money taken from addicts. Canada is back to being an ethical, respected, and shitty tundra._	['shitty']
Stan	17	0	I'm gonna move here and here, and then I'm gonna roll to kill this zombie.	[]
Other	5	0	Well okay, good idea._	[]
Randy	5	1	What are you gaywads doin'?	['gaywads']
Stan	16	0	We're playing board games, so that Grandpa avoids the casino and I avoid freemium apps.	[]
Randy	24	0	Well all right! Good for you guys. Tell you what, I'll join you. Board games go good with a glass of wine._	[]
Stan	14	0	That's not a glass, that's a trophy, that you won, for drinking.	[]
Randy	22	1	It's not drinking. It's called a White Zinfandel Sipping Sprint, and it's competitive. Get off your high fuckin' horse.	['fuckin']
Stan	17	0	Your turn, Grandpa. If you roll a five or a six, you can kill these zombies._	[]
Randy	9	0	You guys wanna put some money on it?_	[]
