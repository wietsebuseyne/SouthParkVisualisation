Other	47	0	Gentlemen, I understand you are here to present both sides of an issue. I wanna hear you both out and do this in a civil and constructive manner so that I can give you both the time and attention you deserve. Jimbo, why don't you begin?	[]
Other	8	0	Mayor, it's about the South Park flag.	[]
Other	6	0	Oh, Jesus Christ, not this again!	[]
Other	8	0	We cannot change the South Park flag, Mayor!	[]
Chef	15	0	Mayor, as I've said before, I find that flag to be racist and insensitive!	[]
Other	31	0	Chef, I respect you very much, but you have to understand that this has been the South Park flag since some of our ancestors, like my great-grandfather, founded this land!	[]
Chef	21	0	That flag represents a time when blacks were persecuted by whites! How can a black man not be bothered by it?!	[]
Other	22	0	Ahalright, Chef, I'll have my assistants hold up the flag.  and you tell me what exactly you find racist about it.	[]
Chef	9	0	You don't see anything wrong with that flag?!	[]
Other	19	0	Chef, what about the baseball team, the Cleveland Indians, huh? Should they change their name because it's racist?	[]
Chef	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Other	6	0	No, because it's their history!	[]
Chef	30	0	Look, I have gone to every quiet protest I could! I have written everyone; I've put up signs! But now I'm telling you , THIS FLAG WILL BE CHANGED!	[]
Other	8	0	And I'm telling you it WON'T!	[]
Other	2	0	Oh, boy.	[]
Other	49	0	Okay, children, in Mr. Garrison's absence, I would like to turn the class's attention to current issues. Some people think the South Park flag should be changed, while others believe that changing the flag is wrong. I think this is a perfect subject for your debate club.	[]
Other	1	0	Aaaaah!	[]
Other	47	0	I see that you've already had a lot of interesting debates this year.  Pro-Choice vs. Cartman, Pro-Gun Control vs. Cartman, a-and People Against the Clubbing of Baby Seals vs. Cartman. And apparently, the winner of all your debates so far has been... Cartman.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Thaaat's ri-ight.	[]
Kyle	19	0	Cartman doesn't always win! He just gets pissed off and goes home so we can't debate anymore!	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Nah-ah! I'm just a better debater than you guys!	[]
Stan	13	0	You don't even know what you're debating about half the time!	[]
Cartman	3	0	Yes I do!	[]
Craig	4	0	No you don't!	[]
Cartman	10	0	Oh yeah?! Well, screw you guys, I'm going home!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Told ya.	[]
Other	36	0	Alright, children, well, unlike Mr. Garrison, I want you all to go out and research this debate before we pick teams. Tomorrow, you'll need to choose which side of this poignant debate you are on.	[]
Other	125	0	This is about history, kids.  If you don't have respect for your past, then you can never expect to- BIRD!  -then you can never expect to have a future. Nowadays, everyone wants to change mascots and flags because they're not  politically correct. Well, where does it end? I mean, people are gonna start sayin' that the Denver Broncos are offensive to horses. And then we'll have to- a SQUIRREL!  And then we'll have to change everything, and pretty soon all our history will be forgotten. But to REALLY understand the South Park's flag's importance, you need to know about South Park's history. Ned here's a big history buff, and he can tell you the whole story. Ned?	[]
Other	13	0	Nnneh, in 1867, fourteen pioneers from the East Coast traveled across the Plains-	[]
Stan	11	0	Uh that, that's okay, dude, I think we got it.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Yeah, we got it.	[]
Other	2	0	You sure?	[]
Other	1	0	Yup.	[]
Other	19	1	You boys go make me proud now and win that debate- Chris Peterson!  God-damnit, we missed him again!	['damnit']
Chef	43	0	Sign up to join me, and come marching to the Mayor's office in protest of the South Park flag!  You see that, children?! Nobody wants to get involved!  Randy! Sign up to march with me against the South Park flag on Wednesday?	[]
Randy	28	0	Oh, uuhh, look, Chef, you know I'm-m not a racist, but uh, I just don't really feel strongly one way or another about the flag.	[]
Chef	35	1	Well, alright, Marsh, you're entitled to your own opinion.  That's how it is in this town. I haven't gotten one signature on this damn sheet, and I've been here all day!	['damn']
Wendy	6	0	We'll march with you, Chef.	[]
Chef	20	0	That's nice, but I need the support of some registered voters.  Ey, Mackey! Sign up to march on Wednesday?	[]
Mr. Mackey	16	0	Oo, Wednesday? Uh-Wednesday's tough. I guess- maybe I could do somthin' uh, Thursday afternoon.	[]
Chef	9	0	Alright, fudge it, Thursday. Anyone else wanna go Thursday?	[]
Other	9	0	Thursday's no good, we've got choir council.	[]
Mr. Mackey	2	0	Oh, yeah.	[]
Other	4	0	What about next Sunday?	[]
Chef	3	0	Fine! Next Sunday!	[]
Other	6	0	You mean, during the ball game?	[]
Other	7	0	Oh, yeah. We can't do Sunday.	[]
Chef	1	0	Monday??	[]
Other	6	0	Oh, I can't do Monday.	[]
Other	4	0	I could do Tuesday.	[]
Mr. Mackey	5	0	Yeah, Tuesday morning's good.	[]
Other	11	0	You know what would be better for me is Saturday afternoon.	[]
Other	5	0	Saturday is perfect for me.	[]
Other	7	0	Yeah. How about Saturday at 11:30?	[]
Other	2	0	Mm hmm.	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Other	3	0	That sounds good.	[]
Other	2	0	Mm hmm.	[]
Mr. Mackey	8	0	Yeah, I think that's the best day.	[]
Chef	5	0	Okay! On Saturday, we march!	[]
Other	7	0	Oh, march? What are we marching for?	[]
Chef	7	0	To bring down the South Park Flag!	[]
Other	1	0	...Oh.	[]
Other	4	0	Oohh, I gotta go.	[]
Other	11	0	I know what I may like. I don't like marching	[]
Other	7	0	Uh, marching's really not for me.	[]
Other	3	0	See you later.	[]
Other	31	0	Well I've counted up all your secret ballots, children, and it look like about half of you think the flag should stay, and half think the flag should be changed.	[]
Wendy	14	0	How could any of you think that flag should stay the way it is?!	[]
Other	28	0	Save it for the debate, Wendy. Now I'm going to assign the debate leaders. Who wants to lead the Flag Should Stay The Way It Is team?	[]
Other	4	0	Me. Me. Me. Me.	[]
Wendy	7	0	Stan?! How could you be so insensitive?!	[]
Stan	11	0	Whoa, dude, I don't see anything wrong with that flag.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Yeah, me neither.	[]
Other	39	0	Alright. Stan and Kyle,  you can both be the team leaders for the Flag should stay the way it is team.  Now, who wants to lead the Flag should be changed team?  Okay, Wendy and Eric can team up.	[]
Wendy	1	0	Nooo!	[]
Other	14	0	Alright, children. Do your homework, and let's get ready for a great debate!	[]
Other	2	0	Hello, Chef.	[]
Chef	12	0	My name isn't Chef anymore, children. I've converted to Islam.	[]
Stan	1	0	Islam??	[]
Chef	32	0	From now on, my name is  Abdul Mohammed Jabar  Rauf Kareem Ali.  With everyone in town so insensitive about the flag, I find it no longer fitting to use my slave name!	[]
Stan	21	0	Well, we need help with our debate club. We have to explain why we think the flag should not be changed.	[]
Chef	11	0	You WHAT?!  You don't think they should change the flag?!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Not really.	[]
Stan	10	0	Yeah, we don't see what the big deal is.	[]
Chef	38	2	Well, that figures you don't! Because your cracker-ass parents turned you into little cracker-ass cracker-racists! I never thought I'd live to see this many of the people I considered friends turn against me!	['ass', 'ass']
Stan	11	0	But Chef, we don't know what you're talking about.	[]
Chef	10	2	But nothin'!  But my ass! Fix your own damn food!	['ass', 'damn']
Wendy	44	0	Okay. Now, in order for us the debate to change the South Park flag, we will need to do a lot of research. Now, my plan is to divide up into three research teams. We will present our arguments based on things that w-	[]
Cartman	6	0	It's okay, I'm here.	[]
Wendy	16	0	Nice of you to show up! We were just discussing how we should state our case.	[]
Cartman	22	0	Yes. This is a difficult case. In order to win the debate, we will need to attack Stan and Kyle's credibility.	[]
Wendy	1	0	What??	[]
Cartman	33	1	That's how you win these things: attack your opponents' credibility!  Butters! Take some kids and go dig up whatever dirt you can on Kyle's past. I'm talkin' booby magazines, whatever.	['booby']
Butters	3	0	Wwuhuh-o-kay!	[]
Cartman	37	0	The rest of you, go get the goods on Stan! His mom grounded him once for setting something on fire. Let's find out what that something was, and then lie and say it was a puppy.	[]
Clyde	1	0	Right.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Mmmm.	[]
Wendy	20	0	Cartman, we can't just attack Stan and Kyle's credibility. We need to present our side of the debate.	[]
Cartman	29	0	You're right. We'll need to look like we prepared a case, too, so that they look all the weaker. Good plan. Sooo, what's the issue again?	[]
Wendy	4	0	The South Park flag!	[]
Cartman	7	0	Interesting. Aaand, what side are we on?	[]
Wendy	2	0	D'aaaaahhh!	[]
Cartman	4	1	Whoa! Calm down, ho.	['ho']
Other	21	0	Tom, I'm standing out front of the South Park Mayor's Office, where both sides of this debate have gathered.	[]
Chef	3	0	Change the flag!	[]
Other	4	0	Don't change history!	[]
Other	4	0	Oh brother, what now?!	[]
Chef	6	0	Change the flag! Change the flag!...	[]
Other	8	0	Earlier, the South Park townspeople voiced their opinion.	[]
Other	17	0	Well, I think the flag is racist!  Huh, but then again, it is part of our history.	[]
Other	17	0	Well, I guess the flag is part of history, ...but I can see how it is racist.	[]
Other	10	0	I think it is history. I think it is racist.	[]
Other	20	0	Well, one things for sure, tensions are high and pressure is mounting on the South Park Mayor to do something.	[]
Chef	45	0	...Change the flag! Change the flag! Change the flag! Change the flag!  In the 1960s there was a monk  who set himself on fire to protest! You have left me no choice!  To protest your lack of humanity, I will now do the same thing!	[]
Other	2	0	Huh! Haaaaaaaaaaaah!	[]
Other	14	0	White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power!	[]
Other	18	0	What's this? Uh, Tom, it looks as if the KKK have shown up to express their opinion.	[]
Other	10	0	Hello, brother.  We are here to support your noble cause.	[]
Other	19	0	Huh? Uh hey now, uh. We don't want your support. We're not racists; this is about history.	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Other	13	0	Well, whether you want our support or not, we're on your side!	[]
Other	16	0	White Power! White Power!  White Power! White Power!  White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power!	[]
Other	7	0	Mr. Garrison, you're a Klan member?	[]
Mr. Garrison	6	0	NO, no,  but Mr. Hat is.	[]
Mr. Garrison	4	0	White Power! White Power!	[]
Mr. Garrison	9	1	Ogh! You're such a racist bastard, Mr. Hat.	['bastard']
Other	2	0	White Power!	[]
Chef	3	0	Change the flag!	[]
Other	4	0	Don't change history!	[]
Other	5	0	Ooh, Jesus. What a mess.	[]
Other	54	0	Chef, we realize that you find the South Park flag racist, and we certainly understand your case.  We have been diligently working on this problem, put in a lot of hours, and we have finally altered the flag in a way that we think will make you very happy. Gentlemen?  There. Is that better?	[]
Chef	2	1	No, damnit!	['damnit']
Other	47	0	No, but look! He's got a little smile now!  See? He's happy. Much better, don't you think?  Well, some people just won't work with you at all. This is getting out of hand. How do I absolve myself of an responsibility with this?	[]
Other	18	0	Mayor, the-ee South Park Elementary children are discussing the flag issue in their debate club on Friday.	[]
Other	15	0	We... could use the debate as an excuse to hold a vote on the issue.	[]
Other	24	0	Yes, of course. Let the children be responsible. Everybody loves children. Tell the press. South Park Elementary will be holding a vote on Friday!	[]
Wendy	24	0	This might come in handy. It says here that recently a case was brought before the South Carolina Court about their flag, and they-	[]
Cartman	23	1	I warn you, Bog Monster! Do not mock Captain Candycone! O yeah?! How would you like I should kick you in the nuts?!	['nuts']
Wendy	11	0	If we could show a parallel between the South Carolina case-	[]
Cartman	25	3	Ugh. Oh yeah?! I'll kick you in the nuts! Ugh. I'll kick you in the nuts! I'll kick you in the nuts!	['nuts', 'nuts', 'nuts']
Wendy	13	0	Cartman, why don't you just go home?! You aren't helping any!	[]
Cartman	6	0	You won't let me help.	[]
Wendy	11	0	That's because you're stupid, and you're a racist!	[]
Cartman	40	0	...Touche. But dude, you might as well let me help you. We're in this together. I mean, just... tell me what to do, and I'll do it.  Wendih, let Cartman help. Seriouslih.  Wendih. Seriouslih.  The Bog Monster speaketh.	[]
Kyle	23	0	Okay. since my dad's a lawyer, he says we can use any of his books we want.  Who wants to read them?	[]
Stan	11	0	Come on, you guys. We all have to work on this!	[]
Kyle	13	0	Kenny, how many of my dad's mints are you gonna eat? Jesus!	[]
Kenny	8	0	(Plenty. This is 'cause my family's poor.)	[]
Kyle	19	0	I know your family's poor, but you can't just eat an entire bowl of mints for dinner.	[]
Kenny	3	1	(Ah, fuck you!)	['fuck']
Stan	18	0	I don't think we stand a chance in this debate, 'cause Wendy's leading the other side.	[]
Kyle	11	0	Dude, you're just saying that because she's your girlfriend.	[]
Kenny	8	0	(Hey, can I have a drink of water?)	[]
Kyle	13	0	Yeah, you can have a drink of water. The dispenser's over there.	[]
Stan	9	0	Yeah, you must be thirsty after eating 60 mints.	[]
Other	7	0	Hey, boys, how's the research coming?	[]
Kyle	4	0	Pretty good, I guess.	[]
Stan	8	0	Do you think they should change the flag?	[]
Other	6	0	Oh, uuhh. I don't know.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Kenny ate all the mints, dad.	[]
Other	9	0	Oh, those weren't mints, those were antacid tablets.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Oh.	[]
Other	1	0	Kenny!	[]
Kenny	3	0	(What?)  (Oh oooooooOOOOOOOH!)	[]
Stan	5	0	That was a good one.	[]
Other	4	0	White Power! White Power!	[]
Other	12	0	Do not change the flag! It is a symbol of white power!	[]
Other	2	0	White Power!	[]
Mr. Garrison	14	1	Oohh, I'm sorry, Chef. Mr. Hat is a racist son of a bitch.	['bitch']
Mr. Garrison	8	0	Don't apologize for me to that spearchucker!	[]
Mr. Garrison	3	0	Dugh!  Ogh. Waaaaah!	[]
Chef	13	0	How can you all just stand by and let these racists do this?!	[]
Other	20	0	Well, Chef, it's freedom of speech. We don't like it, but we can't arrest them for talking.	[]
Other	19	0	Should the Klan be allowed to rally on the steps of the Capitol? Here's what some people think.	[]
Other	15	0	Well, I think they are racist, but I... do think freedom of speech is important.	[]
Other	18	0	Well, I, for one, believe in freedom of speech. ...Mmm but then again, I think they are racist.	[]
Other	13	0	Well, I believe that they are racist, but I do believe that all-	[]
Chef	9	2	Aw, the hell with all of you indecisive bastards!	['hell', 'bastards']
Other	47	0	On Friday, South Park Elementary will present its debate, and after the debate, there will finally be a vote. Preliminary polls show three in favor of changing the flag, three against changing the flag, and 4382 undecided. Z So the pressure in on those South Park kids!	[]
Other	15	0	Well, that's enough rallying for this afternoon, members. Let's take a hot shower!	[]
Other	6	0	Hot shower! Hot shower! Hot shower!	[]
Other	27	0	Ned, nobody's gonna vote for our side if it's the side those KKK members are on. Come on, we gotta put a stop to them.	[]
Wendy	25	0	I can't believe it. All the pressure's on us. I mean, this debate is going to actually affect the outcome of the vote.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Uh huh.	[]
Wendy	14	0	Oh man, we've got to come up with rebuttals to the history argument.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Why don't we just talk about the swastika?	[]
Wendy	1	0	Huh?	[]
Cartman	29	0	I mean, Germany was united under the swastika, right? But,... obviously history wasn't as important as changing the views after the war and stuff, so hey changed it.	[]
Wendy	8	0	Hey, that's a pretty good point, Cartman.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Wendy	11	0	Not bad at all. I may make that our first argument.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Cool.	[]
Wendy	6	0	Double-stuffed cookies are my favorite.	[]
Cartman	29	0	Really? Mine too. What I really like to do, is I like to take the tops off of two cookies, and then put them together and make quadruple stuffs.	[]
Wendy	8	0	Hey, that's what I always do, too!	[]
Cartman	2	0	No way!	[]
Wendy	14	0	Yeah. Jesus, I never thought I'd have anything in common with you, Cartman.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Me neither.	[]
Wendy	2	0	Aha ha.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Huh.	[]
Other	8	0	Well, anyway, let's get back to work.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Whoa.	[]
Wendy	23	0	Weird, um. Okay. Uh. Now, let's say that first we talk about the history of the flag.  We can show that the-	[]
Cartman	5	0	Ur, s-sorry.  Go ahead.	[]
Wendy	4	0	No.  You go ahead.	[]
Mr. Garrison	9	0	Mr. Hat, what do you think you're doing?	[]
Mr. Garrison	14	0	There's another Klan rally tonight; I have to be there in 15 minutes.	[]
Mr. Garrison	12	0	Ooh no, Mr. Hat. You are not dragging to another Klan meeting.	[]
Mr. Garrison	15	0	But they're electing a new assistant to the Grand Dragon. I might get elected.	[]
Mr. Garrison	14	0	Well, good for you, Puppet Pants! I'll have nothin' to do with it!	[]
Mr. Garrison	9	0	I'm going whether you like it or not!	[]
Mr. Garrison	25	0	Oh yeah?!  I'm not going, Mr. Hat, and that's final!  Let's just see you try and go without me!  Mi-Mr. Hat?	[]
Other	16	0	White Power! White Power! White Power!  White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power!	[]
Other	17	0	Alright, Ned. We've got to be careful. These are really evil men we're dealing with.	[]
Other	2	0	Mmm-okay.	[]
Other	10	1	Damnit Ned, doesn't that thing have a volume control?	['damnit']
Other	1	0	No.	[]
Other	4	0	White Power! White Power!	[]
Other	21	0	Good evening, brothers. Our first order of business tonight is to have Brother Anderson update us on last week's minutes.	[]
Other	11	1	Last week we decided we hate blacks and Jews. A lot!	['jews']
Other	17	0	Alright. And now it's time for us all to come together, and... do our cake raffle.	[]
Other	3	0	Oh, cake raffle.	[]
Other	10	0	This week's winner is...  uh, 2 9 7 4.	[]
Other	8	0	I won, I won.  I won the cake!	[]
Other	3	0	God job, brother.	[]
Wendy	1	0	Cartman!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Ahh!	[]
Wendy	7	0	Say it'll be like this forever.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Okay, It will be like this forever.	[]
Wendy	2	0	Oh, Cartman!	[]
Wendy	15	0	AAAAAAaaaah!  Brrrrr. What's wrong with me?  Ahhh. It's okay. Get a grip, girl.	[]
Other	2	0	Wendih.  Wendih.	[]
Wendy	1	0	Aaaah!	[]
Other	4	0	Wendih, look at me.	[]
Wendy	9	0	Oh God, please don't let this be happening.	[]
Other	35	0	Alright brothers, listen up!  As you know, this fine city is holding a vote on whether or not to change their flag. But lynching minorities is history! So what are we gonna do about it?!	[]
Other	15	0	Let's say that if they change the flag, we'll burn down the Capitol!	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Other	15	0	Let's say that if they change the flag, we'll never leave this town!	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Other	8	0	Let's say they should change the flag!	[]
Other	2	0	Yeah!  Wah?	[]
Other	5	0	Uh what's that, brother?	[]
Other	6	0	I think we should switch sides!	[]
Other	8	0	Me too. Nnn-that's a good idea.	[]
Other	16	0	Look, we have to accept the fact that most people in the world hate us, right?	[]
Other	3	0	Yeah, m-hm.	[]
Other	14	0	So, whatever side we're on is the side that's gonna lose, right?	[]
Other	2	0	Right, yeah.	[]
Other	26	0	So why don't we all say that we want the flag changed. That way, most folks'll vote to keep it the way it is.	[]
Other	6	0	That's a great idea, brother!	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Other	23	0	Alright, it is decided! We will officially tell everyone that we want the flag changed, so that they will all vote against us!	[]
Other	2	0	Hooray, yeah!	[]
Other	3	0	We're smart!	[]
Other	4	0	That worked perfectly, Ned.	[]
Other	24	0	Well alright, now that that's out of the way, it is time to play, Whose got the silliest thing on under their robe?	[]
Other	2	0	Yeah, woohoo!	[]
Other	7	1	Jesus, Ned, these guys are completely nuts.	['nuts']
Other	2	0	Mm-yup.	[]
Other	53	0	That is the most insane thing I've ever seen. I can't believe those people are on our side. I mean, is our side that crazy?  Oh, hello, Chef. Big debate tomorrow, I guess.  Oh, Jesus, the robes! Chef, this isn't what it looks like. You've gotta listen to us!	[]
Chef	16	2	I ain't gonna listen to nothin'! This whole cracker-ass town can kiss my ass!	['ass', 'ass']
Other	14	0	Ned, I'm starting to think that maybe history ain't worth defendin' sometimes.	[]
Wendy	11	0	Thanks for coming over, Bebe. I have something to tell you.	[]
Bebe	2	0	Sure, what?	[]
Wendy	6	0	Bebe, I'm attracted to Cartman.	[]
Bebe	1	0	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!	[]
Wendy	2	0	I know.	[]
Bebe	12	0	Why would you tell me this? Why would you tell anyone this?	[]
Wendy	37	0	Because I don't know what to do. I can't concentrate, and if I can't concentrate, then I can't win the debate tomorrow. The whole vote is dependent on me doing a good job-	[]
Bebe	32	1	Alright, look. When two people work closely for a long time, sometimes they feel what's called, sexual tension. Sometimes you just have to act on impulse and get it over with.	['sexual']
Wendy	6	0	You mean, I should kiss him?	[]
Bebe	9	0	Kiss him and get it out of your system.	[]
Wendy	2	0	Oh God.	[]
Other	54	0	Well I certainly would like to thank all the parents for their support of our debate club.  I r-realize that many of you are torn by the issues as well, so, perhaps the children can shed some light on us. We'll start with Wendy Testaburger on the Flag Should Be Changed team.	[]
Wendy	31	0	The-  the- uh,  aheh ahum,  the... the- uh,  Ahhhhh,  The first argument we-  ah...  Let me start over.  The uh-  oh God. Could you all excuse me for a moment?  Mmmmmummmmeeemmeeemeeemmee...	[]
Other	1	0	Oh.	[]
Other	2	0	Oh, God!	[]
Wendy	42	0	There. Now, the main point we would like to make is oftentimes it is prudent to change history. As times change we hope to grow, and as we grow our rules must change. It is a natural part of evolution. Thank you.	[]
Other	10	0	Okay, and Kyle and Stan's team, your main point?	[]
Kyle	49	0	Our main point is that the flag shouldn't offend anyone, because killing has been around since the beginning of time. All animals kill.  And the animals that don't kill are stupid ones, like cows and turtles and stuff. So people should not be so upset about killing.	[]
Chef	9	0	Whoa whoa whooaa! You just missed the point entirely!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Huh?	[]
Chef	17	0	I'm not mad because the flag shows somebody gettin' killed, It's because it's racist!	[]
Other	1	0	Racist??	[]
Chef	25	0	Children, don't you even know what this argument is about?! That flag is racist because a black man is being hung by white people.	[]
Other	1	0	Ooooooohhh.	[]
Chef	1	0	Ooooooohhh?!	[]
Kyle	9	0	W-we really didn't see it that way.	[]
Chef	8	0	But that's a black man up there!	[]
Kyle	12	0	Y-yeah, but... the color of someone's skin doesn't matter.	[]
Chef	31	0	Well of course it matters when-  ...Oh my God. Wait a minute. You children didn't even see the flag as a black man being hanged by white people, did you?	[]
Other	1	0	No.	[]
Chef	13	0	Why, that is- that is the most beautiful thing I have ever heard.	[]
Other	1	0	What?	[]
Other	1	0	What?	[]
Chef	49	0	Don't you see? All this time I thought these little crackers had turned racist, when actually they were so not racist that they didn't even make a separation of black and white to begin with. All they saw when they looked at that flag was five people.	[]
Other	1	0	Awww.	[]
Other	1	0	Awww.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Chef	32	0	I'm sorry, children. I was wrong about you. But I still the flag needs to be changed. But now I realize that I almost let racism turn me into a racist.	[]
Other	22	0	Yeah. You know, uh I suddenly found myself on the side of Klan members. I've never had anything against blacks, Chef.	[]
Chef	20	0	Oh, I know you don't, Jimbo. I've known you for almost ten years. You're a good man.	[]
Other	25	0	We've been way too divisive over this, Chef. Maybe we can come up with a- compromise flag-something that everybody can be happy with.	[]
Chef	19	0	I think that's a much better start than me tryin' to separate myself from all you wonderful crackers.	[]
Other	3	0	Ooh, huhuh. Oooh	[]
Kyle	16	0	Oh. Sweet, dude. I don't think we have to do this stupid debate now.  Stan?	[]
Other	61	0	This has been an interesting week in South Park. We've all done a lot of growing this week.  Everyone was afraid to take a stand on this issue. But now we have learned once again that black, white, yellow, brown, or whatever, we are all just people. And so, I am very excited to unveil our new South Park Flag!	[]
Stan	6	0	Wait, I don't get it.	[]
Kyle	25	0	No, see? There's people of all colors. And they added a black guy as one of the hangers, too, so it's not racist.	[]
Chef	1	0	Hooray!	[]
Other	10	0	I have to admit it, that is a lot nicer.	[]
Wendy	9	0	Phew. I'm sure glad that's over with.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Me, too!	[]
Wendy	27	0	I can't believe how right Bebe was about feeling under pressure with somebody. As soon as it was over, all my feelings for you just vanished.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Oh, huh. Yeah. Yeah, totally huh.	[]
Wendy	9	0	I'm totally back to normal. See you later.	[]
Cartman	9	1	Yeah. See you later, heh. Ho,  huhuh, he, haha.	['ho']
Wendy	5	0	Hahaha.  Stan. Stan, wait up!	[]
