Randy	5	0	Hey! Shelly, whoa, stop, stop!	[]
Stan	11	0	Dad, you've gotta do something! She's out of control!	[]

Other	11	0	You don't know if there's any Internet in California.	[]
Randy	22	0	Well there certainly ain't none here! Look, maybe it's time you all face reality! The Internet here is dried up!	[]

Other	29	0	You and everyone else. You'll have to stay out at the transient camp with all the others heading to Californee.  It's about a mile down the road.	[]
Randy	33	0	I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad. I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad. I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad, oh Lordy., My Internet done up and went away.	[]
Other	6	0	Where are you from, old-timer?	[]
Other	20	0	Kansas City. Had me a store there. Kind of... computer supply store. When the Internet went, the stores went too.	[]
Other	22	0	Things will be different when we get out to Californee. Soon as we get us some Internet we can all rest easy.	[]
Other	22	0	Why sure, Silicon Valley. They gots a whole mess of Internet up there. 'Say a man can practically roll around in it.	[]
Other	30	0	When I get to that Internet I'm gonna click on just about everything in sight. 'Might even click on a pop-up ad just for the heck of it.	[]
Other	27	0	Well I'm gonna sit down at that Internet and just stahrt e-mailin'. Just keep on e-mailin' till my fingers are sore to the bone.	[]

Other	7	0	You folks all headin' to Silicon Valley?	[]
Randy	8	0	That's right. We need to get online.	[]
Other	5	0	Haha. Get online he says.	[]
Stan	6	0	What's so funny about that?	[]
Other	97	0	Think about it. How many folk headin' out to Californee? A million? More? And how much Internet you think they got out there?  Might be some Internet, sure, but with everyone tryin' to use it at once, it's gonna go real slow-like. I knows it 'cause I seen it. My two children, they tried to load a Web page. Took them over three days. They sat there waitin', and by the time the loadin' bar was only half-full they was dead.  Starve on the Internet, with a belly stuck out like a big bladder...	[]
Randy	8	0	Come on, Stan, let's get some rest.	[]
Other	6	0	Amiiir... I miss you so much...	[]
Stan	17	0	Don', don't cry, Shelly. You'll be able to get online when we get to Californee.	[]
Randy	9	0	Everyone, wake up!  We're here! Silicon Valley, Californee!	[]

Randy	5	0	So is there Internet here?	[]
Other	8	0	Stay in line and get to your campsite.	[]
Randy	8	0	Excuse me, we're looking for some Internet.	[]
Other	6	0	Yeah, they've got it here.	[]
Stan	2	0	All right!	[]
Other	28	0	But there ain't enough to go around. All they got is a little Internet.  Barely a bar a signal. So they have to ration it out, carefully.	[]
Other	23	0	Ya... sign up over there and use your time when they call your name. Each family gets 40 seconds o' Internet per day.	[]
Randy	11	0	Forty seconds? That ain't even long enough to check Wikipedia!	[]

Other	4	0	What did you say?	[]
Randy	16	0	Uh, you go ahead, Sharon. Divide some Internet amongst the children. I- gotta talk to somebody.	[]
Other	29	0	And that's about all we know. Uhh, there might be some Internet still in California and parts of Florida, though we certainly still don't have any here.	[]
Other	7	0	A fax! A fax is coming through!	[]
Other	4	0	Oh yeah, a fax!!	[]
Other	3	0	Oh a fax!	[]
Other	16	0	It's a fax, it's a fax! It's a fax, it's a fax!	[]
Other	9	0	It's a fax, we got a fax!  Uh-	[]
Other	18	0	Oh! it says, The government has sent their best people to the Internet in order to repair it.	[]
Other	10	0	We've gotta send a reporter out to the Internet!	[]
Kyle	4	0	Where... is... the Internet?	[]
Other	13	0	Gentlemen, the President is very angry that his Internet still isn't working.	[]
Other	21	0	We've tried everything, sir, but the Internet has slowed to a trickle and we can't get it working correctly.	[]
Other	12	0	Take me down below! I want to see the Internet for myself!	[]
Other	6	0	Here it is, general. The Internet.	[]

Other	17	0	Look, we're just tryin' to get by here. Everyone's gotta take what they can get.	[]
Randy	9	0	I haven't jacked off in over two weeks.	[]
Other	3	0	So jack off.	[]
Randy	49	0	You don't understand.  I need the Internet to jack off. I... got used to being able to see anything at the click of a button, you know? Once you jack off to Japanese girls puking in each other's mouths you can't exactly go back to Playboy!	[]
Other	22	0	What do you want us to do? Pick up the whole computer and put it inside for ten minutes just for you?!	[]
Randy	5	0	Three minutes would be plenty.	[]
Other	2	0	Get lost!	[]
Randy	1	0	Ohhh.	[]
Other	18	0	All right, each of you take a ticket. When they call your name you can use the Internet.	[]

Randy	5	0	Yeah, how'd you know?	[]
Other	32	0	Lots of us fellas came here for that reason. We all got used to seein' lots of really perverted stuff on the Internet, so now we can't go back to Playboy.	[]
Randy	3	0	I know, right?	[]
Other	18	0	Anyway, we got us a simulator. You just call out what you wanna see and then say click.	[]
Randy	3	1	Internet Porn Simulator	['porn']
Other	4	0	Give it a try.	[]
Randy	61	3	Uh, Japanese girls exchanging bodily fluids? Click.  Oh this sucks! I can't jack off to this!  Damn it.  Uhm, let's see. Interracial gangbang. Click.  Agh. Les-shemales! Let's try shemales. Click.  Bestiality? Click, click on that.  Ah, ah! Brazilian fart fetish porn?! Click! Click!  Dahya.  No. No, this isn't gonna work.  It's just not the same.	['damn', 'fart', 'porn']
Other	11	0	Well, sorry. And that'll be $49 on your credit card.	[]
Randy	9	0	Well at least that part's like the Internet.	[]
Other	14	0	We, we now have a reporter on the scene. Uhl-let's go live!	[]
Other	18	0	Tom, I'm at the Internet, where government officials are doing their best to get it running again.	[]
Other	38	0	All right, Internet. What do you want from us?   If we've angered you somehow, let us know.  Try to communicate with it digitally again.  I've had it with this thing! Fire a warning shot at it!	[]
Kyle	8	0	Hey, wait a minute.  Is it possible that...	[]
Other	4	0	What is it, Kyle?	[]
Kyle	7	0	I think... I know what's wrong.	[]
Other	13	0	This is taking too long! When do I get to use the Internet?!	[]

Randy	29	0	Oh. Uhh. There was a, there was a ghost! A-a-and-this, this ectoplasm!  Did you see the ghost?  It ran through here; it sli-it slimed me!	[]
Other	5	1	You son of a bitch!	['bitch']
Randy	11	0	Oh no it wasn't me, it was this spooky ghost!	[]
Other	53	1	This is our last chance. With nowhere else to turn, the government is going to allow one brave nine-year-old boy  to attempt his method to get the Internet running again.  It all comes down to this. Can the little Jewish boy reason with the Internet? Or will it be gone forever?	['jewish']
Other	4	0	All clear for procedure.	[]
Other	6	0	All right! Let's do it!	[]
Other	9	0	Look! The flashing yellow light is steady green now!	[]
Other	3	0	He did it!	[]
Other	4	0	I've got Internet!	[]
Other	2	0	Me too!	[]
Other	6	0	Internet activity in all sectors, sir.	[]

Other	3	0	Shelly. Shelly Marsh?	[]
Other	1	0	What?	[]
Other	4	0	It's me. Amir.	[]
Other	2	0	O... kay.	[]
Other	6	0	Your family came here too, huh?	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Other	16	0	So uhhh, I guess I'll e-mail you as soon as I get back home.	[]
Other	4	0	Yeah, okay. Sounds good.	[]
Other	4	0	Okay, s-see ya.	[]
Other	8	0	We're back togehhhther! We're back togehhhther!	[]
Randy	135	1	And so what have we learned through this ordeal? The Internet went away. It came back. But for how long we do not know. We cannot take the Internet for granted any longer. We as a country must stop over-logging -on. We must use the Internet only when we need it. It's easy for us to think we can just use up all the Internet we want. But if we don't treat the Internet with the resPECT  that it deserves, it could one day be gone forever. So let us learn to live with the Internet, not for it. No more browsing for no apparent reason, no more mindlessly surfing on our laptops while watching television. And finally,  We must learn to only use the Internet for porn twice a day. Max.	['porn']
