Kyle	12	0	But he's just using his time on television to rant about-	[]
Other	7	0	Kyle please, It is not your turn!	[]
Cartman	44	1	You are a race of beady-eyed thieves, Kyle, who throughout the millennia have squirmed and worked your way into the dark cubbyholes of society.  Where exactly did the Jews first get their power and how are they able to manipulate our minds today?	['jews']

Other	3	0	Shut up, Mimsssyyy!	[]
Cartman	45	1	If in fact the Jews truly are shapeshifters, and I believe I've presented enough evidence here to prove that they are, then we must unite as a species to fight them and stop their plan of global domination and the control of our freedom.	['jews']
