Stan	10	0	Look, you guys, maybe it's not all that bad.	[]
Craig	18	0	Not all that bad? How could you say that?! You hate this game more than any of us!	[]
Stan	25	0	I know, but listen: the finals are all sudden-death elimination, right? That means as soon as we lose one game, our season is over.	[]

Kyle	7	0	We're so proud of you kids!	[]
Cartman	9	0	What happens if we win the State Championship game?	[]
Other	21	0	Well, then your whole season starts over, but on the national circuit! You get to spend your whole summer playing baseball!	[]
Kyle	1	0	What?	[]
Other	11	0	You could do it, kids! We know you can win State!	[]
Other	15	0	Then we'll spend the whole summer going to Nebraska, and to Iowa, and Wyoming.	[]
Stan	5	0	Oh no. No, no, no!	[]
Stan	6	0	Dad? Dad, we need to talk.	[]

Other	24	0	Tom, I'm standing here with the little sluggers and some of their parents, and I can't tell you how excited they are.	[]
Stan	11	0	I don't suppose you guys want to win this game.	[]
Other	9	1	Win? Why the hell would we want to win?	['hell']
Other	12	0	Yeah. Then we'd have to play this boring game all summer.	[]
Other	26	0	Little Stan Marsh is the pitcher for the South Park Little League team, and Stan, how does it feel to be playing for the State Championship?	[]
Stan	1	1	Gay.	['gay']
Other	10	0	Mr. Marsh, you must be very proud of your son.	[]
Randy	29	0	They've worked really hard to get here, Chris, and, you know, I don't like to really trash-talk, but, I don't think Denver has a chance.	[]
Other	18	0	Oho, well, I'm sure some of the Denver kids' parents would disagree with you and your team-	[]
Other	29	0	Oh yeah! Oh yeah!  South Park is goin' down! Feel it comin'!  You ain't got a chance, South Park! Here we go, Denver, here we go! Huh, huh!	[]
Other	3	0	Who's that?	[]
Other	29	0	That's Tom Nelson, one of the Denver players' fathers. He goes to every game in that ridiculous outfit and usually drinks too much and gets into a fight.	[]
Other	19	0	There ain't no way some little mountain kids can beat Denver. Not with my son on second base!	[]
Other	16	0	Oho, looks like we got some parental trash talking going on here. Mr. Marsh, any comments?	[]
Randy	8	0	Well I think that there's a uh...	[]

Randy	3	0	Oh my God.	[]
Other	7	0	Good luck! You're gonna need it.	[]
Other	10	0	Yeah, you can't lose to us. We're terrible.	[]
Kyle	12	0	Dude, what are we gonna do? We can't win this game.	[]
Cartman	29	0	Wiat. I've got it, you guys. A fifth point in a sports movie, the team always goes out and finds a really sweet player to join their team.	[]
Clyde	8	0	Like that motorcycle kid in Bad News Bears.	[]
Cartman	19	1	Exactly right, Clyde. So what we need... is to find somebody to join our team, who totally sucks ass.	['ass']
Stan	21	0	Hey yeah. We need to find the very worst kid athlete in the whole world. Somebody who can't possibly win.	[]
Craig	2	0	But who?	[]
Kyle	3	0	I know who.	[]
Other	12	0	Announcing the arrival of flight six seven three, from New York City.	[]
Other	3	0	I'm baaack!	[]
Kyle	21	0	There he is! Now, don't let him know we think he's a loser, or else he won't play.	[]
Other	22	0	Hello, cousin Kyle. Oh Jesus, that flight was terrible. They served a chicken dish with hot sauce and it gave me gas.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Dude, thanks for helping us out by joining our team.	[]
Other	46	0	Well, you said you needed my help to win the big game, so here I am. I'll need a wipe cloth if I'm gonna play, though. Sometimes I sweat from holding the bat for so long and then the heat steams up my glasses.	[]
Craig	3	0	He's perfect.	[]
Stan	12	0	Yeah, with him on our team, we don't stand a chance.	[]
Randy	5	0	...I'm not gonna go.	[]
Other	1	0	What?	[]
Randy	12	0	Stan's little league game, I'm... I'm not gonna go.	[]
Other	1	0	Why?	[]
Randy	9	0	I just... don't think I can, all right?	[]
Other	25	0	You don't think you can?! This is the biggest game of your son's life! Wny wouldn't you go and support him? What-?	[]
Randy	41	0	Because I'm scared, all right?!  You wanna break me down?! You wanna hear me say it?! I'm scared! I don't know if I believe in myself anymore.  I don't know if I can take this guy, Sharon.	[]
Other	24	0	So then, don't. You don't have to get in fights with other parents at Little League games! Just sit there and watch!	[]
Randy	29	0	Look, I get what you're trying to do. You're trying to get me to realize that I have to fight him because it's who I am.	[]
Other	21	1	No, I'm telling you you don't have to get thrown out of games and make an ass of yourself.	['ass']
Randy	21	0	I've lost the edge. I'm sorry, Sharon. But you have to take Stan to his Little League game alone.	[]
Other	25	0	Welcoem to the Colorado Little League State Championship Game!  This must be pretty exciting for these youngsters. A chance to go to the national circuit.	[]
Other	13	0	You know what these guys look like to me? A bunch of winners!	[]
Other	9	0	Yeah! We're about to get our asses kicked!	[]
Cartman	18	0	I don't think so! You guys are way too good! You're the best at this game!	[]
Other	4	0	You're the best!	[]
Kyle	17	0	You guys are so good you'll probably go all the way to win the national title!	[]
Other	12	0	Not a chance, 'cause we're gonna lose to you right now!	[]
Other	16	0	Here we go, Denver! These South Park kids got nothin' on you! Let's go, Denver!	[]
Other	5	0	Chris, will you sit down?	[]
Other	9	0	First up to bat for South Park, Kyle Schwartz.	[]
Other	4	0	Where do I stand?	[]
Other	4	0	R-right over here.	[]
Other	16	0	Don't throw the ball too fast, because I might get startled and I have asthma.	[]
Other	2	0	Strike 1!	[]
Other	3	0	Yeah! All right!	[]
Other	14	0	Jesus, not so close! That was three feet from hitting me in the head!	[]
Other	7	1	He's not gonna swing! Throw balls!	['balls']
Other	2	0	Oh Jesus!	[]
Other	2	0	Strike 2!	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Stan	6	0	Wow, he IS great at sucking.	[]
Cartman	8	0	We're gonna lose! We're gonna lose!	[]
Other	22	0	Don't throw it so hard or so close next time! Is it cold out here? I think I need a jacket.	[]
Other	4	0	It's a bunt!	[]
Other	3	0	Run kid, run!	[]
Other	2	0	Oh Jesus!	[]
Kyle	2	1	Aw crap!	['crap']
Other	16	0	I can't, I can't keep running like this! I have corns in my feet!	[]
Other	3	0	Keep running, kid!	[]
Other	11	0	Throw the ball to third, you idiots! He's runnin' home!	[]
Other	1	0	Safe!	[]
Other	13	0	Oh Jesus, did you see that? I hit a homerun! High-five, everybody!	[]
Kyle	14	0	Oh my God... their pitcher was able to hit him right on the bat.	[]
Stan	27	0	Dude, we had it all wrong. While we spent all our time trying to make our tean suck, these guys practiced and got really good at sucking.	[]
Token	1	0	No!	[]
Other	4	0	Yeeaahh! Go Token go!	[]
Other	9	0	All right, Denver! You're up to bat now!	[]
Other	1	0	Out!	[]
Other	1	0	Yaaay!	[]
Kyle	21	0	Jesus Christ! They can bat themselves out!  Our whole summer, dude. We have to play this boring game all summer long.	[]
Butters	4	0	Son of a biscuit!	[]
Other	20	0	It's the bottom of the last inning here at Coors Field; the score is South Park 23, Denver 0.	[]
Other	2	0	Strike 1!	[]
Other	13	0	Come on, Denver! Get the lead out! Do not cross the Bat Daaad!	[]
Other	9	0	Geez I really wish this guy would shut up.	[]
Other	14	0	Why don't you just go home, South Park? You can't beat Denver!	[]
Other	18	1	Denver sucks ass!  Come on, South Park! These kids can't play! In fact, these kids are terrible!	['ass']
Other	2	0	Strike 2!	[]
Other	17	0	Oh Jesus, we're gonna win! I I never won a sport before; this is so exciting.	[]
Randy	9	1	It's over, Denver! South Park whupped your ass!	['ass']
Other	12	0	You'd better shut your mouth before I shut it for you!	[]
Randy	6	0	What do you wanna do, huh?	[]
Stan	6	0	This can't get any worse.	[]
Other	12	0	Now for the finishing move! You're about to be Bat-Dadded!	[]
Other	39	0	It all comes down to this! South Park is just one pitch away from being State Champions.  Oh geez, it looks like two parents are fighting. They'd better be careful. The Little League has a no-tolerance policy.	[]
Other	10	0	Stop! Stop, or you're gonna get your teams disqualified!	[]
Stan	4	0	Disqualified?  Fight! Keep fighting!	[]
Other	19	0	Break it up! Break it up!  That's enough! The next person that fights is getting his team disqualified!	[]
Other	5	0	He's done for anyway.	[]
Stan	5	0	Come on, Dad! Get up!	[]
Kyle	6	0	Get up! You have to fight!	[]

Other	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Other	1	0	Aww!	[]
Other	10	0	South Park has been disqualified from the game! Denver wins!	[]
Other	3	0	We... We lost.	[]
Randy	8	0	What? I thought this was a free country!	[]
Stan	5	0	Dad!  You're the greatest.	[]
