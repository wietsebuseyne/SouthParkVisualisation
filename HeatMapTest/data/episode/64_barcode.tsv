Kyle	6	0	Come on. Throw the football, Ike.	[]
Ike	3	0	No on dahdo.	[]
Stan	9	0	Dude!  You're not gonna believe what Cartman has!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Hepatitis B?	[]
Cartman	10	1	No, dickhole. Four tickets, 28th row, for the Raging Pussies!	['dickhole']
Kyle	5	0	...You got Raging Pussies tickets??	[]
Stan	14	0	We're going tomorrow night! Cartman's got the bus schedule all figured out!	[]
Kyle	7	0	Hold on. I'll be right back.	[]
Kyle	13	0	Mom, Dad, can I go with the guys to see the Raging Pussies?	[]
Other	2	0	No, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	6	0	But all the guys are going!	[]
Other	13	0	Kyle, you're not old enough, and those concerts are dangerous and vile.	[]
Kyle	3	0	But Mom, I-	[]
Other	5	0	The answer is no, Kyle!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Ugh!	[]
Kyle	7	0	My parents said I can't go.	[]
Stan	10	0	Well, of course your parents said you can't go!	[]
Cartman	50	0	Dummy, you don't ask if you can go! I'm telling my parents I'm staying at Stan's house, Stan's telling his parents he's staying at Kenny's house, and Kenny's not telling his parents anything, 'cause they're alcoholics and they don't care!	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Yeah!)	[]
Kyle	7	0	Ah. Oh, now I already told them.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Well, I guess you're screwed, then.	[]
Kyle	19	0	No! It's alright! Just give me some time to work on them. I'll see you guys later.	[]
Kyle	18	0	...But what if I do a bunch of chores around the house? Come on, you're being unfair!	[]
Other	25	0	Alright. Fine, Kyle, you can go to the Raging Pussies concert if you clean out the garage, shovel the driveway and bring democracy to Cuba!	[]
Kyle	3	0	What's Cuba?	[]
Other	10	0	A communist country run by a dictator named Fidel Castro.	[]
Kyle	17	0	And do I have to shovel the whole driveway, or just the side the car is on?	[]
Other	3	0	The whole thing.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Hoh, geez.	[]
Kyle	16	0	Dear Mr. Castro:  I am an eight-year-old American boy who lives in South Park.	[]
Kyle	97	0	And if I had just one wish, just one wish in the whole world, If I had one wish it'd be for Cuba to change. Because I think that all the Cubans are in pain All the joy in the world, from sea to shining sea Doesn't mean a thing if Cubans aren't free I just can't be very happy, that's certain Not as long as your Cubans are hurtin'  Oh, won't you search your soul and find a way to change your mind? That is my one and only wish.	[]
Other	4	0	Llamen a todos junto!!	[]
Other	45	0	Once again, this does mark the end of Communism in Cuba. Cuban dictator Fidel Castro claims he was finally convinced by a young boy's letter.  Now the country is again open to American tourism.  Plans can finally resume for Knott's Berry Farm Cuba.	[]
Kyle	11	0	I did it! Now I can go to the Raging Pussies!	[]
Other	4	0	No you can't!	[]
Kyle	1	0	What??	[]
Other	33	0	Kyle, your mother and I don't want you going to the Raging Pussies concert! We gave you a chore that we thought was impossible. You weren't supposed to actually do it.	[]
Kyle	9	0	But I did! Ah, I brought democracy to Cuba!	[]
Other	14	0	We know, Kyle, but we just don't want you going to their concert.	[]
Kyle	9	0	But that's not fair! You lied to me!	[]
Other	17	0	Kyle, perhaps we handled this wrong, buh- but you need to understand that we don't want-	[]
Kyle	19	0	What I understand is that you totally screwed me over!! So why should I have to listen to you?!	[]
Other	5	0	Because we're your parents!	[]
Kyle	9	0	Well I wish I didn't have any parents!	[]
Other	1	0	Kyle!	[]
Kyle	12	0	It's so unfair! How can my parents do that to me?!	[]
Stan	12	0	Parents can be pretty cruel sometimes, dude. They get off on it.	[]
Kyle	11	0	They're evil! I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE ANY PARENTS!	[]
Cartman	10	0	Well, you... could make them... go away for a while.	[]
Kyle	1	0	How?!	[]
Cartman	15	0	Well, I mean, you... could... call the police and have them take your parents away.	[]
Stan	2	0	The police?	[]
Cartman	22	1	Yeah, I saw it on TV. All you gotta do is call the police and say that your parents both molestered you.	['molestered']
Kyle	3	0	What's that?	[]
Cartman	39	1	I don't know, but it works. When I wanted to get rid of my mom's last boyfriend, I just called the police, and said he was molestering me, and I haven't seen him for three months.	['molestering']
Kyle	5	0	Wow! Three months without parents!	[]
Kenny	4	0	(Wow, that is awesome!)	[]
Stan	8	0	But what do the police do to them?	[]
Kyle	13	0	Who cares? My parents deserve whatever they get. They're liars and cheats.	[]
Cartman	21	1	You have to make it convincing, though, when you call the police. You have to be like,  my parents molestered me.	['molestered']
Kyle	4	1	My parents molestered me.	['molestered']
Cartman	47	1	No, but you've gotta cry, like this:  My parents molestered me.  And then they'll say something like, Was it a good touch or a bad touch? and you say  Uh, it was a good touch or- no wait,  you say it was a bad touch.	['molestered']
Kyle	4	0	What's bad touch?	[]
Cartman	14	0	Something about a swimsuit - I don't remember, but you definitely answer bad touch.	[]
Kyle	4	1	Okay, molestered, bad touch.	['molestered']
Cartman	7	0	Yeah, And cry.  Oh, he's ready.	[]
Other	15	0	Oh my God, this isn't happening. I would never touch my children like that.	[]
Other	16	0	You do have the right to remain silent, ma'am. I suggest you use that right.	[]
Other	16	0	Ugh, please, just listen to me!  What about my children? Who will take care of them?	[]
Other	12	0	Oh, now you care?! They're going to live with their grandmother.	[]
Other	36	1	Their grandmother's been dead for three years.  You're not listening to me. Kyle, tell these people that your-  mother never raped you! Tell them! It's my fault. Say it! Tell them right now!!	['raped']
Other	9	0	They'll never be able to hurt you again.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Cool, thanks.	[]
Other	7	0	Alright, folks. Our work here is done.	[]
Other	1	0	Alright!	[]
Stan	15	1	Dude! Having no parents is awesome! I'm gonna say my parents molestered me, too.	['molestered']
Cartman	10	1	Hey, yeah! We should all say our parents molestered us!	['molestered']
Other	5	0	Yeah, uh huh, woo hoo!	[]
Other	9	0	The following hot presentation is for mature audiences only.	[]
Cartman	5	0	You guys! Come out here!	[]
Stan	4	0	What's going on?	[]
Cartman	3	0	Notice anything?  Watch.	[]
Kyle	1	0	...Nothing.	[]
Cartman	32	0	Yeah, nothing. There's not an adult left in town.  They've all been arrested, and the ones that weren't arrested have moved away because they're scared of being arrested	[]
Kyle	4	0	Not one adult left?	[]
Stan	10	0	...Then it's ours. The whole town. It's ours.	[]
Other	9	0	Oh, sweetie, I have no idea where we are.	[]
Other	17	0	I haven't seen a road marker for miles. What was the last highway we were on?	[]
Other	9	0	There has to be a town around here somewhere.	[]
Other	7	0	Maybe you're reading the map wrong.	[]
Other	9	0	Hey, it was your idea to take the backroads.	[]
Other	8	0	What the?  Oh no. No, no, no, no.	[]
Other	6	0	What's the matter with it?	[]
Other	26	0	I have no idea. Oh, we're gonna have to find some help quick. We're not gonna make it more than a couple of miles.	[]
Other	15	0	Oh, look! There's a town up ahead.  Smiley Town? That's a strange name.	[]
Other	16	0	Well, it'll have to do. It's probably the only town for a hundred miles.	[]
Other	4	0	Hello? Is anybody here?	[]
Butters	7	0	Hoh, hahh, can I- help you folks?	[]
Other	10	0	...Yes, we need a mechanic to look at our car.	[]

Butters	6	0	No, uh Craig's here, too.	[]
Other	2	0	Oh, good.	[]
Butters	10	0	But he's playing Spaceman right now. Huh. Hey, Craig!	[]

Other	37	0	Look we're in a bit of a spot here! I've got a very important job interview tomorrow morning in Breckenridge, so I have to get my car fixed fast! Is there another garage in town?	[]
Butters	2	0	Huuuhhhh, no.	[]
Other	10	0	How about a phone? Can we just use the phone?	[]
Butters	20	0	Phone here doesn't work. Haa-I'm afraid the only phone that does work... is over in Treasure Cove.	[]
Other	6	0	Fine! Can you take us there?	[]
Craig	8	0	You... sure you wanna go to Treasure Cove?	[]
Other	1	0	Yes.	[]
Butters	5	0	Uhh rrreeally are you sure?	[]
Other	1	0	Yes.	[]
Butters	9	0	Oh, alright then.  Uh, show 'em where it is.	[]
Craig	29	0	This is the end of Smiley Town. The only phone is somewhere in Treasure Cove. If you wanna find it, you're gonna have to cross the white line.	[]
Other	9	0	Well, can you help us find the phone, please?	[]
Craig	9	1	Hell no! I'm not crossing the white line.	['hell']
Other	2	0	Why not?!	[]
Other	17	0	Alright, let's just... go, Linda. I don't have time for Spaceman Spiff's little games.	[]

Other	10	0	What is that? WAAH What do you want from us??	[]
Other	17	0	Linda, it's a remote-controlled car.  Looks like maybe there's a little camera on it.	[]
Other	6	0	Mark, I don't like this.	[]
Other	7	0	Relax, Linda, everything's fine.  Ow.  Ow.	[]
Other	4	0	What is it?! Acid?!	[]
Other	6	0	No, uh, it's lemon juice.	[]
Other	5	0	Oh God! Are you blind?!	[]
Other	7	0	No, it just really, really, really hurts!	[]

Cartman	11	0	Parents?  Ah, you mean the birth-givers. They're not around.	[]
Other	10	0	No parents in the entire town? What happened to them?	[]
Cartman	18	0	Okay, see, I am the mayor of Smiley Town, and so I will ask the questions around hyah!	[]
Other	9	0	Look, just point us to a phone, kid, alright?	[]

Cartman	9	0	Butters, I need an ETA on the car, stat.	[]
Other	35	0	Alright, we've had just about enough here! That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen! I don't care what little games you kids wanna play, we just want outta here, alright?	[]

Cartman	17	0	So, it appears that you need me. Which is good, because... I need you, too.  Ringy-ding?	[]
Other	22	0	I have the job interview of my life in Breckenridge! Just tell me how to get to a phone or a car!	[]
Other	1	0	SpitBall!	[]
Cartman	50	1	Aaahh!  You sons of bitches!  You see what we're dealing with here. Tonight is Carousel. And they will try to kill one of us. Eh, you two seem to have the uncanny ability to cross the white line. If you help us, we'll get you what you need.	['bitches']
Other	7	0	Mark, are we doing the right thing?	[]
Other	16	0	Look! If getting the stupid book will get me a cell phone, I don't care!	[]
Other	15	0	I just don't know if you're dealing with these kids the right way.	[]
Other	21	0	Well, I told you I can't deal with kids, Linda! That's why I don't want to have children!	[]
Other	9	0	Hey, I think you'd make a great father.	[]
Other	24	0	Oh, let's not go through this again, Linda. D-  Look, here's the book they've been talking about-  it makes no sense.	[]

Stan	12	0	You guys, stop it!  Sorry about them. Kindergartners are kind of spazzes.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Other	5	0	Why are you doing this?	[]
Stan	7	0	How come you wanna help the fatass?!	[]
Other	1	0	Who?	[]
Kyle	4	0	The fatass. The mayor.	[]
Other	38	0	Look, I have the job interview of my life in less than-  -12 hours! I just need a phone, and he said he'd help me if I took your book so you couldn't... kill them anymore.	[]
Stan	31	0	You got foolied, outlander! We're the only ones with a working phone. And if you had taken our book, then it's one of us who dies tonight at Carousel!	[]
Other	15	0	Uh, how did this all happen? Why do you children live in this town alone?	[]
Kyle	13	0	Because we do. It was like this yesterday, and the day before that.	[]
Other	5	0	But what about before that?	[]
Stan	11	0	You mean in the before time? In the long, long ago?	[]
Other	1	0	Yes!!	[]
Stan	10	0	If we tell you, will you help us stop Fatass?	[]
Other	9	0	I'll do anything to get to a phone!	[]
Stan	15	0	Alright. Everybody gather round. We're gonna tell the story of the before time again.	[]
Other	3	0	The Before time.	[]
Other	6	0	The story of the before time.	[]
Stan	31	0	Way back, in the long long ago, we all lived by the birth-givers' laws. But the birth-givers were unfair. They made us go to bed early and eat broccoli.	[]
Other	3	0	Yuck, yuck, yuck.	[]
Stan	22	0	And so the fatass came up with a way to have all the birth-givers disappear. , by using the magic M word.	[]
Other	1	0	Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.	[]
Stan	20	0	Soon we were without power, water, or fresh food. But we tried to survive. Under the guidance of... the Provider.	[]
Other	2	0	Provider. Provider.	[]
Stan	54	0	The fatass and us disagreed on how to worship the provider. The fatass tried to make us follow his way by making himself the school principal. So we made ourselves the superintendents of school. But then he just made himself the mayor. The town split sides and that's when the Provider got angry.	[]
Other	1	0	Boo!	[]
Other	2	0	Bwack bwack!	[]
Other	1	0	Coosh!	[]
Stan	22	0	So now, every night, the Provider must be appeased at Carousel. We need their book so one of ours doesn't die.	[]
Other	2	0	Carousel, Carousel.	[]
Stan	26	0	We all know that one day, the Provider will set us free. Make everything like it was in the before time. In the long, long ago.	[]
Other	35	1	Ah-ah-ah-ah,let me get this straight: if I go get the fat kid's book on the other side of the white line, you'll show me where a cell phone is?	['fat']
Stan	3	0	Yes. No foolies.	[]
Other	2	0	No foolies.	[]
Other	44	1	No, uh, it's it's it's right out here. Come on.  Linda, I want you to just go back to the car and wait for me, alright? I'll go get that fat kid's book so I can use their phone.	['fat']
Other	4	0	Mark, I'm scared.	[]
Other	9	0	I know, but this will all be over soon.	[]
Other	10	0	Oh, Gerald, I haven't seen you for so long!	[]
Other	8	0	Hello, honey, how has prison been for you?	[]
Other	6	0	Oh, it's awful! Just awful.	[]
Other	20	0	Alright parents, let's all take our seats.  My name is Scott Evans, and I am a prison rehabilitation counselor.	[]
Randy	13	0	Uh, excuse me, but my wife and I honestly never touched our child.	[]
Other	4	0	Eh, neither did we.	[]
Other	4	0	We didn't, either.	[]
Other	118	2	Enough, enough!  Look, it's obvious we have a lot of emotional issues and personal demons to face here. During your prison time, you will all be spending one hour a day in therapy here with me. What I want you to do is learn to control those sick, sexual urges you have. Now we're gonna try an exercise: I'm gonna confront you with what you lust after most.  Alright parents, now I, I know this is difficult, but I want you to just look at this child. Just try to suppress your urges to rape him.  Just think about somethin' else. Think about clouds and beaches. Don't think about his supple, soft little body.	['sexual', 'rape']
Other	8	0	Oh, that's disgusting!!! Now, now stop this!!	[]
Other	5	0	Fight your urges, Mr. Broflovski!	[]
Other	6	0	I don't have any urges!	[]
Other	77	2	I can't help you if you won't admit you need help!! Now sit down!  Look, I know this is very difficult for all of you. Most of you are still in denial about what you've done! To you it seems you've never raped your children at all! But you did. Help meeee help youuuu.  Now let's try again.  Look at this young man. Just look. Don't rape. Fight it. Fight it!	['raped', 'rape']
Other	11	0	Oh God, God, please just let us out of this place.	[]
Butters	13	0	I think I found the problem, ma'am. A broken window roller-upper.	[]
Other	4	0	Oh no. NO!  Aaaah!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Where is your husband?	[]
Other	2	0	Uh, uh...	[]
Cartman	2	0	Seize her!	[]
Other	7	0	Alright, I got the book for you.	[]
Stan	2	0	Awesu-home!	[]
Other	8	0	Now, can I please have the cell phone?	[]
Kyle	6	0	Sure, outlander. I'll get it	[]
Cartman	1	0	Outlander!	[]
Cartman	14	0	Outlander! We have your woman! She still lives, outlander! Outlander, her blood was fair!	[]
Butters	8	0	Oo what the heck are you talkin' about?	[]
Cartman	4	0	Butters, calm down, alright?	[]
Other	15	1	Okay, so what are some other things that we can do besides molest our children?	['molest']
Other	3	0	See a movie?	[]
Other	18	1	Sure, see a movie's good.  We could see a movie instead of molesting our children. What else?	['molesting']
Other	3	0	Make a sweater?	[]
Other	13	0	Uh huh. I'll put ah, knitting, sewing.  Who's got another one?	[]
Other	2	1	Molest children?	['molest']
Other	12	1	Nonono, we're looking for things to do besides molesting our children.	['molesting']
Other	2	0	Oh. Fishing?	[]
Other	5	0	Fishing's good. Uh huh.	[]
Cartman	16	0	I believe you have something of ours, outlander! Give it back, or the female gets it!	[]
Other	1	0	Mmrrhhhh!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Heh, heheh.	[]
Other	2	0	Rrrmm-mmrrhh!	[]
Other	5	0	Give him the book back.	[]
Stan	12	0	No. If they have it, one of ours will die for Carousel!	[]
Cartman	11	0	We're running out of time! Hand our book over, quick!	[]
Other	10	0	Enough of this! You kids are all in big trouble!	[]
Cartman	3	0	The Provider awakes!	[]
Stan	23	0	It's time for Carousel! Haha, your side doesn't have its book, fatass! That means someone on your side is sacrificed tonight.	[]
Cartman	9	1	Aw, damnit! Alright.  It is decided.  Butters, your turn.	['damnit']
Butters	9	0	Oh, I'm gonna be sacrificed to the Provider!	[]
Other	8	0	Stop right there! Nobody's killing anybody tonight!	[]
Other	12	0	Be careful, Mark. They'll make you disappear with the M word.	[]
Cartman	12	1	Yeah, we'll call the police and say you molestered us, too.	['molestered']
Other	1	0	What?	[]
Butters	9	0	I'm here for you, Provider! Uh, take me!	[]
Other	24	1	Is that what happened to the adults here?! You lied to the police and said they molested you?! My God, they were your parents!	['molested']
Stan	1	0	Parents?	[]
Other	96	0	The birth-givers! Your birth-givers.  Don't you remember? They are your providers! Not some statue! And they're not up in some fantastical faraway land now.  They're in prison. Probably crying themselves to sleep, cold and lonely and... I'm sure missing you all very, very much.  Your birth-givers took care of you. That's what their laws and their rules were for, because they love you, and they didn't want you to end up living like... th-this!  He won't take care of you. Your parents... your... providers... will.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Parents. Mom. Dad.	[]
Butters	5	0	Oh boy, here it comes!	[]
Other	35	0	If you want things to be the way they were in the before time, in the long, long ago, you all need to call the police and tell them you lied about them M word.	[]
Stan	13	0	He's right, dude. Things were a lot better with our parents around.	[]
Kyle	24	0	Yeah. I guess their rules did have a point. Things have gotten a lot worse in the ten days since they've been gone.	[]
Other	11	0	Ten days?? It's only been ten days since they left??	[]
Cartman	3	0	Take him down.	[]
Butters	16	0	Hey, uh, what are you doin'?? Ha-I'm ready to give myself to Mr. Elway.	[]
Kyle	13	0	Here's our cell phone, dude.  Will you call the police for us?	[]
Other	12	0	Hey. Looks like you're not so bad with kids after all.	[]
Other	11	0	Yeah, I guess you're right. Maybe we should have some.	[]
Other	12	0	Yeah, right. After all this, I'm getting my tubes ties tomorrow!	[]
Stan	12	0	Come on, you guys! Our parents are gonna be back any minute!	[]
Kyle	24	1	Do you think they're gonna pissed at us for lying that they molested us and sending them all to jail for ten days?	['molested']
Stan	15	0	Well, they can't be too pissed off. I mean, we made them a banner.	[]
Other	2	0	Hey, kids.	[]
Stan	5	0	Hey, you guys came back!	[]
Kyle	8	0	Did you make it to your job interview?	[]
Other	17	0	Yeah. I got the job. You're looking at the new manager of Denny's in Breckenridge.	[]
Other	6	0	And I got my tubes tied.	[]
Other	1	0	Alright!	[]
Kyle	15	0	Well, thanks for everything, you guys. You really helped us see how important parents are.	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Butters	4	0	Hey! Here they come!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Mom! Dad!	[]
Other	1	0	Kids!	[]
Other	4	0	...Come here, come here.	[]
Other	7	0	Oh, Kyle. Ike, sweetie, you're OK.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Yeah. We're fine.	[]
Other	19	1	Kyle, we're so sorry for the horrible sexual abuse over the years. But we're all better now.	['sexual']
