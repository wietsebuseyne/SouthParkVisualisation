Other	111	1	Here in the more arid regions of Africa, the gold-coat lions are in the throes of mating season.  The male lion positions himself behind the female and prepares to insert his lionhood. Notice his large swollen balls.  The female lion relaxes her body and says hello to Mr. Winky.  The male lion is enticed by the female's supple breasts and firm backside.  Quickly and suddenly, the male is finished. Now he wants to be alone, so he kindly asks the female to leave. He promises he'll call her tomorrow. But the female doesn't leave. Nope, she's moving right in. Looks like the male lion... is screwed.	['balls']
