Stan	14	0	Was your dad in Scouts, Cartman? Oh yeah, you don't have a dad.	[]
Cartman	6	0	That's not funny! Jesus Christ!	[]
Stan	10	0	Are you excited for your first night of Scouts, Timmy??	[]
Other	2	0	Hyeah Timmay!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Yeah, he's excited.	[]
Butters	2	0	Hey, fellas!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Hey, Butters.	[]
Butters	23	0	Boy, am I glad to see you guys! There's lots of kids here from other schools, and I don't know anybody.	[]
Randy	19	0	Alright, boys, we're gonna head to the bar. We'll be back to pick you up at nine.	[]
Other	17	0	You boys just make sure to obey the scout leader now. He's the man in charge.	[]
Other	2	0	Hello scouts!	[]
Stan	6	1	Hey, it's Big Gay Al!	['gay']
Other	16	0	Hello, Stanley. I was happy to see you and your little friends' names on the list!	[]
Other	1	0	Timmay!	[]
Randy	6	0	You're the new scout leader?	[]

Other	1	0	Hooray!	[]
Stan	3	0	See ya, Dad!	[]
Other	54	0	Hey, are you parents gonna stand there all night? This meeting is for scouts only, you silly gooses.  Now, before we get started, scouts, I want to introduce you to someone very special here tonight. He's a brave little boy with disabilities who proves just by being here that Scouts are for everyone!	[]
Other	1	0	Timmay!	[]
Other	13	0	So let's all give a big round of applause to little... Jimmy!	[]
Other	3	0	Well hello everyone.	[]
Other	2	0	Ji- Jimmay?	[]
Other	24	0	Look! I'm not saying the new scout leader's a bad person, I just don't think he should be a scout leader!	[]
Randy	18	0	He got to where he is by being a good scout; maybe we should just leave him alone.	[]
Other	5	1	Well how gay is he?	['gay']
Other	5	1	He's really, really gay.	['gay']
Other	10	0	Well then, I don't want my boy there, either.	[]
Randy	7	1	So he's a homosexual. So what?	['homosexual']
Other	30	1	I have nothing against homosexuals either, Randy, but the big camping trip is next week! Are you sayin' you're fine with this guy campin' overnight, alone, with our boys??	['homosexuals']
Other	28	1	You know, boys emulate authority figures. Even if it doesn't turn them gay, they could end up all talk and all fem' and prancin' around like girls.	['gay']
Randy	4	0	Aw, that's ridiculous.	[]
Other	47	2	People, people, please! You're forgetting that homosexuality is a choice! As many of you know, I, myself, went through a... homosexual... phase. But the light of Christ showed me how to change. Just give me two hours with this man, and I can convert him back.	['homosexuality', 'homosexual']
Other	16	1	That's what you said about Peterson, and then you ended up having sex with him!	['sex']
Other	3	0	That's right.	[]
Other	2	0	You did.	[]
Other	40	0	And so that's how to make banana-nut muffins. And now, as a very special treat, our very special friend Jimmy is going to do what he loves most: Motivational standup comedy.  Let's give him a big hand.	[]
Other	67	0	Wow, what a great audience.  Well, just in case you were wondering, I do have a disability. I am totally happy with the way I was born, very much. I travel to different states and talk to kids about being proud of what they are. My mom says that God has a p-plan for everyone. I guess I was plan B.  You guys like im- personations?	[]
Other	1	0	Timmy.	[]
Other	24	0	How about Jimmy Stewart? Merry Christmas, movie house. And John Travolta. Oh my God, Mr. Kotter! Mr. Kotter, oh, oh my God, Mr. Kotter!	[]
Stan	4	0	Jimmy's funny, dude.	[]
Butters	12	0	Yeah, well, he's the coolest kid with disabilities in the world!	[]

Other	7	0	Uh, Kenny, it's nine o'clock.	[]
Randy	3	0	Come on, Stanley.	[]

Cartman	13	0	Yeah, we learned how to make cakes and muffins for our bake sale.	[]
Stan	25	0	And best of all, we met this kid named Jimmy. He's disabled, but he doesn't let it ruin his life! He's awesome!	[]
Other	1	0	Yahahah!!!	[]
Cartman	14	0	Yeah, we're gonna use him to help raise money in our bake sale.	[]
Stan	10	0	Cartman, don't say use him, you big silly goose.	[]
Other	1	0	Ah.	[]
Randy	4	0	What did you say?!	[]
Stan	14	0	I just... called Cartman a name- he's a, he's a silly goose.	[]
Other	2	0	Uh huh!	[]
Randy	16	1	You do not say Big silly goose! You call him an asshole like a normal kid!	['asshole']

Other	48	0	Wow, what a great audience. I just flew into South Park. Boy, are my crutches tired!  What a terrific audience. You know, sometimes people ask me, Are you angry at God for making disabled people? I say, No, I think the world is better with puh-President Bush.	[]
Other	5	0	What a brave little boy.	[]
Other	13	0	He's able to use comedy to overcome his handicap! I love him!	[]
Other	34	3	Well, I sure have met a lot of interesting people here in South Park.  H-how about that Eric Cartman kid, huh? Goddamnit! God-. No, Kitty, that's my pot pie! Goddamnit! Eh, Goddamnit!	['goddamnit', 'goddamnit', 'goddamnit']
Cartman	7	0	Hehe, I don't sound like that.	[]
Other	108	2	And how about that school counselor? Uh, dr-, drugs are b-bad.  Uh. Drugs are bad, okay? Uh, drugs are, drugs are bad, okay? Okay?  Wow, what a great audience. Mr. Hat. Be quiet, Mr. Hat. Mr.-  Hello there, children. Mr. Hat. Hello- Mr. Hat  I'm making Salisbury steak for lunch.  Salisbury steak for lunch. Eh. Uh. Goddamnit, Goddamnit!  And of course, my very favorite, Timmy! Huh.

Other	8	0	Jim-my! Jim-my! Jim-my! Jim-my	[]
Other	2	0	Tiiimm-mmah!!!!!	[]
Other	25	0	Well, this is it. We've simply gotten too many complaints from concerned parents about him. I'm afraid we don't have a choice.	[]
Other	3	0	Hi ya fellas!	[]
Other	5	0	How are you today, Scout?	[]
Other	30	0	I'm super, thanks for asking. The troops are off having bake sales, and I'm pleased to report that we have already raised over $600 for the event. Yippie!	[]
Other	15	2	Uh, Big Gay Al, it's recently come to our attention that you are... gay.	['gay', 'gay']
Other	14	0	Well, stop the presses. Did you figure that out all by yourselves, silly buns?	[]
Other	16	1	Yes, well, unfortunately for you, the Scouts have a policy that openly gay men cannot belong.	['gay']
Other	17	0	We are left with no options, Mr. Al. I'm afraid you are hereby... out of Scouts.	[]
Other	3	0	Out of... Scouts?	[]
Other	6	1	We're sorry, Mr. Gay Al.	['gay']
Other	18	0	But I've been in Scouts since I was nine - it's a... huge part of my life.	[]
Other	26	1	Uh, you must understand that Scouts is a private club. A club that follows certain beliefs, and one of those beliefs is that homosexuality is immoral.	['homosexuality']
Other	2	0	I see...	[]
Other	6	0	It's nothing against you personally	[]
Other	11	1	What if I promise not to be gay anymore?  Pinky swear.	['gay']
Other	9	0	We think it's best you just... move on.	[]
Other	3	0	Right. Move on.	[]

Other	1	0	Timmih!	[]
Other	49	0	... Gee, you didn't have to do that. I mean, I understand why you've been jealous of my talent.  If you work at it, maybe you could be as... handi-capable as I am, huh?  Wow, a parka.  You-you didn't have to do that, Tim-Tim.	[]
Other	2	0	Tim-Timmy.	[]
Other	23	0	Oh, sure. I'll see if it fits.  This is very warm. Thanks a lot, Tim-Tim. Well, I'll see you around.	[]

Other	2	0	Tim-Timmay!	[]
Other	9	0	Ah, bye, Scouts.  Okay, okay, Marc, stop playing now.	[]
Other	27	0	Hey, don't yell at me! Ya asked me to come over and play sad songs for you to pack to, and then ya yell at me.	[]
Other	31	0	I'm sorry. Sorry. But now I've packed everything away, so just... well, play something uplifting, like... I'm gonna put all this behind me and make it okay music.	[]
Other	16	1	Ooooh, I don't want her. You can have her. She's too fat for me.	['fat']
Other	3	0	Oh!  Jesus, Marc.	[]
Other	17	1	Parents, this is the new Scout leader, Mr. Grazier. He will be taking over for the homosexual.	['homosexual']
Randy	4	0	Nice to meet you.	[]
Other	15	0	Marsh, right? We actually kind of know each other. Your wife and mine are friends.	[]
Other	3	0	Your wife, huh?	[]
Other	10	0	Carol is the head of a girls' Mountain Scouts troop.	[]
Randy	12	0	Well, I guess we're off to the bar until nine, then.	[]
Other	6	0	Gonna go pound some brews, huh?	[]
Other	44	0	And so I said to him, Hey, I- I may be handicapped, bu-but I'm not... deaf.  Wow, what a terrific audience. Well, for my next joke I'm gonna need a vo-volunteer from the audience, very much. How about you, Timmy?	[]
Other	1	0	Timmay.	[]
Other	54	1	Sure, come on up here, Tim-Tim.  Timmy, ladies and gentlemen. Let's give him a hand, very much. Come to think of it, give him a pair of legs, too.  Here, Timmy, put on this silly hat.  Just for a second, Timmy.  Don't be a jerk, Timmy.  Hey, don't push me!	['jerk']
Other	1	0	Timmih!	[]
Cartman	2	1	Cripple fight!	['cripple']
Other	7	0	That is enough, Scouts! Take your seats!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Awww!	[]
Other	49	0	Alright, Scouts, I am your new Scout Master, Mr. Grazier!  Together we are going to become the best! The sleekest! The most polished Scout troop in all of Colorado! Isn't that right!  When I ask you a question you will answer Yes, Scoutmaster! Do I make myself clear?!	[]
Other	2	0	Yes, Scoutmaster!	[]
Other	31	0	Good! Now, the first activity for this evening will be...  naked pictures  I'm going to take some pictures of each of you naked, in case we need them, for later.	[]
Other	1	0	Awww.	[]
Other	40	0	Aw, what is this?! If there's one thing I hate, it's a whining platoon! We don't wanna do pushups! We don't wanna get up early! We don't wanna have you take naked pictures of us!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Man, this guy sucks.	[]
Other	7	0	Now, fall in and strip down, Scouts!	[]
Other	57	0	Alright, Scouts, we're gonna end this meeting with a little puppet show.  Here's a little Scout. He's always prepared. He's always ready. Now, here's a little Scout telling his parents that Mr. Grazier took naked pictures of him. Look what happens.  Oh! No! Aw! Aw! Aw!  Do I make myself clear, Scouts?!	[]
Other	2	0	Yes, Scoutmaster!	[]

Other	15	0	Well, you know what I say about kids: They're all pink on the inside.	[]
Randy	2	0	You bet.	[]
Other	3	0	I heard that.	[]
Randy	4	0	See ya, Mr. Grazier.	[]
Other	5	0	Go away! I'm dead!	[]

Other	11	0	I can't, kids. I've been... kicked out of Scouts.	[]
Stan	4	0	Kicked out? Oh no!	[]
Cartman	12	0	But you have to come back. We hate our new scout leader.	[]

Butters	5	0	We can't tell you.	[]
Other	2	0	Why not?	[]
Butters	9	0	Oh, no. No. Oh, no. No! Oh no no!	[]
Stan	18	1	Please, Big Gay Al. We don't wanna go on a camp trip with this guy next week.	['gay']
Other	13	1	Boys, there's nothing I can do. The Scouts don't allow homosexuals.	['homosexuals']
Other	22	0	Well then that settles it! Fellas, what we're gonna hafta do is try to ch... change the Scouts' rules, very much.	[]
Stan	4	0	What do we want?	[]
Other	3	1	Gays in Scouts!	['gays']
Stan	5	0	When do we want it?	[]
Other	1	0	Timmih!	[]
Stan	4	0	What do we want?	[]
Other	3	1	Gays in Scouts!	['gays']
Stan	5	0	When do we want it?	[]
Other	1	0	Timmih!	[]
Stan	4	0	What do we want?	[]
Randy	2	0	Oh, no.	[]
Other	3	1	Gays in Scouts!	['gays']
Stan	5	0	When do we want it?	[]
Other	1	0	Timmih!	[]
Stan	4	0	What do we want?	[]
Other	3	1	Gays in Scouts!	['gays']
Stan	5	0	When do we want it?	[]
Other	1	0	Timmih!	[]
Stan	11	0	Alright, this looks like the perfect place to get some signatures.	[]
Other	4	0	Puppies. Puppies for sale.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Beat it, toots! We've got discrimination work to do!	[]
Stan	28	3	Alright, let's set up.  Ah hi, we're here to collect signature in support to force the Scouts to accept gays?  Uh, hello, gays in Scouts?  Goddamnit!	['gays', 'gays', 'goddamnit']
Butters	19	0	Hey! Why don't we have Jimmy do some stand-up comedy? Like at our bake sale, very much?	[]

Other	2	0	Hahnah Timmih.	[]
Other	2	0	Come on!	[]
Other	1	0	Timmih!	[]
Other	2	0	No!  Ow!	[]
Other	13	1	Timmy? Timmy? I told you to put on the HAT!!  You dirty motherfucker!	['motherfucker']
Other	4	0	What's goin' on?	[]
Other	6	1	Some kind of gay pride rally.	['gay']
Other	4	0	Lah-livin' a lie!	[]
Other	43	1	Tom, I'm standing out in front of Henry's Supermarket where five brave little boys are holding a rally to support gays in scouting. The rally is drawing so much attention that people from all over the country are taking media notice.	['gays']
Other	17	0	Those boys have shown me the light. I never knew the Mountain Scouts was a hate group.	[]
Other	16	1	This is a wake up call to America. We cannot turn our backs on gays anymore!	['gays']
Randy	8	0	Oh, God, they're actually pulling it off.	[]
Other	22	0	The rally has also caught the attention of old Scouts members, like Steven Spielberg, director of such films as Always and 1941.	[]
Other	17	0	I salute those boys and their courage. I am hereby cutting all my funding to the Scouts!	[]
Other	13	0	The rally has also caught the attention of high-powered lawyer, Gloria Allred.	[]
Other	18	1	It is a disgrace that these homophobes are allowed to discriminate.  I am taking this case on, personally!	['homophobes']
Other	19	1	With this kind of support, Tom, these boys are sure to have a victory for gays. Back to you.	['gays']
Other	37	2	Thanks, Chris. In other news, the FBI has finally caught the child molester known as Mr. Slippyfist.  This sick child molester was found with disturbing graphic photos of young boys naked, which we will show you now.	['molester', 'molester']
Other	7	0	Here's one. And here's another.	[]
Other	1	0	Kenny?	[]
Randy	3	0	Oh my God.	[]
Other	12	1	Here, look at this one. Sick sonofabitch! Here's one right here.	['sonofabitch']
Other	5	0	Alright, boys, break it up.	[]
Other	2	0	All rise.	[]
Other	40	3	In the case of Big Gay Al versus Mountain Scouts of America: due to the overwhelming show of support, it is the ruling of this court that the Scouts must allow Big Gay Al and all gays into their club!	['gay', 'gay', 'gays']
Other	3	0	Alright! Yeah! Woohoo!	[]
Randy	27	2	Well, we'va all learned an important lesson. That just because somebody's gay doesn't mean they're gonna molest children. Straight people do that too.	['gay', 'molest']
Other	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Other	23	0	And furthermore, the Scout elders will be put into stocks for three days, so they can see how it feels to be outcast!	[]
Other	3	0	Hooray, yeah, yeah!	[]
Stan	6	0	We did it! We did it!	[]
Other	7	0	I did it! I did it! Haha!	[]
Other	51	2	Today is a great day for democracy. The Scouts have been exposed for the vile gay bashers they are.  And we all it all to me, and these six brave little boys  five... brave little boys. And now, here to take his official oath back in Scouts is Big Gay Al.	['gay', 'gay']
Other	11	0	Thank you all very much. But I don't want this.	[]
Other	4	0	What's he saying?	[]
Stan	1	0	Huh?	[]
Other	188	2	Look, I appreciate what you kids did; I really do. But this isn't what I wanted. I'm proud to be gay. And I'm proud to be in a country where I'm free to express myself. But freedom is a two-way street. If I'm free to express myself, then the Scouts have to be free to express themselves, too. I know these men. They are good men. They are kind men. They do what they think is best for kids. No matter how wrong we think they might be, it isn't right for us to force them to think our way. It's up to us to persuade, and help them see the light, not extort them to. Please, don't cut the Scouts' funding. The Scouts help and have always helped a lot of kids. That's why I love them. I will continue to persuade them to change their mind, but this is the wrong way to do it. So, I am hereby dropping my case, and allowing the Scouts their right to not allow gays into their private club.	['gay', 'gays']
Other	2	0	Uh, Hooray!	[]
Other	2	0	Hooray, hey!	[]
Stan	6	0	So wait, did we do good?	[]
Butters	6	0	Uh yeah, ah I think so.	[]
Cartman	4	1	Eh, we kick ass.	['ass']
Other	10	0	Come on kids, let's go get some ice cream!	[]
Other	7	1	You can't do this! You homophobe!	['homophobe']
Other	24	0	Well, Timmy, I guess we learned an important lesson, too, very much. There is room for more than one handi-capable person in Scouts.	[]
Other	1	0	Timmih.	[]
Other	12	0	I'm glad we're best friends now. See ya at Scouts.	[]
Other	2	0	Tim-mih.	[]
Other	15	0	Timmih Timmih Timmih Timmih, Timmih Timmih Timmih.  Timmih Timmih Timmih Timmih, Timmih Timmih Timmih.  Aaaaah.	[]
Stan	10	0	Timmy, come on! We're gonna be late for Scouts!	[]
Other	18	0	Alright, boys, I am your new Scout leader. Everything is going to be just fine. No naked pictures.	[]
Other	2	0	Uh, Timmih.	[]
Other	5	0	Yes, Timmy?  Oh dear. Jimmy?	[]
Other	1	0	Yes?	[]
Other	12	0	You know our policy: I'm afraid you're... out of Scouts.	[]
Other	3	0	Out of Scouts?	[]
Other	2	0	Tim-mih.	[]
Other	13	0	What?  Hey wait a minute! This is crazy! You can't do this!	[]
Stan	7	1	Wow, I never knew Jimmy was gay.	['gay']
Butters	2	0	Me neither.	[]
Other	2	0	No! No!	[]
Other	1	0	Timmay!	[]
