Kyle	7	0	Hey you guys! Look what I have!	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Kyle	8	0	Four tickets to The Lion King on stage!	[]
Other	1	0	...Oh.	[]
Kyle	12	0	Aww, come on, you guys! It's supposed to be really cool.	[]
Stan	9	0	Yeah - no - I'd, it, it sounds really cool.	[]
Cartman	13	0	You guys!!! Hey you guys!!! Oh my God!! Oh my God, you guys!!	[]
Kyle	2	0	What, doughboy?	[]
Cartman	13	0	I was just-  I was just watching the TV! They had this commercial.	[]
Stan	1	0	So?	[]
Cartman	13	0	So, guess what they're gonna say tonight on that show, Cop Drama.	[]
Kyle	1	0	What?	[]
Cartman	16	0	No, come on! Guess! They're gonna say something that's never been said on television.	[]
Kyle	1	0	What?!	[]
Cartman	4	0	You'll never guess.	[]
Stan	1	0	What?!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Guess.	[]
Kyle	10	1	Goddamnit, Cartman! What are they gonna say on Cop Drama?	['goddamnit']
Cartman	13	1	You ready?  Tonight, on Cop Drama, on TV, they're gonna say,  Shit.	['shit']
Kyle	7	1	They're gonna say shit on television?	['shit']
Stan	7	1	They can't say shit on television!	['shit']
Cartman	11	0	It was just on the news! People are freaking out, dude.	[]
Stan	3	2	Holy fucking shit!	['fucking', 'shit']
Kenny	5	0	(Dude! We've gotta watch!)	[]
Cartman	13	0	Yeah. I'm gonna have people over to my house to see it.	[]
Kyle	12	0	Bu- but I got these tickets to see Lion King on stage.	[]
Cartman	12	1	Maybe you didn't hear me, Kyle: I said shit on television!	['shit']
Kyle	24	0	It's just a marketing ploy by the network. Like that time they had the first male-to-male kiss with Terrance and Phillip?	[]
Stan	7	0	Aw, come, on dude! This is history.	[]
Kyle	3	0	It's stupid!	[]
Cartman	18	1	Jeez, you're a little irritable, Kyle. What's the matter? You got some sand in your vagina?	['vagina']
Kyle	31	1	No, I don't have sand in my vagina! I just think it's a little immature for us to be standing around talking about one dumb word being on TV!	['vagina']
Randy	8	0	Hey, uh, Sam, did you hear the news?	[]
Other	8	1	Yeah, they're gonna say shit on television.	['shit']
Other	12	0	Hey, we should all get together and watch it at the bar.	[]
Other	1	0	Yeaaahhh!	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Randy	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Other	8	0	Are you guys gonna let your kids watch?	[]
Randy	14	0	Oh, sure, I mean, you know, Cop Drama is a very artsy, dramatic show.	[]
Other	6	1	And they're gonna say shit!	['shit']
Kyle	20	0	Hey, Butters!  I got tickets to go see Lion King tonight, and I decided to invite  YOU before anybody else.	[]
Butters	36	1	Oh, sorry, I can't.  They're gonna say shit on Cop Drama, and my mom and dad say I have to watch it with them so that I don't take it the wrong way.	['shit']
Kyle	14	0	How many ways are there to take it?! It's just a stupid word!	[]
Mr. Garrison	8	0	Hey everybody, it's on in thirty minutes!	[]
Other	16	0	Listen, Mitchell, I put my life on the line every day. How dare you accuse me!	[]
Mr. Garrison	9	0	Oh, I bet this is it! Here it comes.	[]
Other	15	0	I'm doing my job, Frank! We have to know where that evidence was shipped!	[]
Other	7	0	Oh, was that it? Was that it?!	[]
Randy	4	0	Shipped. He said shipped.	[]
Other	13	0	I told you, we don't have a record of that. And besides, -	[]
Cartman	8	2	Goddamn it! When are they gonna say shit?!	['goddamn', 'shit']
Stan	1	0	Sh!	[]
Other	6	0	Maybe... maybe protect them from you?	[]
Other	9	0	Maybe you're forgetting who you're talking to!	[]
Other	12	0	And maybe you're forgetting I used to be a cop, too!	[]
Other	9	0	Yeah? You used to be a lot of things.	[]
Other	13	0	Oh, he doesn't know that Mitchell slept with his wife, does he?	[]
Other	9	0	That's it, I've had enough of this.	[]
Other	9	0	Don't you turn your back on me, you!	[]
Other	3	0	I said, enough!	[]
Other	2	0	Is it?	[]
Other	5	0	Will it... ever be enough?	[]
Other	7	0	Cop Drama will return after these messages.	[]
Stan	10	1	Jesus Christ! Another commercial? Are they ever gonna say shit?	['shit']
Cartman	13	0	I'm sure they're just holding it 'til the very last scene.	[]
Other	1	0	Uh!	[]
Stan	5	0	Where are you going, Kyle?	[]
Kyle	9	0	I'm going to the kitchen! This is stupid!	[]
Stan	17	1	But you're gonna miss it! They're gonna say shit and you're gonna miss it!	['shit']
Kyle	7	1	I don't really give a fuck!	['fuck']
Stan	1	0	Oh.	[]
Other	15	0	Just understand that it's my job. I still think you're a good cop.	[]
Other	24	0	Well, Mitchell. I guess you're goin'ta do what you're gonna do. Let's just try and stay friends no matter what.	[]
Other	9	0	You're right. Maybe I'll see you around.	[]
Other	17	1	Goodbye. Oh, and Mitchell?  You've got some shit on the side of your mouth right there.	['shit']
Other	4	0	Oh, yeah, thanks, thanks.	[]
Other	1	0	Wow!!!	[]
Other	1	0	Whoa!!!	[]
Other	1	0	Oh!!	[]
Other	1	0	Whoa!	[]
Other	3	0	They did it!	[]
Stan	8	0	I can't believe they actually said it.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Dude! You missed it, Kyle! It was so awesome!	[]
Kyle	17	0	Well! I hope it lived up to all the hype! You must feel so much better now!	[]
Cartman	19	1	Kyle, we've gotta get that sand out of your vagina. It's making you cranky. Does it itch?	['vagina']
Kyle	39	1	Do you really think anything's gonna be any different now?!  Do you really think that this will have the tiniest, smallest effect on the world?  It's still the same old world out there. Look.  What the hell?	['hell']
Cartman	6	0	Whoa, dude, it's raining frogs.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Oh, whatever.	[]
Other	83	4	Last night, the daring and bold show, Cop Drama , broke new ground by saying Shit! on television, making shit officially okay to say around the country.  A recent poll shows that 24% of Americans think the show has pushed the envelope too far, while a whopping 76% say they don't really give a shit.  In other news, a strange virus which causes victims to vomit up their intestines is making life shitty for a small farming community.  Rick Watts has the story.	['shit', 'shit', 'shit', 'shitty']
Other	12	1	Thanks, Tom. Shit is certainly going down here in the small town-	['shit']
Other	2	1	Whoa, shit!	['shit']
Other	22	1	Alright, children, in lieu of the common usage, I'm s'posed to clarify the school's position on the word, shit.	['shit']
Stan	8	1	Wow! We can say shit in school now?!	['shit']
Kyle	13	0	This is ridiculous! Just because they say it on TV it's alright.	[]
Other	12	0	Yes, but only in the figurative noun form or the adjective form	[]
Cartman	1	0	Huh?	[]
Other	37	2	You can only use it in the non-literal sense. For instance,  That's a shitty picture of me. is now fine. Hoever, the literal noun form of  This is a picture of shit. is still naughty.	['shitty', 'shit']
Cartman	5	0	I don't get it.	[]
Stan	2	0	Me neither.	[]
Other	52	3	The adjective form is now also acceptable. For example:  The weather outside is shitty. However, the literal adjective is not appropriate. For example:  My bad diarrhea made the inside of the toilet bowl shitty, and I had to clean it with a rag, which then also became shitty.  That's right out!	['shitty', 'shitty', 'shitty']
Other	3	1	Sss...sss... shit.	['shit']
Other	3	0	Very good, Timmy.	[]
Butters	19	2	Uh, Ms. Choksondik, eh, can we say it in the expletive? Like, Oh, shit, or, shit on a shingle?	['shit', 'shit']
Other	5	0	Yes, that's now fine.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Wow, this is gonna be great! A whole new word!	[]
Kyle	16	1	It's not new!! I'm gonna look shit up in the encyclopedia and prove it!!	['shit']
Cartman	15	1	Don't mind Kyle, everyone, he's just got a little sand in his vagina.	['vagina']
Kyle	7	1	There's no sand in my vagina!!!	['vagina']
Other	5	1	Boys, watch your language! Shit!	['shit']
Mr. Garrison	20	1	And so, children, instead of saying Hand in your papers, I may now say, Hand in your shit. Any questions?	['shit']
Other	8	1	What about, I have to take a shit?	['shit']
Mr. Garrison	29	5	No! No, Filmore! You can say I have to poop and shit, or Oh, shit, I have to poop, but not I have to shit. Are we all clear?	['poop', 'shit', 'shit', 'poop', 'shit']
Other	1	0	No.	[]
Mr. Garrison	100	22	Look, it's all about context. Well, for example, recently, I have come out and admitted that I was a homosexual. I'm gay. That means that now I can say the word, fag. On television they usually don't allow fag. But because I'm gay, it's alright. And with the new approval of the word, shit, that means that finally I am free to say,Hey, there, shitty shitty fag fag,Shitty shitty fag fag, how do you do?Hey, there, shitty shitty fag fag,Shitty shitty fag fag, how do you do? Oh this is great!	['homosexual', 'gay', 'fag', 'fag', 'gay', 'shit', 'shitty', 'shitty', 'fag', 'fag', 'shitty', 'shitty', 'fag', 'fag', 'shitty', 'shitty', 'fag', 'fag', 'shitty', 'shitty', 'fag', 'fag']
Other	7	1	Why that store has such lovely shit.	['shit']
Other	12	1	Yeah.  Too bad I don't have shit for cash right now.	['shit']
Other	8	1	Oh, looks like the weather might turn shitty.	['shitty']
Mr. Mackey	17	3	Oh, I don't really give a shit. I've done enough shit outside today and shit.	['shit', 'shit', 'shit']
Other	6	2	Shit, Peter, you look like shit.	['shit', 'shit']
Other	9	2	No, shit, I feel like shit. I think I-	['shit', 'shit']
Other	2	1	Holy shit!	['shit']
Other	5	1	Did you see that shit?	['shit']
Other	6	1	What kind of shit is this?	['shit']
Other	5	1	That is some weird shit.	['shit']
Other	5	1	Susan, your shit's ready!	['shit']
Other	7	1	Do you know where this shit goes?	['shit']
Other	4	1	Shit if I know.	['shit']
Other	5	1	Nice going, shit-for-brains.	['shit']
Other	10	1	''Old McDonald took a shit, E I E I O	['shit']
Other	2	1	No shit!	['shit']
Mr. Garrison	16	8	''Hey, there, shitty shitty fag fag,Shitty shitty fag fag, how do you do?Hey, there,-	['shitty', 'shitty', 'fag', 'fag', 'shitty', 'shitty', 'fag', 'fag']
Other	4	1	Oh, shit, 'scuse me.	['shit']
Mr. Garrison	4	1	Hey, watch it, fag.	['fag']
Other	5	0	What did you call me?	[]
Mr. Garrison	42	12	I called you a fag. Because I'm gay, and that means I'm free to use the word fag. So piss off, you fag-shitter! Heh, so hey there, shity shitty fag fagShitty shitty fag fag, ba doop a doop doo	['fag', 'gay', 'fag', 'fag', 'shitter', 'shity', 'shitty', 'fag', 'fagshitty', 'shitty', 'fag', 'fag']
Stan	15	1	This sucks. Now that shit's out, it isn't fun to say it anymore.	['shit']
Cartman	26	4	Yeah, they've taken all the fun out of shit. We're gonna have to start saying other bad words, like cock and fuck and... meecrob.	['shit', 'cock', 'fuck', 'meecrob']
Stan	3	1	What's meecrob?	['meecrob']
Cartman	39	4	You know, that stuff you get as an appetizer at Thai food restaurants. Meecrob, dude, is way grosser than shit, dude. I'd scarf down a whole wet bucket full of shit before I ate another plate of meecrob.	['meecrob', 'shit', 'shit', 'meecrob']
Kyle	22	1	You guys! You guys! I've looked up the word, shit! I think it might have something to do with people dying!	['shit']
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Kyle	16	1	Haven't you noticed everyone getting sick? It all started when they said shit on television.	['shit']
Cartman	8	1	Oh, Kyle, you are so full of meecrob.	['meecrob']
Kyle	28	1	I am not full of meecro- what? Look, the word shit first showed up in English in the 1340s, the same time as something called, The Black Death.	['shit']
Stan	3	0	What's that?	[]
Cartman	26	2	Kyle, do you still have sand in your vagina about us not going to The Lion King with you?! I mean, shit, dude, let it go.	['vagina', 'shit']
Kyle	16	0	Look! It might be a coincidence, but I think we'd better ask someone. Come on!	[]
Other	11	0	...Seventy-five share. My God, I never thought it was possible.	[]
Other	17	1	Sir, your shit idea has turned the entire network around. We're proud to work for you.	['shit']
Other	41	0	Sir, I'd just like to take this opportunity: And, I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say, you are the most creative genius in Hollywood, and... well... I'd let you have me if you wanted.	[]
Other	26	0	Thanks, Roger, but I've only just started. You see, I've already figured out our new marketing scheme technique for the next run of shows.	[]
Other	1	0	Whoa!	[]
Other	3	0	He's unstoppable!	[]
Other	5	0	What's the new idea?	[]
Other	4	0	I can hardly wait.	[]
Other	6	0	I'm about to piss myself!	[]
Other	11	1	This Saturday... on HBC... we're going to say...  shit ...twice.	['shit']
Other	1	0	Twice!	[]
Other	1	0	Brilliant!	[]
Other	4	0	Think of the repetition!	[]
Other	8	0	It's like saying it once... but double!	[]
Other	7	0	Well gentlemen, let's get on it!	[]
Other	1	1	Ho!	['ho']
Chef	27	4	Baby you are so fine, and shit!The shit you do, the shit you say; I'd jump on your shit any day! Oh, hello there, children.	['shit', 'shit', 'shit', 'shit']
Other	2	0	Hey Chef.	[]
Kyle	8	1	Chef, do you know where shit comes from?	['shit']
Chef	5	1	Uh, from your ass, children.	['ass']
Kyle	5	1	No no! The word, shit.	['shit']
Chef	1	0	Oh.	[]
Cartman	16	2	Detective Sandy Vagina here  thinks that shit might have something to do with everyone getting sick.	['vagina', 'shit']
Kyle	21	1	Ungh, it said in my book that the word, shit, started exactly the same time as something called, The Black Death.	['shit']
Chef	6	0	The Black Death? Are you sure?	[]
Stan	6	0	What's the Black Death, Chef?	[]
Chef	3	0	LaToya Jackson, children.	[]
Other	1	0	Oh.	[]
Chef	13	0	But I think back in those days it meant something else: the plague!	[]
Chef	21	1	It says here the word, shit has been around for over 600 years. It comes from the Anglo-Saxon word, skite.	['shit']
Kyle	24	1	Right. But in the 1340s people in England stopped calling it skite and started calling it shit. The same year as the Black Plague.	['shit']
Other	42	1	This is the oldest book in the library.  A priceless original of England's history. Just about everything you could want to know about the plague is in this great tome.  Oh, shit. Well, this other book has some good information, too.	['shit']
Chef	11	0	The Black Plague. Over half of Europe was killed by it.	[]
Stan	12	0	Look, they're puking out their intestines, just like the people here.	[]
Chef	33	0	Look at this, children.  It says that the people in England believed that the plague was a curse, a dark magic infliction brought on by a mass utterance of a word of curse.	[]
Stan	3	0	Word of curse?	[]
Kyle	3	0	A... curse word.	[]
Chef	16	0	Of course! I've never even thought about why we use the term curse word before.	[]
Stan	9	0	Because it brings a curse? Like the Black Death.	[]
Cartman	31	1	You guys, look here.  In this Nancy Drew mystery, Nancy goes to the beach and gets sand trapped in her shoe. This could explain how Kyle got it in his vagina.	['vagina']
Kyle	4	0	Cartman, this is serious!!!	[]
Cartman	21	1	So am I, Kyle. If that sand in your vagina doesn't get released, you could become a walking time bomb.	['vagina']
Other	24	1	If you don't mind, I'll have to close up now. They're going to say shit seven times on HBC and I-	['shit']
Stan	2	1	Holy shit!	['shit']
Cartman	3	1	Oh-Ho, gross!	['ho']
Kyle	7	0	Dude, this plague is spreading like wildfire!	[]
Stan	2	0	Uh oh.	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Uh oh.)	[]
Cartman	6	0	Kenny's got it. heh heh.	[]
Kyle	24	1	We've gotta do something, Chef. If we don't we don't stop that network,  shit will become an even more acceptable word!	['shit']
Chef	18	1	Children, we've got to warn those producers in Hollywood that the plague, and shit, could be linked!	['shit']
Other	63	3	Hello, ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. If you look out the right side of the aircraft you can see some interesting shit.  And over on the left side, there's some interesting shit, too.  Well, we should be arriving in Los Angeles in about two hours. Until then we invite you to sit back, relax, and enjoy our shitty service.	['shit', 'shit', 'shitty']
Cartman	11	1	Goddamn it, Kenny! Don't get your plague germs on me!	['goddamn']
Kyle	5	1	Cartman, stop being an asshole!	['asshole']
Other	19	1	Tha ratings are in, sir. We broke another record last night with the show that said shit seven times!	['shit']
Other	17	0	Where is the roof on this thing? I mean, I mean, how can we top ourselves now?	[]
Other	42	2	Gentlemen, I have it. The end-all greatest marketing ploy of all time.  Tonight, on HBC, we will air all our sitcoms... LIVE. And have everyone say shit in place of their written lines. And we'll call it Must Shit TV.	['shit', 'shit']
Other	1	0	Bravo!	[]
Other	5	1	Night Of A Million Shits!	['shits']
Other	10	0	Now, doing this live will be difficult, so we must-	[]
Chef	6	0	Hold on a minute, Mr. Producer!	[]
Other	3	0	Who are you?	[]
Chef	17	1	My name is Chef, and these are the children! We've come to warn you about shit.	['shit']
Other	6	0	Oh brother, another Christian protest group.	[]
Other	6	0	Who wants to take this one?	[]
Other	108	0	I'll get it.  Gentlemen, we appreciate your concern.  Here at HBC the general goal is providing the highest and most thought-provoking netertainment. How great it is that we live in a country where an artist can express himself freely. That's not only the American spirit, it's the HBC spirit. Which allows us to make great family programs like Halo The Turtle, and of course, everyone's favorite show, Cop Drama. We can't thank you enough for bringing your concerns to our network, for it is you, the loyal HBC viewer, who makes this great network, and indeed, the great country that it is.	[]
Other	6	0	Alright, now, as I was saying-	[]
Chef	5	0	Hey! Hold on a minute!	[]
Other	5	0	Aw, are they stil here?	[]
Chef	11	0	Haven't you people noticed all the strange things going on?	[]
Kyle	15	1	We think that you might have could it by helping make shit an everyday word.	['shit']
Other	3	0	Hm, right, right.	[]
Kyle	13	0	It's true. We think that word might be plaguing our friend, Kenny.	[]
Other	7	0	Do you have any proof of this?	[]
Kyle	1	0	...No.	[]
Other	11	0	Then  get out of here before we have you thrown out!	[]
Cartman	10	0	But... we can keep the Halo the Turtle dolls, right?	[]
Chef	4	2	Damn cracker-ass producers!	['damn', 'ass']
Stan	7	0	Now what are we gonna do, Chef?	[]
Chef	20	0	I don't know, children. I guess we've got to get the word out to people some other way.	[]
Other	1	0	Aaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh.	[]
Stan	2	1	Oh shit!	['shit']
Other	2	0	Stand aside!	[]
Other	18	1	Alright, now, we have to get all our biggest names to say shit, and then we're gonna-	['shit']
Other	4	0	Halt your evil plans!	[]
Other	1	0	Huh?	[]
Other	12	0	I possess the Rune Stone of Undoing! Who is in charge here?	[]
Other	20	0	Oh...  No, you guys didn't hire me a stripper for my birthday- oh, tell me you guys didn't.	[]
Other	30	0	Show your true form, Geldon, lest you be afraid! Your short time in this world is at an end!  Ach. The Rune Stone has no effect! You are not Geldon!	[]
Other	5	0	I never said I was.	[]
Other	12	0	You will die anyway, for you have spread the word of curse!	[]
Other	1	0	Security!	[]
Other	2	0	Ach!  oh.	[]
Chef	3	0	Who are you?	[]
Other	2	0	Take this.	[]
Stan	8	0	What are we supposed to do with it?	[]
Other	1	0	Eeehhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Now what?	[]
Chef	32	1	We've got to find people who would know what the hell this is all about. Children, we're goin' to have to go to the land of castles, knights, and kings!	['hell']
Other	15	0	Lords and Ladies, we bid you welcome to the grandest casino in the land, Excalibur!	[]
Other	7	0	Take a free spin. Double your odds.	[]
Chef	6	0	'Scuse me. Do you work here?	[]
Other	7	0	How can I help you, noble sir?	[]
Kyle	9	0	We need some help identifying an ancient English stone.	[]
Other	2	0	A what?	[]
Stan	8	0	It might hold the key to a curse.	[]
Other	13	0	Uh... I can help get you some credit or a comp meal, perhaps.	[]
Stan	7	0	Dude, we need help from the British!	[]
Other	25	0	Look kid, This is just a casino. I can't help you. You know, not every British person knows about wizards  and dragons and curses.	[]
Chef	6	0	We just need help identifying this.	[]
Other	10	0	The Rune Stome of Gaelic! Where did you get this?	[]
Stan	5	0	You know what it is?	[]
Other	14	0	The Skire once spoke of such a stone! Come, we must see the sorcerer!	[]
Other	18	2	Get ready for Must Shit TV! Starting now, four straight hours of pure shit! It's all live!	['shit', 'shit']

Other	6	0	This is it. My greatest work.	[]
Other	2	2	Cocktails. Cocktails.	['cocktails', 'cocktails']
Other	7	0	These Americans wish to see the Skire!	[]
Other	8	0	Let us make haste to the inner sanctum!	[]
Other	17	0	How could you foolish Americans bring the wrath of scorn by mass-chanting the word of wretchedness?!	[]
Chef	7	0	Uh, yeah. We didn't mean to.	[]
Other	9	1	Didn't you realize shit is a curse word?!	['shit']
Stan	15	0	Well, yeah, but I don't think that we knew curse word meant... curse word.	[]
Other	26	0	Ha! Leave it to Americans to think that no means yes, pissed means angry, and curse word means something other than a word that's cursed!!	[]
Other	5	0	Let me see the stone.	[]
Chef	13	0	But I don't get it. People use curse words all the time.	[]
Other	25	0	Saying a word of curse once in a while does nothing. It's only when spoken repeatedly and en masse that the curse takes place.	[]
Other	16	0	I've seen this before. Stones that were used by the Knights of Standards and Practices.	[]
Chef	5	0	Knights of Standards and Practices?	[]
Other	21	0	A legion of men sworn to do whatever necessary to keep the words at bay. But... they were just a myth.	[]
Other	8	1	You know what? You're dumb as shit!	['shit']
Other	10	1	Oh yeah?! Well, I don't really give a shit!	['shit']
Randy	15	0	Ya know, that word's kind of getting old. It's not really... funny anymore.	[]
Other	14	0	Yeah, they're gonna have to come up with a new swear word soon.	[]
Mr. Garrison	17	3	Well, they can't use fag. Because you can't say fag unless you're a homosexual.	['fag', 'fag', 'homosexual']
Randy	6	0	Really? So we can't say ***?	[]
Mr. Garrison	5	0	No. See, you got beeped.	[]
Other	9	0	You mean you have to be a *** to say ***?	[]
Mr. Garrison	3	0	That's right.	[]
Other	12	1	Well, that's not fair! I should be able to say fag.	['fag']
Randy	6	0	...Hey, you didn't get beeped.	[]
Other	2	0	Uh oh.	[]
Mr. Garrison	20	1	Well, well, well! Guess we learned something new about you, Jimbo, you freakin' fag! You wanna make out or something?	['fag']

Kyle	44	0	The knights of Standards and Practices were created to make sure that bad words were kept to a minimum. Curse words They're called that because they are a curse. We have to go back to only using curse words in rare, extreme circumstances.	[]
Stan	35	0	And besides, too much use of a dirty word takes away from its... impact. We believe in free speech and all that, but... keeping a few words taboo just adds to the fun of English.	[]
