Ike	4	0	I gotta go tinkle.	[]
Kyle	3	0	No Ike! Shh!	[]
Other	10	0	Sov, sov, sov! Sov, sov, sov! Ma nayim vi-tov.	[]
Other	27	0	We thank God for our blessings this Chanukah. Our little family is so loving, and perfect, and nothing will ever tear us apart.  I'll get it.	[]
Other	2	0	Gerald Broflovski?	[]
Other	1	0	Yes?	[]
Other	15	0	My name is Harry Gints and this is my wife Elise. We're from Canada.	[]
Other	4	0	Yes, I can tell.	[]
Other	35	0	My wife and I had a child a few years back, and, we weren't ready to have a child, so we put him up for adoption.  We were told that you might be the-	[]
Other	12	0	Peter!  Oh God, Harry! It's our son!  Peter, it's Mommy.	[]
Other	7	1	Gerald, what the hell is going on?	['hell']
Other	5	0	I I'm not sure.	[]
Other	36	0	It was a tough time for us. It was a tough time for all of Canada. The whole country was devastated by the cola wars. It just seemed we couldn't take care of a baby.	[]
Other	29	0	So we put him up for adoption. But as the years passed, I, I just felt an emptiness in my heart.  Oh it's so good to see him.	[]
Other	30	0	Well we wish you all the best, Mr. and Mrs. Gints, but to be honest, I think it would be best for Ike if you didn't come around again.	[]
Other	19	0	I don't think you understand. We didn't come to visit Peter, we came to take him back.	[]
Other	1	0	What?	[]
Other	8	0	We want to take Peter home, to Canada.	[]
Other	3	0	Are you crazy?!	[]
Other	12	0	Look, you gave Ike up. You can't just change your mind.	[]
Other	31	0	Changing your mind is a Canadian custom that we hold quite dear. And besides, the new Canadian Prime Minister has issued a decree that all adopted Canadians must be returned home.	[]
Other	5	0	The new Canadian Prime Minister?	[]
Other	6	0	Look, Ike is our son now!	[]
Other	13	0	He doesn't belong here. He belongs in Canada with his own kind.	[]
Other	6	0	I think you'd better leave.	[]
Other	9	0	Please, don't make things any harder for Peter.	[]
Other	27	0	Harder for Peter?! Now you two just blow in here and say you're gonna haul him back to Canada, and we're being hard on Peter?!	[]
Other	16	0	We're prepared to go to court! We had hoped it wouldn't come to that!	[]
Other	10	1	Well you bet your ass it'll come to that!	['ass']
Other	36	0	I'm sorry to say that my hands are tied. The new Prime Minister of Canada has authority this court cannot override. By Canadian law I must award custody of the child to his birth parents.	[]
Other	1	0	Yes!	[]
Other	1	0	Yes!	[]
Other	1	0	No!	[]
Kyle	7	0	Ike's not my little brother anymore?	[]
Other	3	0	Gerald, do something!	[]
Other	6	0	There's nothing I can do.	[]
Other	17	0	Good-bye, Ike. You...  be a good bye, huh? You... remember all the things we taught you.	[]
Kyle	9	0	Ike, you'll always be my little brother, okay?	[]
Other	7	0	Come on, Peter, we should get going.	[]
Ike	1	0	No!	[]
Other	8	0	Peter, you must come with Mommy and Daddy.	[]
Ike	5	0	No no no no no!	[]
Other	4	0	I have some chocolate.	[]
Ike	1	0	Chocolate!	[]
Other	9	0	We're going to take good care of him.	[]
Kyle	22	0	You'd better!  Dad, can't we talk to this new Canadian Prime Minister? Iif he knew the situation, he might e-	[]
Other	18	0	Oh! Kyle, appealing to the Prime Minister of Canada would take... time and money we don't have.	[]
Cartman	19	0	Dude, look at that. Sprinkle Time Make Your Own Marshmallow Factory. I'm definitely asking for that for Christmas.	[]
Stan	19	0	Dude, I'm gonna tell my parents to get me that John Elway doll with the karate-chop action.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Guys.  Guys, I need your help.	[]
Stan	2	0	Sure dude.	[]
Kyle	40	0	It's been a week since Ike's been gone, and every day my parents seem worse. I have to try to go to Canada and speak with the new Canadian Prime Minister, but I can't do it alone.	[]
Cartman	10	0	We can't go to Canada, dumbass! It's Christmas!	[]
Stan	12	0	Yeah, dude. What if we miss out on some great Christmas adventure?	[]
Kyle	28	0	Please, you guys, you don't understand.  My family is devastated. My mom just walks around the house like a zombie, and my dad can't stop crying.	[]
Cartman	22	1	Well, I didn't wanna say anything, Kyle, but I think this is what your family gets for being Jewish at Christmastime.	['jewish']
Stan	2	0	Dude, Cartman.	[]
Cartman	14	0	I'm just saying, maybe Jesus is having a little revenge, that's all.	[]
Kyle	19	0	I found the number for a really cheap airline to Canada. If we go as soon as possible, then-	[]
Stan	29	0	Dude, we just can't up and go to Canada. Look, they're about to light the Christmas tree. Maybe you can get your brother back some other way.	[]
Cartman	22	0	Kyle, I just want you to know, if it were any other time of the year, I still wouldn't help you.	[]
Other	4	0	Three! Two! One!  Yaaaaay!	[]
Other	53	0	As we celebrate this glorious time, we can't forget those families who are suffering. As many of you know, the Broflovski family has recently had their child torn away from them. As a community, we must do all we can to ease their pain. Are there any suggestions how we might help?	[]
Mr. Garrison	9	0	How about, we get rid of all the Mexicans?	[]
Other	20	0	Mr. Garrison, every Christmas you suggest we get rid of all the Mexicans, and every Christmas we tell you NO!	[]
Mr. Garrison	1	0	Rats!	[]
Chef	32	0	The Broflovskis need money to appeal that case to the new Canadian Prime Minister. What if this Christmas, instead of buyin' presents, we all use that money to give to the Broflovskis?	[]
Cartman	14	0	HA! Yeah, right! Like our parents aren't gonna buy us presents for Christmas!	[]
Other	6	0	That's a great idea, Chef.	[]
Cartman	1	0	What?	[]
Randy	15	0	Yeah. Who needs more stuff, anyway? This Christmas we can do somethin' that really matters!	[]
Stan	6	0	Dad, don't get carried away.	[]
Other	28	0	Then it's settled: This year we'll give all our Christmas money to the Broflovskis, in hopes that they may someday have their child returned to them.	[]
Cartman	7	0	No! No, this can't be happening!	[]
Cartman	8	2	You fucking asshole!! This is all your fault!!	['fucking', 'asshole']
Kyle	1	0	What?	[]
Cartman	23	2	Everyone's gonna be charitable and give money to your family instead of buying Christmas presents!!  You fucking Jews ruined Christmas again!!  AAAAAA!!	['fucking', 'jews']
Stan	3	0	Whoa whoa, Cartman.	[]
Cartman	18	0	It wasn't enough for you people to kill Jesus, now you have to kill Christmas too, huh?!	[]
Stan	3	0	Cartman, calm down!	[]
Kyle	3	0	Is that true?	[]
Stan	7	0	It's true, dude. Christmas is ruined.	[]
Cartman	13	0	This is it, Kyle. You and me. We're throwin' down. Right now.	[]
Kyle	44	0	I'm sorry you guys, but there is something we can do. We can go to Canada and see the Prime Minister like I said. If we can change his mind before Christmas, then your parents won't have to give my family money.	[]
Cartman	14	0	You really think if we go to Canada we might still get Christmas presents?	[]
Kyle	13	0	It's worth a shot. Come on, you guys, we can do this.	[]
Stan	14	0	Oh all right, but we'd better not miss out on great Christmas adventures.	[]
Kyle	10	0	We'll get back in time for a Christmas adventure.	[]
Cartman	20	0	Fine. But if it doesn't work, you and me are gonna have it out, Kyle. Once and for all.	[]

Cartman	15	0	You guys go get Ike. Kenny and I will stay here and watch the fort.	[]
Stan	12	0	No, you're both coming. Do you care about Christmas or not?	[]
Cartman	11	0	Of course I care about Christmas- Doh, Christ on a stick!	[]
Cartman	10	0	Aw dude, it smells like Kung Pao chicken in here!	[]
Other	47	2	Okay, welcome aboard Shitty Airrines. This is your captain speaking. Rooking about a two hour fright. I'll be turning on the seatbelt sign now. If your seats have seatbelts, this is the time you will fasten them. Please sit back, relax, and enjoy your Shitty fright.	['shitty', 'shitty']
Kyle	7	0	All right! We're going to Canada!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Sweet.	[]
Other	7	0	Hey, turn off the right. ...Wha- oh!	[]
Stan	4	0	What's going on??	[]
Other	62	1	Herro from the cockpit, this is your captain speaking. As you can see, it appears that we are goin' down. Now would be a good time to refrect on your rife, and pray to whatever deity you bereive in. Thank you for flying Shitty Airlines. We know you have a choice in airlines, and it looks like you made the wrong one.	['shitty']

Other	11	0	What brings you folks to Canada? Why are you here today?	[]
Kyle	25	0	Uh. My adopted brother got taken back here to Canada? So, we want to talk to the new Canadian Prime Minister about getting him back?	[]
Other	28	0	His brother is our quest. The question is, is what? You must talk to the new Prime Minister if you think his brother's home's back there.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Oh Jesus Christ.	[]
Other	7	1	Hey! What the hell is going on?!	['hell']
Other	4	0	It's Scott! AAAAHHHH!	[]
Other	6	0	Who damaged our beloved Canadian land?!	[]

Kyle	7	0	So how do we get to Ottawa?	[]
Other	11	0	Oh that's easy. You just have to follow the road.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Which road?!	[]
Other	8	0	This is Canada. We only have one road.	[]
Other	4	0	Follow the only road.	[]
Other	4	0	Follow the only road.	[]
Other	36	0	To go anywhere in Canada, you just follow the only road. There's only one road in Canada. We call it the Road, the only road. Hip-hip, hooray, let's hear it for our Road.	[]

Cartman	17	0	But if you don't mind, we're in a rush to see the new Prime Minister.	[]
Other	35	0	You're going to see the new Prime Minister. Oh, I would so like to meet him myself. It's his strange new laws that took our horses away. Perhaps I will go with you.	[]

Other	17	0	Follow me this way! We're going to see the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister of Canada!	[]

Kyle	6	0	Can we just get going, please?	[]

Stan	2	0	Oh no!	[]
Cartman	6	0	How could you be so stupid!	[]

Other	18	0	It's okay, boys. The power is inside us to get to Ottawa! We can wish ourselves there!	[]
Other	7	0	Ah yes, let's wish ourselves there.	[]

Kyle	19	0	Please, sir. I traveled a long way to get here. He's the only person who can help me.	[]
Other	22	0	The Prime Minister isn't here. He's in China on official business. So you might as well go home. Good-bye!	[]
Kyle	15	0	Then that's it. I'm... I'm never going to get my brother back.	[]
Cartman	10	0	And... I'm not going to get any Christmas presents.	[]

Kenny	11	0	(And I'm not gonna have last 5 days without death...)	[]
Other	5	0	Oh please! Please stop crying.	[]
Cartman	6	0	I'm gonna kill you, Kyle.	[]
Other	12	0	All right all right, I was lying. The Prime Minister IS here.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Really?	[]
Other	4	0	Yes yes. Come in.	[]
Other	12	0	I am the Prime Minister of Canada. What do you guys want?	[]
Kyle	25	0	Sir, you recently passed a new law allowing parents who have given their children up for adoption to change their minds. My little brother was-	[]
Other	3	0	Not so fast!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Ike!	[]
Ike	1	0	Kyle!	[]
Other	28	1	Prime Minister, these are the child's Canadian parents! Their Canadian blood pumps through his veins! Would you send him back to America with those world-hungry scum?!	['scum']
Kyle	67	0	Please, sir. I came because I don't think Ike belongs here. Family isn't about whose blood you have in you, family is about the people who cared about you and took care of you. We're not the same blood, but I love my little brother. We've taken care of him because he needed us to, and that makes us more family than anything.	[]
Other	21	0	That is a great speech, guy. But the answer is no! All of my new laws will stay in effect forever!	[]
Other	4	0	Haha, you lose, Americans!	[]
Other	10	0	Then, I suppose us mounties will never get our horses.	[]
Other	7	0	And we won't get our wine.	[]
Other	7	0	And we can't perform sodomy, eh?	[]
Kyle	8	0	But why are you making such strange laws??	[]
Other	3	0	I SAID GO!	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Gah!)	[]
Stan	7	0	Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!	[]
Kyle	41	3	You... bastards!  Wha, what the hell is wrong with you?? What kind of Prime Minister bases his decisions on hatred?  And, and takes away mounties' horses?  And French people's wine? What the hell kind of Prime Minister are you, anyway?!	['bastards', 'hell', 'hell']
Other	30	0	I am the Prime Minister of Canada.  I can do whatever I-  Uh oh. Uh, don't mind that guy hiding in the spider hole, he's just my friend.	[]
Kyle	3	1	What the hell??	['hell']
Other	6	0	Hey, that looks like Saddam Hussein!	[]
Other	9	0	Saddam Hussein?? Naw, relax, baby. I'm not him.	[]
Other	23	0	Zat explains everything! Za new Prime Minister was Saddam Hussein, once again trying to take over our beloved Canada like he did before.	[]
Other	2	0	Saddam Hussein?	[]
Other	4	0	He was fooling us?	[]
Other	2	0	Get him!	[]
Other	11	0	Ahh, don't shoot. I want to negotiate. Hey, relax!  Gah!	[]
Other	22	0	Wait a minute. This means all the Prime Minister's new laws are null and void. We can have our horses back!	[]
Other	6	0	And we can drink our wine.	[]
Other	7	0	And I can sodomize me boys again	[]
Other	14	0	Young man, you... must really care for Peter to have come all this way.	[]
Other	20	0	Perhaps we were wrong to try and take Peter back. He doesn't belong here. He belongs with his family.	[]
Other	12	0	Peter, would you like to go back to your home in Colorado?	[]
Stan	3	0	What is that?	[]
Cartman	16	0	It's Christmas. We officially missed it. It's Christmas Day and ... I'm in Canada.	[]
Kyle	9	0	Wull yeah, but ah-I got my brother back.	[]
Cartman	44	1	Yeah! You got your brother back, but I didn't get any presents!  And what did I tell you, Kyle?!  I told you that if we didn't make it back in time for Christmas I was gonna whup your ass, didn't I?!	['ass']
Kyle	3	0	Dude, come on.	[]
Cartman	30	1	Well now you're gonna get it, motherfucker! That's right! You and me! Right now!  We're havin' it out! Let's go! Come on! Come on!!  Mooooooom! Moooooooom!	['motherfucker']
Other	12	0	Hey, come on, boys! You can spend Christmas with us, Canada style!	[]
Other	57	0	Ding dong, they caught Saddam! Merry Christmas to the world! Ding dong, the Americans caught Saddam! Now Canada is free for you and you and me It's the best Christmas presents we ever got Canadian Christmas, it's the best! We drink and dance and show our breasts! Let's celebrate! Saddam Hussein's been caught!	[]
Stan	13	0	Oh well. Maybe we'll get to have a Christmas adventure next year.	[]
