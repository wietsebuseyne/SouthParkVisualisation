Mr. Garrison	33	0	Okay children, let's all take our seats.  As you all know, Thanksgiving is only two weeks away. And so the school has arranged for a lecture from a real live Native American.	[]
Butters	4	0	Oh neato, huh fellas?	[]
Other	18	0	Hello boys and girls. My name is David Running Horse... Sawitsky, and I am one sixteenth Cherokee Indian.	[]
Cartman	13	0	Does that mean we only have to pay one sixteenth attention to you?	[]
Other	48	0	There've been a lot of stories about the first Thanksgiving, and unfortunately they are mostly geared towards making the Pilgrims look good, and my people being degraded as usual. Was Thanksgiving about turkey and peace? Or was it the beginning of the genocide of an entire race?	[]
Butters	4	0	Thanksgiving is about murder?	[]
Cartman	17	1	This is bullcrap! A guest speaker comes to our class and assigns us a report on Thanksgiving?	['bullcrap']
Kyle	20	0	Well, it is kinda true, you know? Thanksgiving is fun and all, but the Native Americans got pretty screwed over.	[]
Cartman	13	0	Yeah, and now my video game time is getting screwed over by them.	[]
Kyle	15	0	Hey, fatass! Instead of laying in bed eating, why don't you come and help?!	[]
Cartman	8	0	Jesus Kyle, you are really being crampy today.	[]
Stan	9	0	We all have to do this report together, dude.	[]
Cartman	23	0	You guys, we are wasting time. If we have to write a report on Thanksgiving let's just go downstairs and watch TV.	[]
Kyle	5	0	How is that gonna help?!	[]
Cartman	21	0	Dumbass, it's November.  The History Channel is probably playing Thanksgiving specials back to back. We can learn everything we need.	[]
Other	11	0	You're watching The History Channel, where the truth is history.	[]
Other	23	0	A lot has been written about the first Thanksgiving between Pilgrims and Native Americans. but what really happened at that first historic dinner?	[]
Cartman	20	0	Dude, see? I told you. Who needs to read a bunch of stupid books when we've got History Channel?	[]
Other	33	0	We know the first Thanksgiving was in the fall of 1621, but new evidence suggests that the first exchanging of food between the Pilgrims and Native Americans may have been visited by aliens!	[]
Other	20	0	In every journal entry we researched from those early Pilgrims, not one entry mentioned anything about aliens not being there.	[]
Other	20	0	And what about the food?  Does the appearance of stuffing at the first Thanksgiving suggest a kind of alien technology?	[]
Cartman	2	0	Uh-huh??	[]
Kyle	5	0	What? This isn't history.	[]
Stan	6	0	Dude, it is called History Channel.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Yeah.)	[]
Other	37	0	And if we look in all the journals and aall the history books, there is no reference to stuffing before 1621. So where did it come from? Did it come from space? We just don't know.	[]
Other	45	0	Did ancient aliens shape the first Thanksgiving? Is it mere coincidence that Cape Cod, when viewed from space, looks like an alien life form?  What exactly did the Pilgrims experience?  How exactly did those beings from another world shape the dinner we celebrate every November?	[]
Kyle	1	0	What??	[]
Cartman	13	0	Kyle, why are you being so grumpy? Are you on your period again?	[]
Kyle	11	1	We're not basing research for our report on this crap!	['crap']
Cartman	21	0	Okay, let's take a vote: Who thinks the possibility of ancient aliens at Thanksgiving makes for an interesting history report?	[]
Kyle	1	0	Dude!	[]
Cartman	18	0	Okay, and who wants to take a little Pamprin so their menstrual cramps stop bringing everyone down? Kyle?	[]
Kyle	11	0	Alright, fine! Let's just get this stupid report over with!	[]
Other	30	0	Yes? A report from where?  Does Congress know about this yet? Try to keep it contained and get the helicopters ready. I'll be there as soon as I can.	[]
Other	1	0	Darling?	[]
Other	7	0	They found something. This could be it.	[]
Cartman	13	0	Did you guys know that when you stop menstruating it's called menopause?	[]
Stan	1	0	...What?	[]
Cartman	32	0	Yeah, God takes your period away, and apparently it makes you really irritable? I was thinking maybe that's why Kyle's been so grouchy lately, 'cause he's goin' through menopause.	[]
Kyle	5	1	Dude, shut your fuckin' mouth!	['fuckin']
Cartman	6	0	See what I mean, you guys?	[]
Other	3	0	Is that them?	[]
Other	3	0	That's them.	[]
Other	14	0	You boys have been very busy...  We need to know everything that you know.	[]
Stan	2	0	'bout what?	[]
Other	8	0	Have you been contacted by alien life forms?	[]
Other	10	0	Did you come across some kind of ship or something?	[]
Kyle	12	0	Dude, look, we, we just saw all this stuff on History Channel.	[]
Other	35	0	We are The History Channel.  For years we've been collecting information on Thanksgiving. We're getting close to the truth. And now you boys have exactly the same information. It can't be coincidence.	[]
Kyle	6	0	We saw it on your channel.	[]
Other	5	0	What exactly did you seez?!	[]
Stan	14	0	That... stuffing was never heard of before 1621, so it might be alien technology?	[]
Other	14	0	My God. Would you be willing to say that on camera for an interview?	[]
Other	24	0	Alright, Butters, that's enough MTV for one day. You need to watch something that stimulates your brain. I'm putting on History Channel.	[]
Butters	2	0	Okay Dad.	[]
Other	36	0	You're watching the History Channel, the only network dedicated to history. Coming up next, it's Monster Quest! Larrh! Followed by Hairy Bikers. Errh! But now, back to Part 3 of Ancient Aliens at Thanksgiving.	[]
Other	20	0	It has become a widely accepted fact that Thanksgiving was a meal attended by Pilgrims, Native Americans, and alien beings.	[]
Other	14	0	Stuffing wasn't mentioned anywhere until 1621? And it might have been... alien technology?	[]
Other	34	0	And while the number of people who accept the alien theory continues to grow, some experts have stepped forward with a wildly different view altogether. Could it be that Pilgrims were actually aliens themselves?	[]
Other	50	0	Of course you can't prove there were no aliens at the first Thanksgiving! Just like you can't prove that... the Pilgrims themselves weren't alien! Can you prove that?! Here: draw that Thanksgiving turkey symbol with your hand! Maybe that symbol matches... galaxies in space or something! OooOoOoOooOOO!	[]
Other	25	0	Could it be that the Pilgrims we've read about all these years actually came from another planet? History experts like Kyle Broflovski say yes.	[]
Kyle	22	0	You might as well just say Pilgrims and Indians were all aliens who came here and made some kind of intergalactic treaty!	[]
Stan	9	0	Wow, check it out dude, we're on TV.	[]
Kyle	16	0	How can they make a show out of this? I wasn't even agreeing with them.	[]
Other	4	0	What are you doing?!	[]
Kyle	2	0	...Uh oh.	[]
Other	11	0	The first Thanksgiving was a space treaty?! Native Americans are aliens?!	[]
Kyle	13	0	I was just explaining how a negative argument doesn't make a po-	[]
Other	9	1	Haven't my people been through enough?!  Goddamn you!	['goddamn']
Kyle	2	0	Ack dude!	[]
Other	9	0	The white man is gonna PAY for his lies!	[]
Other	30	0	Look at this, sir!  An aerial photograph of Cape Cod where the Pilgrims landed in 1620.  Five Pilgrim settlements, with Plymouth Rock here.  The same symbols appear everywhere in history.	[]
Other	22	0	The symbology lines up to mirrored points in space. If Kyle Broflovski is right, then Plymouth Rock is some kind of wormhole.	[]
Other	13	0	Pilgrims and Indians were the aliens! How did we not think of it?!	[]
Other	16	0	Sometimes it takes the innocence of a child to make us see the most simple things.	[]
Other	2	0	True dat.	[]
Other	2	0	True dat.	[]
Other	12	0	Get all those tourists out of here! We need this place secured!	[]
Other	17	0	Alight people, let's clear out! We need you ALL to disperse!  This area is under quarantine.	[]
Other	8	0	Give me a piece of chalk.  Huh... Nothing.	[]
Other	5	0	Guess Kyle Broflovski was wrong.	[]
Other	23	0	Well, at least we weren't outsmarted by a nine-year-old kid.  We should've known. Pilgrims couldn't be from space.	[]
Other	18	0	Here. You can see it right there. An object clearly fell from the sky and struck the Earth.	[]
Other	3	0	What is it?	[]
Other	5	0	It's a Pilgrim, sir.	[]
Other	8	0	So then, Professor Broflovski was right after all.	[]
Other	44	0	Not long ago, it was an accepted fact that civilizations on Earth shared the universe with beings from other planets.  These alien beings visited our world, and once, even settled it, from deep within the galaxy Canis Major, and a distant planet called... Plymouth.	[]
Other	24	0	Fellow Pilgrims! The great Captain hath gone missing and thine enemies have attacked our stuffing mines! We must prepare for war with the Indians!	[]
Other	16	0	Now it is OUR time! We shall attack Plymouth, and we will take... ALL THEIR STUFFING!	[]
Cartman	10	0	Non! Mom, did you already get stuffing for Thanksgiving dinner?	[]
Other	2	0	What hon?	[]
Cartman	11	0	Tell me you've already got everything we need for Thanksgiving!	[]
Other	16	0	Uhoh, Thanksgiving's still a couple of weeks away, sweetie. I haven't gone shoppies yet.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Oh no. Oh NO!	[]
Other	4	0	What is it, hon?	[]
Cartman	29	0	Clyde Donovan said that he saw on the news there's gonna be a massive stuffing shortage! Get your coat on, Mom! We've gotta go to the store!	[]
Cartman	4	0	You guys have stuffing?!	[]
Other	4	0	Stuffing? Sure. Aisle 17.	[]
Cartman	12	0	Oh... We're not too late. Mother, come!  Hey! Where is it!	[]
Other	23	0	It's right there, right on the uh...  wait, that can't be right. Hey, hey Chet. What happened to all the stuffing?	[]
Other	5	0	What are you talking about?	[]
Other	7	0	We got more in the back, right?	[]
Other	14	0	I just did inventory in the back, it... it was all put out here!	[]
Other	15	0	You mean it's two weeks until Thanksgiving and we're completely out of stuffing?!	[]
Other	2	0	Oh no!	[]
Cartman	1	0	No!	[]
Other	1	0	No!	[]
Cartman	1	0	NO!	[]
Other	11	0	You dare come to Plymouth, ambassador?! After attacking our stuffing mines?!	[]
Other	6	0	The stuffing mines were never yours!	[]
Other	17	0	Wihtout control of the mines we cannot supply stuffing to the mortals, ambassador! This will be war!	[]
Other	16	0	You are in no position to declare war! Your lead commander is nowhere to be found!	[]
Other	5	0	And how knoweth you that?!	[]
Other	6	0	Word travels fast in our sector.	[]
Other	20	0	I do not give free bowls of stuffing, what sayest you?! We will take back control of the stuffing mines!	[]
Other	7	0	Then the Thanksgiving treaty will be off!	[]
Other	14	0	And I pray to stuffing that you are wrong.  Where are you, Miles Standish?	[]
Other	36	0	And furthermore, everything Kyle Broflovski said about Native Americans being from outer space was untrue! Native Americans were brutalized, and David Sawitzky's ancestors deserve an apology! It was wrong to mix aliens and real history!	[]
Stan	18	0	I don't know, dude. Have you seen that stuff about the pyramids and the link to Mars?	[]
Kyle	9	0	Dude, there's a guy with a gun here!	[]
Stan	21	0	I'm just saying there's lots of symbols and signs out there that show aliens and history are pretty linked.	[]
Kenny	4	0	(Yeah, that's true.)	[]
Kyle	4	0	Would you guys stop!	[]
Other	5	0	Just keep writing your apology!	[]
Other	12	0	How now, Indian?! Why hast thy race sent me here to Earth?!	[]
Other	2	0	Huh?  Ack.	[]
Stan	1	0	Dude!	[]
Other	13	0	You Indians took me to thy planet, and then cast me here! Why?!	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Go, dude!)	[]
Stan	4	0	Yeah, go on dude!	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Woohoo!)	[]
Other	16	0	Hast thy race attacked our stuffing mines and sent me here to die?! Tell me, Indian!	[]
Other	8	0	I I uh I'm only one sixteenth.	[]
Other	17	0	Hold your lying tongue!  This shall prove if thou art Indian or not!  Ah, he was not.	[]
Stan	5	0	I didn't think so.	[]
Other	21	0	I have been told of your expertise, Kyle of DeVry Institute. I need your wisdom to get back to my planet.	[]
Other	14	0	Into the wheeled chariot that strucketh me!  We must make haste to Cape Cod!	[]
Stan	3	0	Who's this?	[]
Other	3	0	This is Natalie.	[]
Other	2	0	Hi guys.	[]
Other	32	0	Alright, sir. We got some more information on the Pilgrim who crashed to Earth. Thirty seconds after impact the Pilgrim was hit by a truck and then put into the back seat.	[]
Other	6	0	Who did the truck belong to?	[]
Other	8	0	We believe it belonged to Natalie Portman, sir.	[]
Other	7	0	The actress? That doesn't make sense.	[]
Other	21	0	It gets worse. All over the country people are reporting a shortage of stuffing. We don't think it's coincidence.	[]
Other	25	0	You're telling me that somehow during a stuffing shortage, this Pilgrim dropped down from space and got into a truck driven by Natalie Portman?!	[]
Other	10	0	Look, if anyone knows about stuffing, it's Natalie Portman!	[]
Other	19	0	We have to find Professor Broflovski. He was right about all of this. He'll know what to do.	[]
Other	31	0	We shall make camp here for the night. On the morrow perhaps we can reach Cape Cod. And Thanksgiving may yet be saved.  What is wrong with Kyle of DeVry Institute?	[]
Stan	19	0	Aw, I think he's just kind of pissed off he was wrong about the whole ancient alien thing.	[]
Other	25	0	He seems almost like a Puritan lady whose period hath stopped.  I fear, Kyle, that you still do not know whose side to be on.	[]
Kyle	5	0	No, ah I don't.	[]
Other	27	0	It must have been very difficult for you, being the one on your planet with his wild theories that Pilgrims and Indians were not of this world.	[]
Kyle	7	0	I actually only just said that sarcastically.	[]
Other	80	0	HA1 Ha ha ha ha ha ha!  Then you are only just a remarkably gifted child!  Here, let me show you. Your planet is one of the five.  Plymouth, Indi, Colthenheim, and this planet over here nobody really cares about.  The five are connected by a series of wormholes.  My people came to your world, and so did our enemies. But we made a treaty, and for 300 years our people have not fought. But now, the treaty is over.	[]
Kyle	22	0	But I always read that Native Americans were here, and that Pilgrims and other settlers kind of took their lands from them.	[]
Other	42	0	You can't believe what everyone tells you, Kyle. You have to open your eyes.  Soon your wisdom will open the wormhole back to Plymouth, and the stuffing mines can again be ours, for he who controls the stuffing, controls the universe.	[]
Other	4	0	Hold it right there!	[]
Other	9	0	We found Professor Broflovski! He is with the Pilgrim!	[]
Other	24	0	Stay back, all of you! For I will get to Cape Cod and cannot be stopped! Come boys! Let us fight to the death!	[]
Other	31	0	Wait! Stop, stop! Please, Mr. Standish, we are all on the same side here. We know why there's a stuffing shortage. We've been trying to get the wormhole open.	[]
Other	21	0	I trust none but them!  Indians hath betrayed us! I must return to Plymouth so my king can know the truth!	[]
Other	16	0	PLEASE!  We're the History Channel. We care as much about the truth as you do.	[]
Other	10	0	Then get us to Cape Cod as soon as possible!	[]
Other	25	0	My Lord! My Lord, the battle is lost! We have tried to stop the Indians on their home planet, but yea they are too strong!	[]
Other	8	0	Then our last chance for survival is gone?	[]
Other	17	0	I'm sorry my Lord. All Pilgrim forces sent to the Indians' planet have been wiped out.	[]
Other	16	0	And so soon the Indians will be here. Sound the corn horn! We must abandon Plymouth!	[]
Other	5	0	The stuffing mines are ours!	[]
Other	42	0	Earth is connected to Plymouth by this wormhole here. Once I get back I will assemble my people to attack Indi, and gain control of the stuffing mines. If all goes as planned, you will all have stuffing in time for Thanksgiving.	[]
Other	26	0	But Mr. Standish, I'm afraid it's not that simple. We... tried to get the wormhole open with this symbol and it didn't work.	[]
Other	21	0	Ah ha ha ha! Of course not! You have the correct symbol, but you are missing the keeper of the portal.	[]
Other	8	0	The keeper of the... of course! Natalie Portman!	[]
Other	16	0	We were wondering what she had to do with all this! Natalie Portman controls the wormhole!	[]
Other	14	0	Our window of opportunity is closing, sir! The wormhole has to be opened now!	[]
Other	10	0	Alright Ms. Portman, we need you to open your wormhole.	[]
Other	2	0	Mmmmmmmmmm. No.	[]
Other	12	0	Please, Ms. Portman, you've got to open your wormhole right now!	[]
Other	3	0	Mmmmmmm.  Uh uh.	[]
Other	13	0	Curses and cranberries! I must get to Plymouth now! Do as they say!	[]
Other	2	0	Mmmmmmmmmm. No.	[]
Other	21	0	There has to be a way to get the portal open! Where's our expert?!  What do we do, Professor Broflovski?	[]
Kyle	5	0	I'm not a professor.	[]
Other	6	0	The History Channel said you were!	[]
Kyle	6	1	You are the fucking History Channel!	['fucking']
Other	17	0	Please, Kyle of DeVry Institute. There is no more time for squabbles. The universe is at stake!	[]
Other	27	0	You knew everything else. You somehow knew about all of this. You knew it... here.  You must know... how to get Natalie Portman to open her wormhole.	[]
Kyle	12	0	So, do you uh, do you have any brothers or sisters, Natalie?	[]
Other	21	0	I had a lot of really close friends growing up, but not any brothers and sisters; I was an only child.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Wow, awesome. Um...	[]
Other	12	0	I have dual citizenship in the United States and Israel.  Oh thanks.	[]
Kyle	18	0	Um... so...  So dual citizenship, wow, uh... You know that I, I never knew anyone that had that.	[]
Other	23	0	Well, I went to Harvard while I was acting. I got a BA. But I did classes at the University of Jerusalem too.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Cool. Cool... You wanna order some dessert?	[]
Other	7	0	Thanks, that was a lot of fun.	[]
Kyle	13	0	Yeah, it was cool, thanks.  Um, so... Is there any way you'd	[]
Other	1	0	What?	[]
Kyle	4	0	You know, could youuu...	[]
Other	1	0	What?	[]
Kyle	7	0	Would you please just open your wormhole?!	[]
Other	3	0	Oh.  Mmmm...  no.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Errh!	[]
Other	2	0	Mmmmmmmmmm. Okay.	[]
Other	1	0	Yes!	[]
Other	5	0	Alright, let's go, folks!	[]
Other	5	0	Just for a sec though.	[]
Other	17	0	Thank you, Kyle of DeVry Institute. Now the Indians can be stopped and Thanksgiving will be saved!	[]
Kyle	24	0	Yeeah, you're welcome. I'm sorry I doubted you. And guys, I'm I'm sorry I acted like a know-it-all.	[]
Stan	6	0	It's cool dude, we understand.	[]
Kyle	17	0	I guess we should all realize...  that history and alien technology really do go hand in hand.	[]
Other	13	0	Now make way, children! For I have a war to fight!  For stuffing!!	[]
Other	4	0	Take ALL their stuffing!	[]
Other	4	0	The treaty ends now!	[]
Other	16	0	With the wormhole once again open, Miles Standish was finally able to command a Pilgrim army.	[]
Other	16	0	Now attack their left flank! Good! They're retreating! Hit them with the anti-Indian device!	[]
Other	16	0	The Pilgrims fought off the Indians, making stuffing once again available on all our Thanksgiving tables.	[]
Other	4	0	Yea. Stuffing mines. Yea.	[]
Other	9	0	And now you know the true story behind Thanksgiving.	[]
Stan	11	0	Wow, there's a lot about Thanksgiving I never knew before.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Yeah, History Channel rules.	[]
Other	31	0	But was the first Thanksgiving really just about Pilgrims and Indians from space? Or was there something more? Shocking new evidence suggests that the first Thanksgiving might also have been...  haunted!	[]
Other	13	0	There is certainly no evidence that the first Thanksgiving dinner was not haunted.	[]
Other	16	0	The Pilgrims welcomed the Indians, but did they also unknowingly welcome spirits from beyond the grave?	[]
Cartman	1	0	Uhhh??	[]
Kyle	3	0	Oh, come on!!	[]
