Other	8	0	Don't forget to buy your souvenirs, folks.	[]
Stan	13	1	Damn, dude, do you see how much money this place is raking in?	['damn']

Randy	6	0	You're from Cirque du Cheville.	[]

Randy	11	0	Heh, it's 11 o'clock and she's still sleeping.	[]
Other	5	0	Poor dear must be tired.	[]

Kyle	7	0	But there's only four of you.	[]
Other	10	0	No no, Natalia is just playing mirror buddies with Nadia.	[]
Other	1	0	Hello.	[]
Kyle	12	0	So if you're identical, does that mean you all think alike?	[]
Other	5	0	No, don't be ridiculous.	[]
Stan	9	0	Will you guys be in our Cirque du Celville?	[]
Other	4	0	You have your own?	[]
Stan	11	0	Well, not yet. Kenny has to get better at singing first.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Hey!)	[]
Cartman	14	0	But as soon as he starts singing better, we're all gonna make bank!	[]
Other	1	0	Okay.	[]
Other	2	0	Sounds good.	[]

Other	1	0	Okay.	[]
Other	3	0	...Oh, and me.	[]

Randy	5	0	No, Dad, she's dead!	[]
Other	4	0	What?!  Oh, dear Jesus!	[]
Randy	8	0	It looks like she had a heart attack.	[]
Other	8	0	No wonder she didn't say good-night.	[]
Randy	1	0	...Ew!	[]
Stan	5	0	Okay, hold it, hold it.	[]
Other	1	0	Ow!	[]

Cartman	8	0	You guys, come here.  This is totally awesome.	[]
Stan	1	0	What?!	[]
Kyle	5	0	How can you say that?	[]
Cartman	16	1	Because now we can convince them to stay here, and now our circus will kick ass!	['ass']
Kyle	2	0	Oh, yeah!	[]
Stan	11	0	Mom! Dad! Can the quints stay with us? Please? Can they?	[]
Randy	7	0	Well, Stan, it's not really our-	[]
Stan	7	0	They have nowhere else to go.  Please?	[]
Other	13	0	Well, for the time being I, I mean, of course they can stay.	[]
Other	1	0	Hooray!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Hooray!	[]
Other	82	0	Tom, I'm standing at the home in South Park where five precious little girls have been rescued from Romania. Their mother passes away some months ago, and then their grandmother died trying to bring them here. But all is well now, and people are coming from all over the country to view the little tykes.  If you'd like to come down and visit the quintuplets, admission is only $5, and for a few dollars more , you can feed them fishsticks.	[]
Other	1	0	Mmm.	[]
Other	21	0	Tom, it looks like these cute little girls have made it out of that armpit of a country they call Romania.	[]
Other	22	1	Yes, luckily for them, these quintuplets no longer have to live in Romania, the asshole of the world.  Back to you, Tom.	['asshole']
Other	12	0	This is not good. It makes our country look poor and stupid.	[]
Other	5	0	This could kill our tourism.	[]
Other	5	0	You know what to do.	[]
Other	10	0	Alright, Kenny, let's start with some warm-up exercises.	[]
Kenny	7	0	(Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha)	[]
Other	13	0	Well, what do you think? Can you help him become a better singer?	[]
Other	13	0	Well, he's got potential. Depends on how good he wants to be.	[]
Kenny	5	0	(I wanna be really good)	[]
Other	22	0	Well, if you wanna be a real singer, you need to go to a conservatory in Europe. There's no other alternative.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Europe?)	[]
Other	5	0	We can't afford that.	[]
Other	12	0	Well, then, I'm afraid your son will always be a hack.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Awww.)	[]
Other	26	0	Well, Kenny, if it means that much to you, maybe we can bus it to Europe and... you can sing on the way to make money.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Yeah.)	[]
Other	9	0	Randy, Randy, you'd better have look at this.	[]
Randy	1	0	What?	[]
Other	16	0	...until the U.S. government receives this video, which was sent from Romania just hours ago.	[]
Other	17	0	Hello. This is Romanian father. I am desperate to have my girls returned to me in Romania.	[]
Randy	2	0	Uh-oh.	[]
Stan	4	0	That's your dad?	[]
Other	1	0	Maybe.	[]
Other	11	0	But we haven't seen papa for more than five years.	[]
Other	8	0	How I've missed them all. Little Nahlal.	[]
Other	1	0	Nadia!	[]
Other	4	0	Nadia, my sweet Barshta	[]
Other	1	0	Baltania!	[]
Other	21	0	Baltania, eh anyway, my heart is aching for their return. I, I know the American government will do what's right.	[]
Kyle	19	0	Hoh no, dude. If they get sent back to Romania, we'll never get our Cirque dei Ceville going.	[]
Stan	11	0	Mom, Dad, you're not gonna send them back, are you??	[]
Other	9	0	Well, I... think we... have to,... don't we?	[]
Randy	4	0	I don't know.	[]
Kyle	14	0	You don't wanna go back to stinky Romania, do you? It sucks there.	[]
Cartman	18	0	Yeah. America is sooo much cooler. In Romania they just oppress you and try to bring you down.	[]
Other	15	0	We'll have to call the police and see what they want us to do.	[]
Cartman	5	1	Damn, we might be screwed.	['damn']
Stan	20	1	No! We've just gotta convince these chicks that America kicks the ass out of every other country. Come on!	['ass']
Cartman	14	0	You see, in America we have... log rides!  Bacon double-cheeseburgers!  Sheep-shearing contests!	[]
Other	4	0	Yeah. Woo hoohoohoo. Yeah.	[]
Cartman	4	0	And shopping malls! Hooray!	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Woo hoo!)	[]
Other	13	0	Mrs. Janet Reno, you must understand, the father has right to his children.	[]
Other	25	0	Yes, but the girls seem to wanna stay here. Why don't you all stay here in America, and this whole thing can go away.	[]
Other	2	0	Okay.  Heh!	[]
Other	8	0	Our home is Romania. We love it there.	[]
Other	7	0	Ah, yes, uwuh we love it there.	[]
Other	14	0	If daughters will not return on their own, you must force them to return	[]
Other	16	0	Gentlemen, this has to be handled very delicately. You don't understand Americans' power to protest.	[]
Other	1	0	Protest?	[]
Other	23	0	Look, people have it so good in America that they get bored very easily. And when people get bored they start protesting things.	[]
Other	1	0	Oh.	[]
Other	27	0	But I want to assure you, and the Romanian people, that we are going to do everything in our power to make this as confusing as possible.	[]
Other	14	2	Let the quints stay! Romania is gay! Let the quints stay! Romania is gay!	['gay', 'gay']
Other	12	0	Fur is murder! Fur is murder!  Oh, what are we protesting here?	[]
Other	2	0	Romania sucks!	[]
Other	9	0	Oh, let's see  Here we go. Romania sucks!	[]
Other	4	0	Romania sucks! Romania sucks!	[]
Other	16	0	Oh my God! I didn't know this was going to become such a big deal.	[]
Randy	16	0	That'll teach us for taking an old lady and her granddaughters out of the cold.	[]
Other	28	0	Attention, people inside the house!  You must return the quintuplets to their father! You have until...  Oh yeah, that's good.  You have until Easter Sunday to comply.	[]
Other	1	0	Nooo!	[]
Other	1	0	Boooo!	[]
Other	1	0	What?!	[]
Stan	7	0	Okay, let's try it again. Hup!	[]
Other	1	0	Hup!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Alright!	[]
Randy	2	0	Stan, we-	[]
Other	17	0	Stanley, we have some bad news. The courts have decided the girls must go back to Romania.	[]
Stan	15	0	No, they can't! We've convinced them that they want to stay in America.	[]
Kyle	18	0	Yeah, we've shown them amusement parks and malls. How can you expect them to go back now??	[]
Randy	23	0	I'm sorry, boys, but Janet Reno is having them taken away on Easter Sunday. We... don't have a choice. Sorry, girls.	[]
Stan	5	0	Now what do we do?	[]
Other	38	0	Tom, it is now Easter morning, and as the U.S. government promised, they are here to take the girls back to their father in Romania. Rumor has it that Janet Reno herself will be extraditing the quintuplets.	[]
Other	9	0	Alright, Ms. Reno, let's go over the plan.	[]
Other	1	0	Right.	[]
Other	29	0	We'll drop you on the northwest corner of the backyard. You hop into the back of the house and find the quintuplets. When you see them, you say...	[]
Other	7	0	Hello, girls. I'm the Easter bunny.	[]
Other	15	0	Good. And then hand them the Easter eggs filled with tear gas. Are you ready?	[]
Other	1	0	Ready.	[]
Other	2	0	Code blue!	[]
Other	2	0	Code blue!	[]
Other	15	0	Lad, we would like very much to have you here at the Romanian Music School.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Woohoo!)	[]
Other	7	0	How much is all this gonna cost?	[]
Other	26	1	Don't worry, Ms. McCormick, Romania is very poor country. Apartment is cheap. Food is cheap, Everything is cheap because we are so God-damned poor.	['damned']
Other	10	0	Yes, your two hundred American dollars will last months here.	[]
Other	10	0	Wow, what a great country. Everybody's poor, like us.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Yeah.)	[]
Other	17	0	Hello, girls. I'm the Easter bunny.  Happy Easter, kids. Come see what I brought for ya.	[]
Other	8	1	Hey, Terrance, I think I have to fart.	['fart']
Other	7	0	Wait. Before you do, pull my thumb.	[]
Other	5	0	Oh, look. An Easter egg.	[]
Randy	2	0	Oh, shi-	[]
Other	16	0	That's it. Let's move, move move move, move!  Give us the kids, now! Now!	[]
Other	11	1	Down on the floor. Get down on the God-damned floor!	['damned']
Other	2	0	Find them!	[]
Other	18	0	This is a bust! Hand over the quints!  Hand over the children! Happy Easter. Hand over the children!!	[]
Other	6	1	What the hell's goin' on?!	['hell']

Other	6	1	Pull the trigger, you little pussy!	['pussy']
Other	1	0	Gaahhh!	[]

Other	2	0	Down! Down!	[]
Other	2	0	Riot! Riot!	[]
Other	4	0	Pepper spray! Pepper spray!	[]
Other	5	0	Go ahead! In the van!	[]
Stan	10	1	Dammit, now I'm never gonna have my own circus!	['dammit']
Other	14	0	Oh, your son is so talented, Ms. McCormick. The people of Romania love him.	[]
Other	3	0	Good job, Kenny.	[]
Other	21	0	Mrs. McCormick, we would love for you and your son to stay here in Romania, with us. Will you consider it?	[]
Other	17	0	Well, what do you think, Kenny? You'd have to leave your friends and your family behind.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Sure!)	[]
Other	1	0	Alright!	[]
Other	9	0	Oh, Randy, it's gone! It's all gone!	[]
Cartman	5	1	Dude, what the hell happened?	['hell']
Stan	14	0	The government came and got the quintuplets. No more Cirque du Cheville for us.	[]
Kyle	17	1	Damnit! How come every time we get a sweet idea, the government has to screw it up?!	['damnit']
Stan	5	0	Yeah! Well, not this time!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Huh?	[]

But they haven't won yet! I say we all go over to the mayor's office, and demand to see the quintuplets right now!	['bastards']

Other	8	0	Yeah, ah, do we get overtime for this?	[]
Stan	7	0	Uh, sure, you can all get overtime.	[]
Other	1	0	Alright!	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Other	3	0	Down with Japan!	[]
Other	23	0	Alright. We just need to get a few more pictures of the girls reunited with their father so everyone knows they're happy.	[]
Other	39	0	Come on, girls. Smile.  We want you to look happy. Smile.  Look at the silly frog. Who's got the silly frog? Look at him. I've got- Look at him. It's so silly. I'm so silly.	[]
Other	50	0	Ah, hello? This is Kenny's dad, back in America. I miss my son very much. I would like to see him returned to me so that the U.S. government will buy me a new car and-  Ow! I mean, bec- because I miss my son very much.  Man.	[]

Cartman	4	0	Yeah, you suck, dude!	[]
