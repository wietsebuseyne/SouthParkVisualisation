Other	10	0	I'd never seen any of those men, Officer Barbrady.	[]
Other	15	0	No, I didn't think so. Mind if I look around the back yard, though?	[]
Other	6	0	Why would you wanna do that?	[]
Other	28	0	Well, I'm checking everyone's back yards. Missing people usually turn up hiding in someone's bushes. May I?  Well, this all looks in-  oh? Tennis anyone?	[]
Other	11	0	Nobody's going to take my baby away from me! Nobody!	[]
Other	17	0	Okay, Mrs. Marsh, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you a few questions.	[]

Chef	26	0	Oh. Well, uh, don't worry, Stan. I'm sure it'll work out. Now, what's the other problem?  Oh, nohoho.  Oh, DEAR GOD, NO!	[]
Cartman	19	1	...and them I saw them all at the bus stop, and this son of a bitch is standing there!	['bitch']
Other	16	0	I'm sorry I caused so much trouble. This is all very strange to me, too.	[]
Chef	5	0	Exactly what do you remember?	[]
Other	24	0	Well, I was just standing around, and Stan and Kyle were being really mean, as usual, and Kenny had just bought a new car.	[]
Chef	5	0	Of course! That's it!	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Chef	19	0	Don't you see, children? This Cartman is from an evil, parallel universe where everything exists as its opposite!	[]
Cartman	25	1	He's my evil twin? But he doesn't even look that much like me; he's all fat and stuff. He's hella lying.	['fat']
Kyle	6	0	Will you stop saying that word?!	[]
Stan	13	0	Of course! My pet goldfish must be from the evil, opposite universe, too!	[]
Chef	15	0	Children, somewhere in South Park, something has created a door to the evil, parallel universe!	[]
Other	12	0	This is amazing! I can't believe how nice you are, Chef.	[]
Chef	4	0	How do you mean?	[]
Other	10	0	In my world, you're a skinny, white insurance salesman.	[]

Cartman	5	0	Dude, this is hella cool.	[]
Stan	8	0	Aunt Flo, where did you get this goldfish?	[]
Other	10	0	Nn-oh.  I got it from the pet store, Stanley.	[]
Stan	6	0	Do you remember what pet store?	[]
Other	18	0	Let's see. I believe it was called The Indian Burial Ground Pet Store, just outside of town.	[]
Stan	1	0	Where?	[]
Other	12	0	I know I have the address written down somewhere.  Let me look.	[]
Stan	16	0	That's it, dude. We've gotta take the spooky fish back to that pet store.	[]

Other	5	0	I'll help you, Stan.	[]
Cartman	6	1	Shut your god-damned mouth, fatass!	['damned']
Kyle	17	0	Dude. Are you sure that fish is a murderer? It seemed like a normal fish to me.	[]
Stan	17	0	Just help me take it back. Come on!  Did you find the address, Aunt Flo- Aunt Flo!	[]
Other	6	0	Oh, Stanley, no! Not Aunt Flo!	[]
Stan	4	0	It was the fish!	[]
Other	11	0	Oh, what a good baby. What a good son I have.	[]
Stan	10	0	Now we'll never know where that pet store is!	[]
Kyle	12	0	There can't be that many pet stores in South Park, dude.	[]
Stan	17	0	Aunt Flo isn't from South Park. The pet store could be anywhere between here and Denver.	[]
Kyle	20	0	Well, we'd better get working. Cartman, you go home and call all the pet stores in the phone book.	[]
Other	2	0	Can do!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Screw you!	[]
Other	20	0	It's all taken care of, Stanley- G'oh!  I've got such a good boy, such a handsome boy!	[]
Stan	8	0	Come on, we're running out of time.	[]
Randy	7	0	Hey, why is the basement door locked?	[]
Other	25	0	-crack corn and I don't careJimmy crack corn and I don't careMy master's gone awayJimmy crack corn and I don't care	[]

Other	14	0	Stanley. Kenny's mother is here. She's wondering if you've seen Kenny.	[]
Other	10	0	You saw him, didn't you?  You saw my boy.	[]
Stan	3	0	Yeah, my goldfish-.	[]
Other	20	0	Yeah. Stan just got a new goldfish and he wanted to show it to Kenny but, Kenny never came over.	[]
Other	18	0	My Kenny used to laugh and play. He was eight years old, just like you, my Kenny was.	[]
Stan	2	0	I know.	[]
Other	14	0	You've gotta tell me what happened to him!  You have to know something!	[]
Other	16	0	Mrs. McCormick, I'm going to have to ask you to leave! You've been drinking!	[]
Other	27	0	That's right, I'm a little drunk.  You'd be drunk, too, if you'd lost your boy.  My Kenny used to sing and dance, eh.	[]
Other	7	0	You guys, I found the pet store!	[]
Stan	26	1	Come on, let's go!  Mom, I know you think I did all this, but I'm gonna prove to you it was this fucking fish!	['fucking']
Other	13	0	I believe you, sweetheart.  Run from him, boys. Run and don't stop!	[]
Other	5	0	Can I help you boys?	[]
Stan	5	0	I wanna return a fish.	[]
Other	2	1	Damn it!	['damn']
Kyle	1	0	What?	[]
Other	26	0	That's the ninth return I've had this week! What's wrong with it?  Ap! Let me guess. It killed a bunch of people, right?	[]
Stan	2	0	Yeah, dude.	[]
Other	8	1	Damn it!  Just like all the other returns!	['damn']
Kyle	12	0	Dude, why is your store called The Indian Burial Ground Pet Store?	[]
Other	12	0	Well, there was an Indian burial ground here before I bought it.	[]
Stan	13	0	So you just- built your store on top of an Indian burial ground?	[]
Other	19	1	Oh, hell no! First I dug up all the bodies, pissed on 'em, then buried them again upside down.	['hell']
Kyle	1	0	Why?	[]
Other	8	0	Why? I don't know. I was drunk.	[]
Stan	17	0	We think that when you did that, you opened up a doorway to an evil, parallel universe.	[]
Other	7	0	Well, that certainly would explain a lot.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Like what?	[]
Other	12	1	Well, like this.  I've been wondering what the hell this was.	['hell']
Other	12	0	Hello, Mr. Marsh. Top of the evening to you.  Okay, bye, then.	[]
Randy	1	0	Sharon?	[]
Other	2	0	Yyes, hon?	[]
Randy	10	0	There's a policeman being held captive in our basement.	[]
Other	23	0	Yes, hon. I had to restrain him so he wouldn't find the bodies in the back yard and take our baby away.	[]
Randy	16	0	Why'd you take his pants off?  Sh-sharon, why'd you take his- pants off?	[]
Other	11	0	Oh, Randy, I just don't know what to do anymore.	[]
Randy	3	0	What is it?	[]
Other	21	0	I just ughhhh, I can't believe that Aunt Flo is gone, that she won't be visiting me ever again.	[]
Randy	33	0	Oh. Wuwell, don't- think of it as an end, think of it as a new beginning. Now, could you fill me in on the dead bodies and captive policeman stuff real quick?	[]
Stan	15	0	Look, pal. This is very simple. All I want to do is return this fish.	[]
Other	8	0	I can't give you your money back.	[]
Stan	13	0	I don't care, dude! I just want this fish away from me!	[]
Other	7	0	No! I won't take it back!	[]
Other	53	0	Listen, friend. You can't sell people pets like this. You have to have a sign that says, Warning: these fish are from an evil, parallel universe. Now, it's not our fault you disrespected the bodies of this land's native people, but by golly , you're gonna take this fish back.	[]
Other	4	0	All right, you win.	[]
Stan	4	0	Wow! Thanks, evil Cartman!	[]
Other	21	0	And sir, can I make a suggestion?  Move your store, and let these great people of the Wampanoag rest in peace.	[]
Kyle	5	1	You kick ass, evil Cartman!	['ass']
Stan	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Kyle	31	0	You know what I like best about you? You don't say, hella, like our Cartman does. I swear, if he says that one more time, I'm gonna kill him!	[]
