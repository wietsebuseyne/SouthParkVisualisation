Stan	8	0	Dude, what's your little brother doing here?	[]
Kyle	8	0	Ike is starting his first day of kindergarten.	[]
Stan	8	0	But isn't he only three years old?	[]
Kyle	16	0	Yeah, but he's some kind of genius, so he's getting advanced placement in kindergarten.	[]
Ike	4	0	I pooped my pants.	[]
Kyle	29	0	But dude, check out my new Trapper Keeper.  It has five different compartments for each subject in school,  and it's all covered with pictures from Dawson's Creek.	[]
Stan	1	0	Cool!	[]
Cartman	61	0	Hey, dudes. Check out my sweet Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Ultra Keeper Futura 2000.  Yeah, well,  it's got ten different compartments for every subject in school, an electronic pencil sharpener, four plastic bags with electronic zippers, copy machine, fax, a better picture of Dawson's Creek on the back than Kyle's,  flat-screen TV, and of course, OnStar.	[]
Stan	2	0	Wow, cool!	[]
Kyle	16	1	Goddammit, Cartman! You only got that because you knew my mom would buy it for me!	['goddammit']
Cartman	26	1	Oh, but you have a Trapper Keepe-- Oh, you got the little Crapper Keeper, didn't you? Well, at least your stupid brother got a briefcase.	['crapper']
Kyle	10	0	He's going to kindergarten because he's a genius!	[]
Cartman	10	1	He's not a genius; he's a little douchebag.	['douchebag']
Ike	4	0	I pooped my pants!	[]
Kyle	21	1	He's smarter than you, fat boy! I don't even know how you made it into fourth grade! I thought--	['fat']
Cartman	16	0	Trapper Keeper, I need to drown out my annoying friend. Please initiate music, country, high volume.	[]
Kyle	9	1	Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman!	['crap']
Stan	11	0	Ms. Crabtree, there's another creepy homeless guy on the bus.	[]
Other	5	0	Sit down and shut up!!	[]
Stan	5	0	But they smell like pee.	[]
Other	13	0	I am not a homeless person. I am a new fourth-grade student.	[]
Kyle	2	0	You are?	[]
Other	7	0	Yes! My name is Bill. Bill Cosby.	[]
Stan	11	0	Aren't you a little old to be in grade school?	[]
Other	17	0	I was held back ten human grades.  I mean, grades. Do you companion-friends know Eric Cartman?	[]
Cartman	4	0	Yeah, that's me.	[]
Other	14	0	Eric Cartman?  And you have a Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Futura S 2000?	[]
Cartman	6	0	Yeahhh, you already know about it?	[]
Other	4	0	Yes. Yes, I do.	[]
Cartman	10	1	Well...  Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman!	['crap']
Kyle	9	1	I'm gonna shove that thing up your ass!	['ass']
Stan	14	0	Dude, do you really care if Cartman has something that's better than yours?	[]
Kyle	8	0	No, I don't! I don't care!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Here, Kyle.	[]
Other	18	0	Hey, there he is. That's the kid that's s'posed to be some kind of genius.	[]
Other	11	0	Yeah, he's only three and he's already in kindergarten.	[]
Other	32	0	Come on.  So, you think you're smarter than the rest of us? Do you think you know more about the world just because you are only 3 and we're 5?	[]
Ike	2	0	Unkoo baba.	[]
Mr. Garrison	120	0	Okay, children, let's take our seats.  My name is Mr. Garrison, and I'm the new kindergarten teacher. I used to be the third grade teacher, but I had a little  nervous breakdown and went into the mountains where I lived off of rat carcasses.  But I'm all better now, and the school was nice enough to let me go on teaching, as long as it was for kindergarten.  But it's not a demotion. No. I mean, just because a teacher was teaching third grade and now is teaching kindergarten, that's not a demotion, is it?  No, that's right, it's not. Well, let's start with roll call. Uh, let's see. Filmore Anderson?	[]
Other	1	0	Here.	[]
Mr. Garrison	2	0	Sally Bands?	[]
Other	1	0	Here.	[]
Mr. Garrison	2	0	Ike Broflovski?	[]
Ike	2	0	Cookie Monster.	[]
Mr. Garrison	42	0	Broflovski, I had your older brother Kyle in my third-grade class. He's a very smart kid. I'm sure you are, too.  Well that's bad news for everybody else, because I will be grading you all on a curve.	[]
Cartman	37	0	And so the other thing that makes my Trapper Keeper cooler than Kyle's is that it can add any peripheral device to itself automatically.  I can take something as simple as this calculator  and... Trapper Keeper?	[]
Other	3	0	Trapper Keeper active.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Hybrid with Wellington Bear calculator.	[]
Other	3	0	Ready for hybrid.	[]
Cartman	9	0	And now it can use Wellington Bear calculator, too.	[]
Other	1	0	Wow.	[]
Other	6	0	May I hold your Trapper Keeper?	[]
Cartman	37	0	Uh, n-no, I'm afraid not, Bill Cosby, because it is coded to the prints on my fingers.  If anybody but me tries to hold it, big metal spikes come out and pierce through their hands.	[]
Kyle	14	1	Oh, you are so full of crap, Cartman! Metal spikes will not come out!	['crap']
Cartman	25	0	Oh really?  Then, why don't you hold it?  Well, go on, Kyle. If it doesn't have metal spikes, then hold it.  Hold it.	[]
Kyle	3	0	I'm gonna!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Hold it.	[]
Kyle	2	0	I will!	[]
Mr. Garrison	56	0	And that's how the relationship with my father sort of ended. There's still some sort of skeletons in the closet, but things between us are a little better.  Okay, children, well now it's time for us to elect a class president,  so first we must pick nominees.  Who would like to nominate someone?	[]
Other	12	0	I nominate Filmore, because he's the smartest kid in the class.	[]
Mr. Garrison	13	0	Okay, Filmore.  You'll be our first nominee. And who else?  Yes, Jenny.	[]
Other	4	0	I gotta go doodie.	[]
Mr. Garrison	40	0	In a minute, Jenny. Who else wants to nominate a class president?  Oh, come on! You can't have an election with just one person running! What's the fun in that? Ike? How about you? You're a genius.	[]
Ike	1	0	No.	[]
Mr. Garrison	25	0	Okay, our second nominee is Ike the genius.  Okay, children, now we'll hear briefly from each nominee. Filmore, why don't you go first?	[]
Other	26	0	If I'm elected class president, I'll call for big ol' chairs. And on Fridays, I'll add two minutes to nap time. Thank you.	[]
Mr. Garrison	7	0	Very enthralling. Okay, Ike? How about you?	[]
Ike	3	0	Cookie Monster. Ice.	[]
Mr. Garrison	9	0	...Well, this is gonna be a tough one, kids.	[]
Stan	9	0	Oh, no, dude, here comes that weird new kid.	[]
Other	12	0	Ahhh, hello Eric. Can I be your human friend?  I mean, friend?	[]
Cartman	25	0	I don't know, dude. I'm not supposed to have any male friends that are over 30. I kind of screwed on that once.	[]
Other	16	0	Please. We can have fun and play games, like human four square--  I mean, four square.	[]
Cartman	34	0	Dude, you can't just ask to be somebody's friend and be their friend; it doesn't work that way. If you want to be my friend, you'll have to pay me.	[]
Other	19	0	Oh, I see. Alright, I'll pay 100 geliga stones-- Uh, I mean, human dollars! Eugh, I mean dollars!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Okay, that's cool.	[]
Other	6	0	Can we play some human tetherball?	[]
Cartman	15	0	A-alright. Pretty sweet, you guys, getting a hundred bucks to play tetherball with some--	[]
Other	1	0	Serve!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Ugh..!	[]
Other	2	0	Got it!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Ey!	[]
Stan	9	0	Dude! He's running off with your Trapper Keeper!	[]
Other	2	0	Waa-agggh!	[]
Cartman	18	1	You son of a bitch!  Wait a minute.  Lucky for me, I have my Trapper Keeper homing device.	['bitch']
Stan	5	1	What the hell just happened?	['hell']
Kyle	9	1	Damn! I thought fourth grade was gonna be different.	['damn']
Mr. Garrison	42	0	So that's six votes for Filmore and six votes for Ike.  And the last vote is for... Uh, let's see. Flora, I can't tell who you voted for.  You've got the winning vote, Flora. Who d'you pick?	[]
Other	4	0	I don't know...	[]
Mr. Garrison	9	0	Flora, you have to pick one. Filmore or Ike?	[]
Other	8	0	Um, I vote for... I don't know.	[]
Mr. Garrison	26	0	Oh, great! Flora's undecided! Well, you're just gonna have to sit there, Flora, and think about it until you come up with an answer.	[]
Other	1	0	Okay.	[]
Other	13	0	Flora, just say you vote for Filmore so we can all go home.	[]
Other	1	0	Um...	[]
Other	7	0	No! You want Ike to be president.	[]
Other	14	0	We're gonna be here all night! Why don't you guys just concede?	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Other	6	0	Why don't you just concede?	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Other	1	0	Filmore!	[]
Other	1	0	Ike!	[]
Other	6	0	I want Ike to be president!	[]
Mr. Garrison	14	0	Oh, for Christ's sakes, you're all acting like a bunch o' kids!	[]
Cartman	11	0	Turn left here! We're getting close! Get your gun ready!	[]
Other	12	0	Eric, I'm not gonna shoot anybody for taking your school folder.	[]
Cartman	22	0	It was not a school folder, it was a Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Futura S 2000! And if--  There he is!	[]
Other	1	0	Wagh!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Got ya!	[]
Other	1	0	Hey!	[]
Other	1	0	Gaagghhh!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Whoa, dude..!	[]
Cartman	9	0	Ahh, try to take my Trapper Keeper, will you?	[]
Other	5	0	Please. You do not understand.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Book him, Barbrady. Another job well done.	[]
Other	7	0	That Trapper Keeper has to be destroyed!	[]
Stan	12	0	Why are you so obsessed with Cartman's Trapper Keeper, Bill Cosby?	[]
Other	2	0	Bill Cosby?	[]
Other	26	0	Nooo! Listen to me! I am not really Bill Cosby.  My name is BSM-471. I am a cyborg engineered by humans from the year 2034.	[]
Other	8	0	Well, I knew you weren't Bill Cosby!	[]
Other	171	0	I have come to destroy that Trapper Keeper, because it was the Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper that belongs to an Eric Cartman in South Park which three years from now manifests itself into an omnipotent super being, and destroys all of humanity. In the year 2004, a hybrid-assimilating computer linked with a satellite uplink computer. From there it was able to slowly take over every computer in the world.  It became stronger and stronger, until by the year 2018 it broke away from mankind  and there was nothing the humans could do.  It wasn't long before Mighty Trapper Keeper started to destroy everything it saw as useless, including humans.  The nations tried everything to stop it.  Nuclear devices, seismic missiles. But nothing worked.  The humans built robots of their own, whole armies of them.  But nothing was strong enough to stop Trapper Keeper.  And so finally, the humans decided to send one of their robots into the past to destroy the Trapper Keeper before it even got started.	[]
Stan	4	0	Wow, that's amazing.	[]
Kyle	13	0	Man, I guess sometimes we let our technology and stuff grow too fast.	[]
Stan	6	0	What do you think, Officer Barbrady?	[]
Other	9	0	Huh? Oh, I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.	[]
Other	13	0	And so, Eric. Now you see why we must destroy your Trapper Keeper.	[]
Cartman	15	0	You guys. Did I mention that it has a pencil sharpener and a crayon sharpener?	[]
Stan	11	0	Cartman, it takes over the world and destroy all of humanity!	[]
Cartman	25	0	What would you guys have me do, huh?! Walk around with just a plain old Trapper Keeper like Kyle's?! Is that what you want?!	[]
Stan	1	0	Yes!	[]
Cartman	21	1	Aw, damnit!  Here! Take it! You want my heart as well?! You'll find it on the bottom of your shoes!	['damnit']
Other	2	0	I decided.	[]
Mr. Garrison	10	0	Oh, thank God, Flora!  Alright, who do you vote for?	[]
Other	2	0	Umm... Ike.	[]
Other	1	0	Yay!	[]
Mr. Garrison	21	0	Okay, so then the total is six for Filmore and now seven votes for Ike. Ike is the new class president.	[]
Other	4	0	We want a recount.	[]
Mr. Garrison	1	0	What?	[]
Other	4	0	Recount! Recount! Recount! Recount!	[]
Mr. Garrison	50	0	Oh, of all the juvenile things I've ever heard! You lost, Filmore! Don't be such a baby!  Alright, alright, I'll count up the ballots again. Okay, we had one vote for Filmore...  ...And this time, I again get six votes for Filmore and seven votes for Ike.	[]
Other	3	0	Count them again.	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Mr. Garrison	45	0	No, children! I've recounted 106 times now and I keep coming up with seven to six! Except in the one instance where it came out seven to five, and one where it came out twelve to fourteen. It's over! Ike is class president!	[]
Other	7	0	Wait, there's still that absent kid.	[]
Other	12	0	Yeah. If Carlos is absent, we have to wait for his vote.	[]
Mr. Garrison	5	0	Oh, will you grow up?!	[]
Other	9	0	Absent kids count! Absent kids count! Absent kids count!	[]
Mr. Garrison	18	0	Jesus..! Alright, we'll wait for tomorrow so the absent kid can cast his vote. Now go home!	[]
Other	3	0	Good morning, humans.	[]
Other	3	0	Hey, Bill Cosby.	[]
Other	32	0	I have successfully destroyed Eric Cartman's Trapper Keeper. I broke it apart, dipped the motherboards in acid, burned the memory chips, and sent the wiring to the four corners of Canada.	[]
Kyle	4	0	That should do it.	[]
Stan	15	1	So what are you going to do with your crappy robot life now, Bill Cosby?	['crappy']
Other	41	0	Well, that is a problem that is causing me some disconcernment. I am still here, but I shouldn't be here. If Trapper Keeper has been stopped, then I should not exist. But here I am. Something is still not right.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Hey, dudes.	[]
Stan	7	0	Cartman! You still got a Trapper Keeper!	[]
Cartman	49	0	Yeah, I'm a genius! Last night I went home and told my mom that I lost the last one. Then I cried and I cried, and finally she felt so bad that she took me to the store and bought me a new one!  So everything worked out.	[]
Other	2	0	Oh no!	[]
Kyle	10	0	Cartman, you dumbass! You can't get a new one!	[]
Cartman	4	1	Why the hell not?!	['hell']
Stan	21	0	Because if your Trapper Keeper takes over the world, then maybe it was this Trapper Keeper and not the one before!	[]
Cartman	12	0	Wait... so then you guys burned my last one for no reason!	[]
Other	8	0	We will have to destroy this Trapper Keeper.	[]
Cartman	15	0	But I don't think I can get my mom to buy me another one.	[]
Kyle	14	2	Don't you get it?! You can't have any Trapper Keepers, fat ass!	['fat', 'ass']
Cartman	56	1	Oh, that is bullcrap! And you know what I think? I think this whole thing is a setup! That's right! Kyle got this guy to say that he's a robot from the future just because he's jealous of my Trapper Keeper! And you know what else? Screw you guys. I'm going home.	['bullcrap']
Stan	1	0	Cartman!	[]
Cartman	5	0	Ech! Screw you guys. Home.	[]
Other	4	0	Well, that does it!	[]
Kyle	5	0	Hey! What are you doing?	[]
Other	18	0	I'm afraid I have no other choice.  For the sake of humanity, I have to kill him.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Oh... Okay.	[]
Stan	6	0	Yeah, that's fine.  No, wait!	[]
Other	1	0	What?	[]
Stan	4	0	Can I do it?	[]
Other	4	0	Oh, well, I suppose.	[]
Stan	7	2	Sweet! Kiss your ass goodbye, fat boy!	['ass', 'fat']
Other	24	0	Wait!  Perhaps there is another way. If you could take me to where Eric Cartman lives, I could try reasoning with his human mother.	[]
Stan	8	0	Well, yeah, or we could just kill him.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Yeah, that'd be faster.	[]
Stan	4	0	He's right there.	[]
Other	24	0	I'm afraid I can't. I think I'm actually starting to feel what you humons call compassion. It is an amazing feeling!	[]
Other	1	0	Awww..!	[]
Mr. Garrison	62	0	Alright children, as you know, we've been waiting for the absent kid's ballot to come in. Well, his mother was nice enough to bring him in from the hospital so that he could cast his vote. Ms. Harris?  Thank you very much, Billy. Don't forget to pick up your lung.  Alright, the absent kid's ballot is for...  Filmore.	[]
Other	2	0	Yay./Hooray.	[]
Other	3	0	Wait one minute!	[]
Mr. Garrison	5	0	Oh, Jesus tap-dancing Christ.	[]
Other	16	0	I think the ballot were misleading. Some kids didn't understand whom they were voting for.	[]
Mr. Garrison	21	0	There's a box next to Filmore's name and a box next to Ike's! What's not to understand?	[]
Other	13	0	You're just saying that, 'cause you know you're gonna lose now.	[]
Other	10	0	No, I'm saying that because you are a boogerface!	[]
Other	14	0	Well, just you wait, 'cause my famous aunt is on huh way right now.	[]
Mr. Garrison	5	0	Who's your famous aunt?	[]
Other	6	0	My aunt Rosie, Rosie O'Donnell.	[]
Mr. Garrison	8	0	Your aunt Rosie O'Donnell is coming here?	[]
Other	15	0	Yeah, she's very active in politics. So she's gonna set all this straight.	[]
Mr. Garrison	2	0	Oh no..!	[]
Other	1	0	Recharging.	[]
Cartman	32	1	Sweet. You're so cool, Trapper Keeper. I would never let those assholes take you away. I don't wanna wait for my Trapper Keeper to be overThe ways of my Trap--	['assholes']
Cartman	2	0	Oh, cool.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Whoa...	[]
Other	19	0	And so you see, Ms. Cartman, you cannot buy your son Eric another Trapper Keeper. Not now! Not ever!	[]
Other	19	0	Right, because it will hybrid with all those other processors and generate a whole new era of technological darkness.	[]
Other	1	0	Correct.	[]
Other	10	0	Well, I certainly won't buy him anymore, then... Bill.	[]
Other	19	0	Good. Now all that is left to do is destroy the Trapper Keeper Eric has now. Where is he?	[]
Other	16	0	In his room. But, why don't I show you the rest of the house first?	[]
Stan	2	0	Uh-oh.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Here we go again.	[]
Other	4	0	Come this way, Billy.	[]
Stan	14	0	Well, come on. Let's go upstairs and get Cartman's Trapper Keeper ourselves.	[]
Cartman	20	1	Kyle is just jealous of you, Trapper Keeper. You kick ass!I don't wanna let my Trapper Keeper get--	['ass']
Stan	9	0	Open up, Cartman! We're taking your Trapper Keeper!	[]
Cartman	9	0	Screw you guys, screw you guysScrew you guys, scr--	[]
Other	5	0	Trapper Keeper, ready to ensorb.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Huh?	[]
Kyle	4	1	Dammit, Cartman, open up!	['dammit']
Other	5	0	Trapper Keeper, ready for hybrid.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Oh, sweet. What's it gonna hybrid with now?  Ugh--!	[]
Stan	26	1	Cartman, you might as well open up! We're just gonna have Bill Cosby bust the door down after he finishes having sex with your mom.	['sex']
Kyle	10	0	Cartman?  He's not gonna open it. Break it down.	[]
Stan	4	0	You break it down!	[]
Kyle	7	0	Okay. Ready? One, two, three, not it!	[]
Stan	5	0	Not it! You lose, Kenny.	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Awww..!)  (Argh--!)	[]
Stan	7	0	Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!	[]
Kyle	2	0	You ba--!	[]
Other	1	0	Agggghhh!	[]
Other	4	0	Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah!	[]
Mr. Garrison	35	1	What the hell is that?  Oh my God! What is that thing? Children, there's some huge bulbous monstrosity heading for the classroom!  Oh my God, it's awful! It's coming for the door.	['hell']
Other	2	0	Hello, kids!	[]
Other	2	0	Aunt Rosie!	[]
Mr. Garrison	12	0	Run for your lives, children!  I'll try to fight it off!	[]
Other	7	0	That's my aunt, Rosie O'Donnell.	[]
Mr. Garrison	13	0	Oh. Oh, um... Pleasure to meet you, Miss Donnell. You're looking... well.	[]
Other	13	0	Don't worry, kids. Everything's gonna be fine. What's the problem?	[]
Other	8	0	Aunt Rosie. We think I won class president.	[]
Other	3	0	No, Ike won.	[]
Mr. Garrison	22	0	Look, it's very simple. We took a vote and the vote tied, so now we gotta come up with a way--	[]
Other	31	0	Well it obviously isn't that simple, is it? I mean, you'd think a little kindergarten teacher could've handled this, but now we're gonna do it my way!	[]
Other	4	0	We are Trapper Keeper.	[]
Other	8	0	Oh no! It is heading for Cheyenne Mountain!	[]
Kyle	4	0	Why is that bad?	[]
Other	23	0	It was when the Trapper Keeper assimilated with the supercomputer at Cheyenne Mountain that it was able to fuse into all defensive computers!	[]
Stan	10	0	Then we have to stop it before it gets there!	[]
Kyle	5	0	Step on it, Bill Cosby!	[]
Other	3	0	Hey, Mark, look.	[]
Other	12	0	Wow. That is about the nicest Trapper Keeper I've ever seen.	[]
Stan	5	0	Cartman, you have to stop!	[]
Other	7	0	We are Trapper Keeper. We are one.	[]
Other	11	0	A part of your friend must still be alive in there.	[]
Stan	4	0	He is in there.	[]
Other	23	0	That must be what Trapper Keeper is using for ventilation. If one of you could get in there, you could reach the CPU.	[]
Stan	5	0	One-two-three, not it!	[]
Kyle	3	1	Not-- Aw, damnit..!	['damnit']
Cartman	5	0	What are you doing, Kyle?	[]
Kyle	19	0	I'm going to try and break you away from the computer, Cartman. I need to remove the CPU.	[]
Cartman	11	0	I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	4	2	Screw you, fat ass!	['fat', 'ass']
Cartman	3	0	Hey, screw you.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Cartman!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Agh--!	[]
Kyle	1	0	No!	[]
Other	30	0	Okay, so then what we're going to do is count everybody's vote by hand, and after that, we're gonna go over the votes again manually, and then--	[]
Mr. Garrison	35	0	Oh, stop it, stop it! Stop i-i-it!   Look kids, we're all in this kindergarten class together. We have to respect one another or else we're in for a terrible school year.	[]
Other	17	0	We're just making sure that the kids that voted for my nephew don't get cheated.	[]
Mr. Garrison	110	3	Half the kids in the class didn't vote for your nephew, so what about them? You don't give a crap about them because they're not on your side! People like you preach tolerance and open-mindedness all the time, but when it comes to Middle America, you think we're all evil and stupid country yokels who need your political enlightenment! Well, just because you're on TV doesn't mean you know crap about the government! Now get your ass back on first class and respect this class's right to make up their own minds!  ...Oh, sorry I got a little off the subject, kids.	['crap', 'crap', 'ass']
Other	37	0	How dare you?! I will not be preached at by a country pumpkin!  I'm leaving this podunk town, but in my place I'm gonna send more lawyers, statesmen and press than you have ever seen!	[]
Mr. Garrison	14	0	Oh no, children, I think I've just made this a whole lot worse.	[]
Other	1	0	Aaghh!	[]
Other	1	0	Wagghh!	[]
Other	16	0	Well that does it. I'm gonna have to report this.  Car one to base--  Aghh!	[]
Other	12	0	It is infusing with everything. It is already too powerful to stop!	[]
Stan	10	0	Kyle's got to succeed. He's just got to.	[]
Kyle	6	0	I can't reach the CPU.	[]
Other	9	0	What are you doin'?! Get out of my way!	[]
Other	9	0	Oh, no! Now there's two of those things!	[]
Stan	10	0	No, I think that other thing is Rosie O'Donnell.	[]
Other	12	0	Huh? Which one? I-It's just like I'm seeing double.	[]
Other	10	0	I said, get out of my way!  Aaaaggghhhh!!!  Ogh. Noo--	[]
Other	1	0	Eeww.	[]
Other	14	0	Look! I think that infusing with Rosie O'Donnell has made Trapper Keeper sick.	[]
Other	5	0	Oohh... Bad pie... Bad pie...	[]
Stan	8	0	This is your chance, Kyle! Cartman has weakened!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Got 'em!	[]
Stan	3	0	He did it!	[]
Mr. Garrison	30	0	Okay, children, the lawyers for Ike's side have agreed with the lawyers on Filmore's side to hold another meeting regarding Form 22F. Do we all have that form?	[]
Other	5	0	Is this the kindergarten classroom?	[]
Mr. Garrison	2	0	Jesse Jackson?	[]
Other	13	0	That's right! I believe the African-American in your class were misrepresented!	[]
