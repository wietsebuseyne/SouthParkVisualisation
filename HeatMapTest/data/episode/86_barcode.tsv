Kyle	2	0	No way.	[]

Cartman	41	0	Okay, Kyle, you're being a Negative Nancy. Stop it. Eh, unless you want everyone to call you Negative Nancy from now on.  Now, what we need is to all chip in four dollars, and we can have them here tomorrow!	[]
Kyle	14	0	Only sixteen dollars? They can't be cool if they're only sixteen dollars.	[]
Cartman	16	0	If Nancy doesn't want to chip in, then it will be $5.35 per person!	[]
Stan	5	0	Alright, I'll chip in.	[]

Butters	18	0	Excellent, General Disarray! Now we can begin my most horrible evil plan yet to wreak havoc on humanity.	[]

Butters	12	0	Simple, my dear general.  We are going to block out the sun!	[]
Other	1	0	Oh.	[]
Butters	39	0	Oh yes! I have plotted for weeks, and figured that if we build a huge ...wooden shade eighty feet high, a-and fifty feet wide , precisely on this hill, South Park ...will forever be cast in a great shadow.	[]
Other	2	0	Oh, awesome!	[]
Butters	24	0	Soon, all people will have to live like moles! They will love only to remember with sorrow how great the sun used to be!	[]
Other	9	0	Cool. It'll be just like on the Simpsons.	[]
Butters	1	0	Huh?	[]
Other	22	0	They did that on the Simpsons. I think it was the Mr. Burns character. He tried to block Springfield from the sun.	[]
Butters	10	0	He did? Hawww, heck. I thought I was bein' original.	[]
Other	6	0	So how do we build it?	[]
Butters	40	1	Aww, I don't wanna do it now , not if they already did it on the Simpsons.  I have to think of something else.  Uh Goddamnit, how come every time I think of something clever, the Simpsons already did it?	['goddamnit']
Cartman	9	0	Sea people... coming in the mail tomorrow...  Yesss... Yeesss...	[]
Cartman	72	1	Look at me, livin' free Free and clean amongst the Sea People ''We look for pirates and search for gold. Life is an adventure with the Sea People They don't ever complain, they don't call me fat. They don't make me do homework or nothin' like that. This is the way life was meant to be. Laughin' and singing, Sea people and me. Sea people and me, you guys.	['fat']
Cartman	24	2	Woowww. Only three more hours, sea people.  Only three hours and you can take me away from this crappy goddamned planet full of hippies.	['crappy', 'goddamned']
Cartman	88	0	Okay. I've added the water purifier tablet to the Sea People Kingdom tank. Now it says  Step 2.  Add the Sea People eggs to the water; you will see sea life spring instantly.  Okay, let's just run through this one more time: when the sea people arrive I will welcome them to South Park as Ambassador of Earth. Tweek, you give them the key to the city, and we'll all engage them in simple conversation. We've gotta make sea people feel comfortable, okay? Ready?	[]
Stan	5	0	Ready. Let's see 'em.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Hold the sign up, Kyle!  Higher, Kyle!  Okay.  Here we go.	[]

Cartman	4	0	I got RIPPED OFF!	[]
Kyle	4	0	I told you, Cartman.	[]
Cartman	77	2	Oh, shut up, Kyle!!! Shut your Goddamned Jew mouth!!! You people are why there's war in the Middle East!!!  And you, Tweek!! Why don't you learn to button your shirt right, for once?! You're as bad as Stan with his stupid girlfriend, always spending time with her!! God, I hate you guys!!  They were supposed to take me away to their underwater kingdom. They were supposed to take me on adventures of the deep	['goddamned', 'jew']
Other	14	0	They package brine shrimp and sell them to kids? That's not right, man!	[]
Stan	7	0	What are we gonna do with them?	[]
Cartman	5	0	Who cares?! Throw 'em away!!	[]
Kyle	12	0	Hey! Let's pour them in the teacher's coffee tomorrow morning.	[]
Stan	5	0	Yeah, that'd be funny.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Heheh, okay, okay.	[]
Cartman	12	0	Alright, listen to me! We must take a strict vow of silence!	[]
Other	5	0	Jesus Christ, we killed her!	[]

Butters	6	0	General Disarray, are your parents home?	[]
Other	1	0	No.	[]
Butters	16	0	Ah, I've done it, General Disarray. I've completed my most horrible deed to date.	[]
Other	1	0	What?	[]
Butters	31	0	You know that big statue in the town square of pioneer John Wesley Powell? I snuck over there with a hacksaw and uh, and I cut off his head!  Hahahahaa, yeah!	[]
Other	2	0	Oh, uh...	[]
Butters	16	0	Hahaha, and they're probably just realizing that now! Quick! We must turn on the news!	[]
Other	34	1	... but Hillary Clinton's ass just keeps getting bigger.  Also in the news tonight, a vandal has apparently cut off and stolen the head of the Powell statue in the South Park Town Square.	['ass']
Butters	12	0	Look! Look! I've made the news! I-I've wreaked havoc!	[]
Other	15	0	The head was taken in the early morning hours and the police have no leads.	[]
Butters	13	0	I finally made the world sorry! I've brought sadness, a-and chaos!	[]
Other	34	0	This act, of course, reminded us all of the time that Bart Simpson  took the head of the Springfield statue in one of their classic episodes. Here's what some people had to say:	[]
Other	23	0	Well, I, I think whoever took the head was... really just doing an homage to the Simpsons.  Heh, I think it's great.	[]
Other	11	0	Yes, it really made me reflect on that episode and laugh.	[]
Other	18	0	Well the Simpsons is such a great show, and we need reminders like this to keep us watching.	[]
Butters	7	1	Oh. Uh-m, son of a bitch.	['bitch']
Other	25	0	The police say that instead of looking for the missing head, they'd rather leave it off and be reminded of the Simpsons every day.	[]
Butters	12	0	Well why didn't you tell me the Simpsons already did that?	[]
Other	11	1	You seemed so proud, I didn't wanna bum you out.	['bum']
Butters	2	0	Stupid Simpsons...	[]
Other	7	0	Hello there, Phillip. I brought you something	[]
Other	4	0	Oh, what is it?	[]
Kyle	11	0	See? We're just watching cartoons, like always. Nothing's changed.	[]
Other	5	0	Jesus Christ, she's dead!!	[]
Stan	9	0	Stop it, Tweek! We're pretending like nothing happened.	[]
Other	10	0	Phillip, I think I may have accidentally killed Celine Dion.	[]
Other	7	1	Killing is never an accident, you dickface!	['dickface']
Stan	5	0	Oh jeez, change the channel.	[]
Other	31	0	And in other news, still no known cause of death found for elementary school teacher Diane Choksondik. However, doctors say that during the autopsy they did find semen in her stomach.	[]
Stan	18	0	They found the sea men! It's only a matter of tiime before they find the women, too!	[]
Other	13	0	The autopsy is ongoing and cause of death is yet to be determined.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Oh God!	[]
Stan	3	0	We're dead!	[]
Other	15	0	Oh Jesus!  That's it, man! I want nothing more to do with you guys!	[]
Cartman	5	0	Tweek! Where are you going?	[]
Other	25	0	They're gonna find you out! Then when they do I don't wanna be within fifty feet of you! You're gonna fry, man!	[]
Stan	12	0	Hey, Tweek, you're in this just as much as we are!	[]
Other	22	0	What?! I told you NOT to put the sea people in her coffee! I wasn't even there when you did it!	[]
Kyle	14	0	Yeah, but you're our new friend and that makes you cul.. p-piable!	[]
Cartman	19	0	In fact, that makes you the most responsible. Tweek, you might have to take the fall on this one.	[]
Other	3	0	Rrrr-hr-hrrr!!!	[]
Chef	5	0	Oh, welll, hello there, children.	[]
Stan	7	0	Chef, we did something kind of bad.	[]
Kyle	9	0	We don't know who else to talk to.	[]
Chef	33	0	Ohh, I'm sure your little cracker problems ain't all that bad. Come on in.  Now, just sit down and take a deep breath and tell ol' Chef what's goin' on.	[]
Stan	9	0	We need you to promise not to tell anybody.	[]
Chef	11	0	Nowww, children, every problem can be worked out. What was it?	[]
Stan	12	0	We... killed our teacher and they found our seamen in her stomach	[]
Chef	48	0	...Oh, children, that's a problem we all have to face at one time or another. Here: let me sing you a little song that might cheer you up. Sometimes you kill your teacher and they find your semen in her stomach, and uh Wait! What the what?!	[]
Stan	5	0	So what should we do?	[]
Kyle	9	0	Wow, I guess this really is a big deal.	[]
Cartman	29	0	We've only got one option, you guys. We're gonna have to go to that hospital where they're doing the autopsy and get our seamen back ourselves.	[]
Other	6	0	Gnaaahahahah!  I pulled out my hair!	[]
Butters	34	0	Wokay, how about this, Dougie?  I-I'm going' to pose as a real-estate agent and con everyone in town into buyin' a monorail. And then skip town with all their money.  No?	[]
Other	9	0	...Simpsons did it. The did it in episode 204.	[]
Butters	26	0	Wokay , then I'm goin' to start a Web site to spread vicious ru-rumrs about everyone in town! And and then I'll take their-	[]
Other	3	0	Simpsons did it!	[]
Butters	19	0	I'll bury a skeleton wearing angel wings so that the townspeople will think a fallen angel has fallen-	[]
Other	3	0	Simpsons did it!	[]
Stan	3	0	This is it.	[]
Cartman	28	0	Alright, everyone scatter and look for the seamen. Tweek, stay by the door and keep a look out. If you see anybody coming, say the code word: Hammertime.	[]
Other	14	0	Hammertime? Can't the code word just be... lookout? I won't remember Hammertime!	[]
Cartman	16	0	Ugh.  Just remember the song Can't Touch This and you'll remember the code word!	[]
Stan	2	0	Yeah, stupid.	[]
Other	2	0	Oh, God.	[]
Kyle	4	0	There's nothing here!	[]
Stan	7	0	Dude, it's probably in her stomach.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Is it her?	[]
Kyle	6	0	Yeah, it's Ms. Choksondik alright.	[]
Stan	5	0	What do we do now?	[]
Cartman	20	0	Just reach in there and get the seamen out of her stomach!  Oh, God! You guys are such pussies!  Hemmm...	[]
Other	15	0	Erm! Hff. You gu-guys! Ha... Hamme-  I can't remember uh-the code word!	[]
Stan	6	0	Do you see the sea people.	[]
Cartman	6	0	No, just a bunch of goo.	[]
Other	19	0	You guys! Um, dum dumdumdum, dumdum, dumdum. Can't touch this. Dum dumdumdum, dumdum, dumdum. Can't touch this.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Ms. Choksondik stinks inside.	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Other	12	0	...dumdum, dumdum. Can't touch this. Dum dumdumdum, dumdum, then stop. HAMMERTIME!	[]
Stan	1	0	Aaah!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Quick. Hide.	[]
Other	9	0	Yeah, well, at least we got Shannon Sharp back.	[]
Other	20	0	Alright, let's just leave the semen sample next to the corpse; I wanna run a hair fiber test next.	[]
Other	5	0	Hey, do you smell children?	[]
Other	4	0	No, that's not...	[]
Kyle	2	0	Got it!	[]
Stan	3	0	Let's go!	[]
Butters	16	0	Bring the World Cup to South Park so the... a huge soccer riot can destroy the-	[]
Other	6	0	Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it!	[]
Butters	23	0	Take all the beer cans in South Park and have them shaken up in a huge mixer at the paint store so that-	[]
Other	9	0	Episode 9F17 entitled So It's Come To This!	[]
Butters	19	0	Fine! Then maybe I'll just forget about destroying the town and just run away and join the circus!	[]
Other	3	0	...Simpsons did it.	[]
Butters	1	0	Dwaah!!	[]
Cartman	27	0	There. We just put the sea people back in the tank with the others, and nobody will ever know.  The blood is washed neatly from our hands.	[]
Chef	37	0	Alright, children, I got you four tickets to Thailand  and three hundred dollars cash . It's gonna be tough living for a while. You might have to do things for money you never thought of doin' before.	[]
Cartman	23	0	It's alright, Chef! We got our sea people out of the teacher's stomach and we put them back in their aquarium!	[]
Chef	4	0	...Wait, what? Sea people?	[]
Stan	11	0	The sea people that we put in the teacher's coffee.	[]
Chef	9	0	Uhh, maybe you'd better start from the beginning.	[]
Stan	9	0	...and then we put them back in the tank.	[]
Chef	11	0	Oohhh, children, you misunderstood. Sea people is different from se-men.	[]
Kyle	2	0	It is?	[]
Chef	30	0	Yes! That stuff that was in that vial didn't come from you, it came from someone else.  I thought you children took turns rapin' and then murdered the teacher.	[]
Cartman	20	0	Well if they found somebody else's sea men in her stomach, maybe they'll find our sea people, too.	[]
Chef	19	0	Relax, children, junk that's in brine can't kill you. Your teacher must have died from something else.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Oh, really??	[]
Other	8	0	Egh! I'm so relieved. Gaah-ah-ah!	[]
Chef	42	0	Alright. You children have had a long night. Why don't we all get some rest and on Monday, I'll sing you a song explainin' the difference between semen and sea people.  Come on, children. I'll walk you all home.	[]
Stan	3	0	Okay. Goodnight, Cartman.	[]
Cartman	3	0	G'night, guys.	[]
Kyle	8	0	I'm so glad we're not murderers.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Ah, so great that everything is finally back to normal.	[]
Cartman	10	0	H'you guys! Come quick!  You won't believe it!	[]
Stan	4	0	Oh no, what now?	[]
Cartman	25	0	Those sea men from the teacher's stomach somehow combined with the remaining sea people we had left in the tank and, ah, well LOOK!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Whoa.	[]
Stan	5	0	Wow. How did that happen?	[]
Cartman	29	0	I've been up for hours doing some calculations, and I've come up with my final theory of composite dynamics.  Sea people plus sea men equals sea ciety.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Whoa.	[]
Stan	6	0	They've already accomplished so much.	[]
Other	18	0	They're like, bacteria. Small organisms live much faster lives and do things at a much faster rate.	[]
Cartman	30	0	That's right, Tweek. And if my theory is correct, all we need to get is more of the two reacting agents, and we can really see them flourish. Tweek!	[]
Other	1	0	Hr!	[]
Cartman	36	0	You go and send away for more sea people from the magazine ad! Get at least five gallons of them here stat! Stan and Kyle, you go find a bigger fish tank to them all in.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Well what are you gonna do?	[]
Cartman	16	0	Me?  I'm gonna go out on the town and find ten gallons of sea men.	[]
Butters	98	0	I've done it, General Disarray. I've watches all one hundred and thirty-two episodes of the Simpsons, twice. And I've finally come up with something... tha they have never done! Uh, behold!  This device that I have made will take the cherries out of chocolate-covered cherries and replace the inside instead, with two-month-old mayonnaise.  People will think that they are gonna get a bite of a sweet, delicious cherry, but, instead, they'll get a mouth full of yuckies, and sticky mayonnaise. Hey!  You've never ...seen this on the Simpsons, right?	[]
Other	11	0	No, I think the Simpsons would be more clever than that.	[]
Butters	18	0	Good! Then l-let us take my machine outside and make society finally pay for sh-shunning us!	[]
Other	27	0	Tonight on the Simpsons: It's a laughorama when Bart builds a machine that takes cherries out of chocolate-covered cherries and replace them instead, with mayonnaise.	[]
Butters	8	0	Nnno , uh no, no, it can't be.	[]
Other	8	0	Uh oh, Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it!	[]
Butters	2	0	No! No!	[]
Other	6	0	Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it!	[]
Butters	1	0	Aaaaah!	[]
Other	6	0	Don't have a cow, man.	[]
Butters	3	0	Oh sweet Jesus!	[]
Other	4	0	Can I help you?	[]
Cartman	14	0	Yes, my mommy told me this is where I could find some sea men?	[]
Other	4	0	Your... mom told you?	[]
Cartman	6	0	Do you have them or not?	[]
Other	9	0	We... sell semen, yes, but not normally to children.	[]
Cartman	4	0	What's your name?	[]
Other	2	0	Frances Velman.	[]
Cartman	103	2	Frances, let's talk. I don't want a bunch of bullcrap from you and you don't a bunch of bullcrap from me, right? Where does that get us? Nowhere. The truth is, I'm completely certified to handle sea men, and though I may appear young, I'm one of the leading sea men authorities of the Midwest. Up and comer, you know what I'm saying? I'll have my own business soon and I'll need people to run it. I'm talkin' about you, Frances. And I'm talkin' about a six-figure income. How does that sound?	['bullcrap', 'bullcrap']
Other	14	0	Everything we supply here is by a quarter-ounce.  One donor, certified, on record.	[]
Cartman	4	0	I see, very interesting.	[]
Other	4	0	What are you doing?	[]
Cartman	30	0	Takin' a look here.  Seems like quality stuff you got here, Frances. Yeah, good texture, nice consistency. Sea men must be alive and healthy in there. I'll take five.	[]
Other	2	0	Five? Vials?	[]
Cartman	2	0	No, gallons.	[]
Other	8	0	Www-we don't have that much here.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Damint! Give me all you've got, then!	[]
Butters	6	0	Aaah! Ah, Ah, Aaah! Nooo! Nooo!	[]
Other	6	0	Simpsons did it!! Simpsons did it!!	[]
Butters	9	0	Waaaah!  Hay! Uh let me on! Let me on!	[]
Other	5	0	SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP!!!	[]
Butters	1	0	Haaah!	[]
Mr. Garrison	6	0	Butters, have you seen Mr. Hat?	[]
Chef	3	0	Hello there, children!	[]
Butters	2	0	Aaah! Nooo!	[]
Mr. Garrison	7	1	...What the hell's wrong with him?	['hell']
Stan	11	0	Look, the sea people have evolved to an Egyptian-like culture.	[]
Other	8	1	Soon they'll discover frozen food. Goh-ho.	['ho']
Cartman	14	0	That should be enough water, Kyle. You got the new sea-people packets, Tweek?	[]
Other	3	0	Uh-uh huh.	[]
Stan	4	0	Well, drop them in!	[]
Cartman	7	0	And I've got the sea men.	[]
Kyle	13	0	Wow. That's a lot of sea men you've got there, Cartman.	[]
Cartman	23	0	Yeah, I bought all that I could at this bank, and then I got the rest from this guy Ralph in an alley.	[]
Stan	3	0	That's cool.	[]
Cartman	35	1	Yeah, and the sweet thing is, this stupid asshole didn't even charge me money for it. He just made me close my eyes and suck it out of a hose. Heh.  There we go.	['asshole']
Stan	12	0	Okay, now let's put the sea ciety in its new home.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Nothin' to do now but wait.	[]
Stan	10	0	...Close your eyes and suck it out of a hose?	[]
Cartman	9	0	Uh-huh, suck it out of a hose, yeah.	[]
Stan	1	0	Hm.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Huh.	[]
Cartman	66	0	Oh my God! The tiny underwater civilization has advanced hundreds of years.  Look! There's a library! A-and a temple! And a- who-?  Oh. They think I'm God.  Yes!!! I am god of the sea people!!! You hear that?!  I am god of the sea people!!! I am master of their great sunken empire!!!  Mo-o-om! I'm god of the sea people!	[]
Other	4	0	That's nice, poopie.	[]
Other	47	0	And in other South Park News, elementary school teacher Ms. Choksondik's  autopsy has shown that the semen in her stomach belongs to school counselor, Mr. Mackey.  However, the semen apparently did NOT contribute to the death, and so Mr. Mackey's identity is to remain anonymous.	[]
Other	2	0	Hey Butters.	[]
Butters	1	0	Haaa!	[]
Stan	20	0	Hey, what are you doing, man? Cartman says he has something really cool to show everybody. You've gotta come.	[]
Butters	1	0	Cartman?	[]
Cartman	2	0	Ha ha!	[]
Cartman	16	0	Behold! You all see my tiny minions groveling at my likeness! I am Eric Cartman, god.	[]
Kyle	17	0	Hey. We paid for the sea people too. How come they're not making statues of us?	[]
Cartman	12	1	Be you not jealous, Jew. I am creator of all things, yea.	['jew']
Mr. Garrison	15	0	That is very impressive, Eric. What do you intend to do with your underwater society?	[]
Cartman	32	0	I'm gonna send a message to my people and tell 'em to develop a great machine that will shrink me down to their size, so I can live amongst them forever.	[]
Butters	3	0	Aha! Ahaha! Ahahahaha!	[]
Cartman	8	1	What the hell is wrong with you, Butters?	['hell']
Butters	45	0	They did that on the Simpsons! Ha! Treehouse of Horror! Episode 4F02! The Genesis tub. Lisa loses a tooth, and the bacteria on it start to grow, and makes a little society, and they build a statue of her thinking she's God! Ha! Hahaha!	[]
Cartman	1	0	...So?	[]
Kyle	2	0	...Yeah. So?	[]
Cartman	9	0	Dude, the Simpsons have done everything already. Who cares?	[]
Stan	18	0	Yeah, and they've been on the air for like, thirteen years. Of course they've done everything.	[]
Mr. Garrison	10	0	Every idea's been done, Butters, even before the Simpsons.	[]
Chef	14	0	Yeah. In fact, that episode was a rip-off of a Twilight Zone episode.	[]
Butters	45	0	Really? So I shouldn't care if I come up with an idea, and the Simpsons already did it. It... uh...doesn't... matter.  Everything is back to normal, a, I think... I think I can go back to tryin' to destroy the world again.	[]
Chef	3	0	Good for you!	[]
Cartman	13	1	Yeah, that's great Butters. Now get the hell out of my room.	['hell']
Butters	14	0	I feel like a spring chicken. I'm ready to wreak havoc once again!	[]
Stan	13	0	Hey, look everybody! The other side of the aquarium is building another statue!	[]
Kyle	4	0	Hey! It's Tweek.	[]
Other	16	0	Me?? Aw, man! I don't wanna be a god. That is waaay too much pressure.	[]
Cartman	11	1	That is bullcrap! You'd better stop worshiping him, sea people!	['bullcrap']
Mr. Garrison	5	0	What's going on now?	[]
Kyle	16	0	The sea people from Cartman's side are suicide-bombing the buildings on Tweek's side.	[]
Other	2	0	Gaaa-hah!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Yeah! Go!	[]
