Cartman	22	1	So then, the guy hits the ping-pong ball with his dick, and it goes right in the other guy's mouth.	['dick']
Butters	8	0	Hey Stan, I have a note for you.	[]
Stan	2	0	A note?	[]
Butters	13	0	Yeah, uh, Wendy said to give you this.  I'm like a mailman.	[]
Kyle	4	0	What's it say?	[]
Stan	4	0	We need to talk.	[]
Cartman	21	1	Ohhhhhhhh. When a chick says We need to talk you might as well just start punching yourself in the balls, dude.	['balls']
Other	8	0	Are you sure he has a problem, Wendy?	[]
Wendy	44	0	Yes. I've read all about it. It's a real disease. It's called hoarding. People who can't throw anything away, and they just keep living in deeper and deeper filth until the people around them just can't take it anymore.	[]
Stan	4	0	Is something wrong, Wendy?	[]
Wendy	8	0	Stan? We need to talk about your locker.	[]
Stan	2	0	My locker?	[]
Wendy	28	0	Every time I see the condition it's in I j-I just wanna cry. It just keeps getting messier and messier. I think you have a problem.	[]
Stan	3	0	Are you serious?	[]
Wendy	25	0	It's so full of junk it takes you forever to find anything. And lately you've been asking to keep things in my locker.	[]
Stan	7	0	Well it's just a little messy.	[]
Wendy	25	0	No, Stan, it's called hoarding! And if you don't get help I don't know how much longer I could be with you!	[]
Stan	3	0	Aw come on.	[]
Wendy	10	0	Then can we throw some stuff in your locker away?	[]
Stan	2	0	Yeah, alright.	[]
Wendy	22	0	Okay.  I've hired some experts to help you with this. We'll make this as easy as possible on you, Stan.	[]
Other	34	0	Hello everyone, my name is Dr. Chinstrap. I'm a hoarding specialist, and today we're gonna help Stan clean out his locker. Alright, let's go ahead and see inside your locker, Stan.	[]
Stan	8	0	What, come on, it's not that bad.	[]
Other	39	0	Now, as part of Stan's therapy, we need to make sure we don't throw away anything he doesn't want us to. Stan needs to feel like he is in control or his psychosis will come out.	[]
Stan	17	0	My psychosis? Look, it isn't that big a deal, I'll just throw this stuff away.	[]
Other	8	0	Okay, great. How about we start with this?	[]
Stan	12	0	Well, no, that's my pencil box. I need my pencil box.	[]
Other	17	0	Okay, okay, we'll put that right here on the floor. Now how about this?  Broken toothbrush.	[]
Stan	17	0	Well... it's good to have that, because sometimes I really wanna brush after lunch, and I-	[]
Other	4	0	But it's broken.	[]
Stan	8	0	Yeah, but it works perfectly fine and I-	[]
Other	24	0	Okay, okay. Broken toothbrush is going right here, by the pencil box.  Now how about this?  Old sandwich in a baggie filled with maggots.	[]
Other	1	0	Eeeeewwww!	[]
Stan	18	0	Well, that, I mean, yeah, I mean... I kinda need that. Let's, let's just keep that.	[]
Other	11	0	It's full of maggots, Stan. Can we throw it away?	[]
Stan	13	0	Well, I might need it if I every have to, you know, like-	[]
Other	17	0	The maggots are crawling down my hand and biting my wrist, Stan. Can we throw this away?	[]
Stan	21	0	Well, I- I guess so, but-  Whoa-whoa-wait, this is all happening a little fast. Can we just slow down?	[]
Other	7	0	Now how about this empty aspirin bottle?	[]
Stan	7	0	Well no, don't throw that out.	[]
Other	9	0	Can we throw out these wadded up papers, then?	[]
Stan	29	0	No, because there could be something written on one of them that's important and uh-! No, don't take my empty bottle-!  G-give me back my sandwich!	[]
Kyle	6	0	Dude. What's wrong with you?	[]
Stan	7	0	I don't... I don't know.	[]
Kyle	8	0	Maybe you should go talk to the counselor.	[]
Mr. Mackey	23	0	Stan, as your counselor, I'm here to help you with whatever problems you might have, m'kay? Now, what is the matter?	[]
Stan	12	0	Well, my friends are worried that I'm showing signs of... hoarding.	[]
Mr. Mackey	6	0	Hoarding? M'kay, what's that?	[]
Stan	22	0	Well, apparently, it's when you... don't throw anything away and soon you find yourself, living with a, bunch of... junk?	[]
Mr. Mackey	15	0	Hmmm, I haven't heard of that, but it- it definitely sounds bad, m'kay?	[]
Stan	10	0	Mr. Mackey, is there, maybe anything you wanna talk about?	[]
Mr. Mackey	4	0	Me? ...Like, like what?	[]
Stan	17	0	Well like, you've got an old milk carton here from a month ago that's like-	[]
Mr. Mackey	36	3	DON'T YOU TOUCH THAT! THAT'S NOT SOMETHING TO THROW AWAY! IF YOU THROW THAT AWAY I WILL RAPE YOU IN THE MOUTH! M'KAY?! I WILL RAPE YOU IN YOUR FUCKIN' MOUTH! M'KAY?!	['rape', 'rape', 'fuckin']
Other	29	0	There's no doubt about it. The school counselor here is a Class-5 hoarder. As for your son, Mr. and Mrs. Marsh, he's easily a Class-3.	[]
Other	8	0	But why is Mr. Mackey doing this now?	[]
Other	8	0	Yeah, our son has always been fairly clean.	[]
Other	41	0	We don't know a lot about what causes hoarding, but we do know it often relates to some kind of psychological trauma. If it's okay with you, we'd like to run some tests on the both of them.	[]
Other	11	0	Is that really necessary for Stan? It's just his locker.	[]
Other	30	0	I don't know if you realize how serious locker hoarding is.  It can lead to room hoarding, then house hoarding. In some cases, people even hoard animals, like cats.	[]
Randy	23	0	Oh yeah. Like that weird guy over on on Burgess Road. That guy, Mr. Yelman. He's been hoarding animals for years now.	[]
Other	3	0	Oh no, really?	[]
Other	13	0	Mr. Yelman, we received some disturbing reports that you might be hoarding sheep.	[]
Other	6	0	...Well I, that is I, I-	[]
Other	16	0	It's okay, Mr. Yelman, I'm a hoarding specialist. What you have is an illness.	[]
Other	20	0	Don't worry, Mr. and Mrs. Marsh. Dr. Chinstrap is a professional at memory regression. This should prove very helpful.	[]
Other	39	0	Alright everyone, we are all here to face the disease of hoarding together. Nothing to be ashamed of, everyone here has the same problem. Whether it's office hoarding or in the locker, or even the hoarding of animals.	[]
Other	9	0	Excuse me, but uh, I am a sheep herder.	[]
Other	8	0	It's pronounced hoarder, and yes you are.	[]
Other	9	0	But but I, uh I'm actually herding sheep.	[]
Other	17	0	Yes, you are herding sheep by hoarding them, aren't you? It's good you realize that.	[]
Other	6	0	No, but I just thought that-	[]
Other	41	0	Now listen: there's a psychological reason you're all doing this, and we're gonna get to the bottom of it. We're gonna do some regression therapy. I'll be taking you deep into your memories, into your past.	[]
Mr. Mackey	11	0	M'kay, that that sounds like it could be bad, uhkay?	[]
Other	37	0	Trust me, I know what I'm doing. I want the three of you to relax, and think about... a cloud. A lone cloud... floating... changing... Light... cool air... blowing on the cloud. Float-  WAAH! HAAA! HAAA!	[]
Mr. Mackey	4	0	What?! What?! Jesus, what?!	[]
Other	3	0	Oh my God!	[]
Other	32	0	Sorry, I just got a weird gas bubble for a second.  Anyway, A lone cloud... floating... wisps of cool air... Now the cloud is near you. You... you reach out to it.	[]
Mr. Mackey	1	0	Okay...	[]
Other	25	0	It's the cloud of your memories, of your past.  Your childhood perhaps. What do you see in the cloud? Who is in the cloud?	[]
Mr. Mackey	3	0	Billy. Billy Thompson?	[]
Other	5	0	There he is! Hey, Mackey!	[]
Other	10	0	Oh uh, hi Billy. Nice to see ya, m'kay?	[]
Other	2	0	Come 'ere!	[]
Other	12	0	Uh well, actually I need to get home, m'kay? I uh...	[]
Other	9	0	You snitched and told the principal I was smoking.	[]
Other	9	0	Oh well uh, uh... smoking's bad, uhkay?  Huhhhhh!	[]
Other	11	0	You're gonna die Mackey!  Hold his legs!  Come back here!	[]
Other	17	0	Okay. Okay, okay okay, it's okay. It's okay. Calm down, okay. Turn on the light.	[]
Stan	8	0	What? Whoa wait, what am I doing here?	[]
Other	3	0	Shh. Be quiet.	[]
Other	5	0	'Scuse me, where are we?	[]
Other	11	0	Shh. You've goota be quiet. Billy Thompson's out there.	[]
Stan	6	1	What the hell's going on?!	['hell']
Other	6	1	What the hell is going on?!	['hell']
Other	17	0	The counselor's flat top readers are calculating with the boy's and the sheep hoarder's.	[]
Other	2	0	Oh Jesus.	[]
Randy	4	0	What does that mean?	[]
Other	20	0	It means Mr. Mackey's childhood regression dream is... so vivid it actually sucked the other two patients into it.	[]
Randy	1	0	What?!	[]
Other	12	0	I'm afraid your son has gone into his counselor's dream.	[]
Randy	14	0	Aw come on, that's stupid. How's that, how's that even possible?	[]
Other	17	0	It's not stupid at all! Pinkerton, you explain the logic and I'll provide the background.	[]
Other	74	0	Alright.  Look, it is possible to enter into someone else's dreams.  Send dream trackers to go into a person's subconscious, like a spy seeing their dreams as they see them. Perhaps even planting ideas. If one person is regressing deeply enough, the dream can actually envelop those dreaming around the first person I talked about who's dreaming! And then, everyone in the dream would be in danger of never coming back.	[]
Other	11	0	Yay, my bedroom! Yep, this is my happy place, m'kay?	[]
Stan	2	0	Mr. Mackey.	[]
Other	16	0	Lite Brite, making things with light. What a sight, making things with Lite Brite, m'kay.	[]
Stan	6	0	Mr. Mackey, what are you doing?	[]
Other	22	0	Well this is a Lite Brite, m'kay. I can make things with light, like um, birds, m'kay, clowns, m'kay.	[]
Stan	8	0	Come on, dude, you've gotta wake up!	[]
Other	33	0	Oh yeah, my Evel Knievel doll!  I can take the motorcycle, hm'kay, I put it on this thing, like this.  Okay now crank it back, and now I let go.  Okay. Okay.	[]
Stan	17	0	Mr. Mackey, I realize this might be fun for you, but it totally isn't for me.	[]
Other	8	0	Hey, look what's on! It's ZOOM!	[]
Other	11	0	Excuse me, I really need to get back to my sheep.	[]
Stan	5	0	I'm working on it!	[]
Other	18	0	Write Zoom Z Double O M Box 350 Bos-ton Mass. Oooh two ooone three fouuur, m'kay!	[]
Stan	14	0	Dude, please wake up! You're a grown man in a psychiatrist's office!	[]
Other	29	0	You can hide in your house for now, Mackey, but tomorrow is a field trip! Frisco Woods! And I'm gonna do things to you you'll never forget!	[]
Other	14	0	No, uh Billy, please, ukay? I'm really sorry about the smoking thing, uh.	[]
Other	8	0	See you in the woods tomorrow, dead man!	[]
Other	2	0	Oh Jesus...	[]
Stan	15	0	Is that why we're here? Did something really bad happen on the field trip?	[]
Other	9	0	Yeah, it's probably gonna be bad, m'kay.	[]
Stan	1	0	Ohhhhhhh.	[]
Mr. Mackey	3	0	Ohhhhhhh, m'kay.	[]
Randy	26	0	What kind of hoarding specialist are you?! You trapped our son in his counselor's subconscious, and now you're saying he could die in there?!	[]
Other	12	0	Believe me, this is the last thing I wanted to have happen.	[]
Randy	3	0	That does it!	[]
Other	4	0	What are you doing?!	[]
Randy	17	0	I'm goin' in!  If they're locked into his regression, then maybe I can be too!	[]
Other	10	0	Are you crazy?! Mackey is in a very unstable state!	[]
Randy	10	1	Damn your incongruities!  I'm goin' in after my son!	['damn']
Other	16	0	It's a dream world where Mackey can imagine himself to be anything. It's dangerous!	[]
Randy	6	0	I said get me in there!	[]
Other	26	1	Alright, you wanna risk your ass?! Fine!  You see a cloud, it's a fluffy cloud, floating, happy, happy fluffy cloud. You reach out to it.	['ass']
Randy	1	0	Ahhh.	[]
Other	6	0	Alright kids, everyone on the bus.	[]
Stan	8	1	Wait wait, where the hell are we now?	['hell']
Other	9	0	It's the day of the big field trip.	[]
Other	8	0	Come on, Mackey. We're waitin' for ya.	[]
Other	2	0	Oh Jesus.	[]
Stan	20	0	Mr. Mackey, you have to wake up! I don't belong here! I need to have my own regression therapy!	[]
Other	9	0	Everyone on the bus now! We're runnin' late!	[]
Other	8	0	Excuse me, I'm actually a sheep herder.	[]
Other	19	0	It's pronounced hoarder, young man, and if you are you should talk to the school counselor about it!	[]
Other	8	0	Yes, but I, I'm so- wah- um.	[]
Stan	11	0	Please, I don't wanna go on your field trip, Mackey.	[]
Randy	2	0	Stan?  Stan!	[]
Stan	4	0	Dad? Is that you?	[]
Randy	5	0	Yes, it's me, Stan.	[]
Stan	3	0	Where are you?	[]
Randy	9	0	It's me! Up here!  I'm a butterfly!	[]
Stan	6	1	The hell are you doing, dad?	['hell']
Randy	9	0	I'm flying free with my beautiful butterfly wings!	[]
Stan	7	0	Did you come here to help me?	[]
Randy	8	0	I was gonna, but oh! This is fun!	[]
Stan	11	0	Dad, you gotta stop Mackey and bring us back to reality!	[]
Randy	17	0	Butterflies have no concern for such things, Stan. I'm gonna go find me some butterly poon.	[]
Stan	1	0	DAD!	[]
Randy	4	0	Aah ahhh aha ahhh.	[]
Stan	1	0	Aaaaaagh!	[]
Other	5	0	Uh oh, something's wrong.	[]
Other	3	0	What is it?!	[]
Other	8	0	The father. He's gone completely off chart.	[]
Other	6	0	Off chart? What does that mean?	[]
Other	5	0	We don't even know.	[]
Other	22	0	I told him not to go into the dream after his son. He should have waited for the experts to get here.	[]
Other	4	0	Who are the experts?	[]
Other	7	0	Get that door closed! Keep me covered!	[]
Other	5	0	Ah good, you're here.	[]
Other	4	0	What's the sitch?!	[]
Other	12	0	Four people, in there, all stuck in the middle one's dream.	[]
Other	16	0	We need to move them all to the next dream level before the projections kill them!	[]
Other	4	0	What next dream level?	[]
Other	30	0	Alright look. Right now they're all trapped in a dream.  We need to go in and put them under so they can go into a dream within a dream.	[]
Other	1	0	Why?	[]
Other	15	0	Because in the dream within a dream we can protect them from getting to limbo.	[]
Other	3	0	What's that?	[]
Other	3	0	Empty scary dreamspace.	[]
Other	4	0	So like a nightmare?	[]
Other	7	0	No, like a nightmare within a nightmare!	[]
Other	8	0	Why can't you wake up from that?	[]
Other	15	0	You can, but someone inside the dream has to kick you awake from the nightmare!	[]
Other	6	0	That doesn't sound very difficult.	[]
Other	2	0	It is!	[]
Other	1	0	Why?	[]
Other	1	0	Arrgh.	[]
Other	7	0	We don't have time for this!	[]
Other	19	0	Uh okay, fine. So you're gonna take my son to a dream within a dream, and then what?	[]
Other	8	0	Then we go into your husband's dream!	[]
Other	1	0	Okaaay...	[]
Other	11	0	But your husband will think we're in Hasselback's dream.	[]
Other	5	0	Okay, wait. Who's Hasselback?	[]
Other	2	0	I am.	[]
Other	10	0	Okay. Wait, no. Why do we need a football player?	[]
Other	10	0	Sometimes, thoughts of my dead wife manifest themselves as trains!	[]
Other	21	0	Are you all saying that you can go into a dream and take people in that dream into their own dream?	[]
Other	12	0	Not all the time, just this once. And maybe one other time.	[]
Other	6	0	It's so complex and cool.	[]
Other	25	0	Just because an idea is overly convoluted and complex doesn't make it cool! Going to multiple dream levels sounds like a really stupid idea!	[]
Other	15	0	You just don't get it 'cause you're not smart enough. Let's move!	[]
Other	8	0	Will they be able to wake Mackey up?	[]
Other	15	0	If they don't, it'll be the end of Europe as we know it.	[]
Other	1	0	Why?	[]
Other	1	0	Because.	[]
Other	7	0	Hello kids, my name is Ranger Pete.	[]
Other	3	0	Hi Ranger Pete.	[]
Other	5	0	Hi Ranger Pete, m'kay.	[]
Other	15	0	Today we're gonna be learning all about these amazing evergreens and this fragile ecosystem.	[]
Other	8	0	Oh that should be fun, m'kay.  Ahhhh...	[]
Other	12	0	But first we have a very special guest. It's Woodsy Owl.	[]
Other	4	0	Oh boy! Woodsy Owl!	[]
Stan	3	0	Who's that?	[]
Other	8	0	Give a hoot, don't pollute, m'kay.	[]
Other	26	0	Hi, I'm Woodsy Owl, remindin' you all to please pick up your trash, and keep our forests clean. In the city or in the woods,	[]
Other	13	0	Help keep Americaaa lookin' good, m'kay.  Oh, boy I love that song.	[]
Other	21	0	Alright kids, time to split up and go into the forest. Let's divide you all up into groups of six.	[]
Other	7	0	We wanna be in Mackey's group!	[]
Other	18	0	Oh no, that that's m'kay. We'll uh we'll get paired with someone else uh.	[]
Other	15	0	That's fine. You six boys can team up and be our first group in.	[]
Other	8	0	Oh no, oh God here it comes, unkay?	[]
Other	10	0	Is this the dream, or the dream within the dream?	[]
Other	12	0	I think it's the dream inside the Matrix inside the dream!	[]
Other	5	0	Oh well. Just keep shooting!	[]
Stan	3	1	What the fuck?	['fuck']
Other	2	0	Mommy? Mommy?	[]
Other	18	0	So you're saying that all those people in there are somehow trapped in one person's dream?	[]
Other	19	0	Yes, and so that's why I called the fire department. I don't know where else to turn.	[]
Other	13	0	Well, wait, if those people got stuck in there, why wouldn't we?	[]
Other	24	0	It's very simple: You see,  when the dream experts go in, they attempt to take the subject to a dream within a dream.	[]
Other	6	0	Like a taco within a taco?	[]
Other	5	0	A double-decker taco supreme.	[]
Other	27	0	Exactly. But only dream spies have the ability to go deeper into dream levels, and firemen have the ability to bring ladders into other people's dreams.	[]
Other	13	0	Wait wait whoa whoa, how can you take a ladder into a dream?	[]
Other	22	0	Because the firemen dreams aren't like dreams at all. They're more like a dream within a matrix within a dream.	[]
Other	4	0	Somebody order a pizza?	[]
Other	1	0	No.	[]
Other	7	0	Probably one of them in the dream.	[]
Other	5	0	Alright, I'm goin' in.	[]
Other	38	0	Look, if we can get the fire department into the counselor's dream, then we can jump everyone down at least another six dream levels. That way we'll be in the counselor's deepest level of subconscious.	[]
Other	27	0	And it will be like a taco, inside a taco, within a Taco Bell, that's inside a KFC, within a mall, that's INSIDE YOUR BRAIN!	[]
Other	6	0	Aaaaaah! Not again, m'kay! Aaaaaah!	[]
Stan	4	0	Mr. Mackey, stop running!	[]
Other	16	1	But, but they're gonna kick my butt, m'kay!  They're gonna kick it bad!	['butt']
Stan	33	0	Look, dude!  Whatever happened with those bullies, you just have to stop running and face it! It's just a dream dude! You can control what happens. Stand up to them this time.	[]
Other	21	0	I know what about? I don't remember what they did. I just remember the field trip being really bad, okay.	[]
Other	8	0	There he is! You can't run forever!	[]
Other	10	0	Oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god...	[]
Stan	22	0	Mr. Mackey, go, and face it! Please. So that we can get out of here and find out why we're hoarding.	[]
Other	5	0	But I literally herd sheep.	[]
Stan	2	0	Shut up!	[]
Other	17	0	Okay. Okay, I can do this. I'm just gonna stand and, and face what happens, okay?	[]
Other	4	0	Somebody... order pizza? Pizza?	[]
Other	9	0	Mr. Mackey must be dreaming about something extremely traumatic.	[]
Other	7	0	Alright, that does it.  Get your coat.	[]
Other	4	0	Where are we going?	[]
Other	14	0	We need to get help from the most powerful dream infiltrator in the world.	[]
Other	4	0	You don't mean...	[]
Other	6	0	Hello, Freddy.  You're looking healthy.	[]
Other	12	0	Chinstrap! What happened? You run out of stoolies to do your work?	[]
Other	20	0	Alright, look, we're in a pickle again and we need your help. Got some people trapped inside a dream.	[]
Other	10	0	Told you a long time ago: I gave that up.	[]
Other	8	0	There's some good men stuck in there.	[]
Other	7	0	I said I'm done with it!	[]
Other	4	0	Everything all right, Fred?	[]
Other	9	0	It's fine, Peg. Get back in the house.	[]
Other	3	0	Wife and kids.	[]
Other	4	0	No thanks to you.	[]
Other	4	0	We need ya Fred.	[]
Other	12	0	Like you needed me to kill those teenagers to stop the Russians?!	[]
Other	6	0	We had a country to protect!	[]
Other	5	0	Protect it yourselves this time.	[]
Other	10	1	Dammit I'm not working for the military anymore, Krueger!	['dammit']
Other	9	0	Then you should have no problem covering it up.	[]
Other	13	0	Some of those trapped are firemen. Public servants, innocent in all of this.	[]
Other	2	0	Alright, fine.	[]
Other	23	0	Alright Billy, I'm not gonna let you hurt me this time, hm'kay? This time I'm gonna stand up for myself!	[]
Other	9	0	You? Gonna fight back? I don't think so!	[]
Stan	6	0	You can do it Mr. Mackey.	[]
Other	15	0	Go ahead and do your worst, Billy. I'm facing you head-on, m'kay?	[]
Other	4	0	Alright Mackey. Take this.	[]
Other	9	0	Get the perimeter secure! Make sure they're dead!	[]
Stan	3	1	What the hell?	['hell']
Other	8	0	We got 'em! The bad memories are dead.	[]
Other	10	0	Alright everyone, this is the fire department. Do not panic.	[]
Stan	4	0	Who are you people?	[]
Other	14	0	We came here to rescue you from the bad guys in Mackey's dream.	[]
Stan	15	0	Well uh, wouldn't it be better to have Mackey face them on his own?	[]
Other	17	0	No. As long as the source of the drama is wiped out, the counselor can wake up.	[]
Other	1	0	Right.	[]
Stan	8	0	...Well then why aren't we waking up?	[]
Other	13	0	Unless... the bullies aren't the source of the counselor's bad memory.	[]
Other	20	0	Hey that's right. The bullies didn't even beat me up that day. I, I ran away from them.	[]
Other	2	0	Oh, whoops.	[]
Other	34	0	I remember.  I ran and I ran and I hid in this building here. And somebody was in there. Somebody who talked to me real nice and then... and then touched me somewhere bad.	[]
Other	19	0	No Woodsy! Hmkay? Don't touch muh pee pee. No Woodsy, please. I'll give a hoot, hm'kay?	[]
Other	18	0	Woodsy Owl! No! I'll never litter again! I'll keep all my trash! No please Woodsy no!	[]
Other	3	0	What's happening?	[]
Other	5	0	Dream conundrum. This is bad.	[]
Other	6	1	What the hell's going on?	['hell']
Other	19	0	The bad memory is manifesting itself! It didn't wanna be exposed!  Our dream bullets don't hurt it.	[]
Other	4	0	No! No more, Woodsy.	[]
Stan	8	0	Mr. Mackey, you have to wake up now!	[]
Other	15	0	He can't! Don't you get it?! We're all gonna go to limbo!	[]
Other	8	0	There's a real hoot for ya, Woodsy!	[]
Other	7	0	It's dead... It's finally dead.	[]
Other	12	0	Something's happening. I'm getting Bogart levels on all counter ups.	[]
Other	8	0	They're waking up. They're coming to.	[]
Other	5	0	Ahhh, you're back, everyone!	[]
Randy	2	1	Aw, dammit.	['dammit']
Other	2	0	Thanks, Freddy.	[]
