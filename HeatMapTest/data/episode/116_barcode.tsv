Cartman	8	0	Yes. I will be your new best friend.	[]
Butters	2	0	Oh wow!	[]
Butters	65	0	Yep. That's right. He's a real live robot. He can walk and talk and everything. You're like the fourth kid I told already.  Well I gotta go Dougie. My robot and I have stuff to do.  Heheh, they're all so jealous!  I'm so glad you came into my life, AWESOM-O. You're the best friend a guy could have.	[]
Cartman	35	0	Yes. You can trust AWESOM-O. In fact, you should tell AWESOM-O all your most personal secrets. AWESOM-O will not make fun of you or tell your secrets to other people and stuff.	[]
Butters	31	0	Hey yeah! Well, I can tell you anything, huh?  Well lessee... Well, for one, I have what's called a hesiated colon, which means I sometime can't control my sphincter.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Really?	[]
Butters	23	1	Well, nobody knows it, but sometimes I poop my pants, so I have to wear a diaper to school.  You okay, AWESOM-O?	['poop']
Cartman	8	0	Yes. AWESOM-O is fine. Please go on.	[]
Butters	22	0	Well, I have to take medicine for it every day. It's a little suppository I have to... put up my rectum.	[]
Cartman	10	0	That, that's very interesting. Tell AWESOM-O more secrets.	[]
Butters	39	0	Hm, okay. Let's see  Oh, my parents don't know, but sometimes I get picked on by this one kid at school; his name is Eric Cartman, and he always tries to play jokes on me and stuff.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Oh, really?	[]
Butters	26	0	Yeah. One time he made me think a meteor had hit the earth, and convinced me to stay down in a bomb shelter for three days.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Heh. Wow, that sucks.	[]
Butters	30	1	Yeah. And then this other time, he pretended to be me on the phone to my dad and called him a pussy, so my dad came home and beat me.	['pussy']
Cartman	9	0	Wow. Sounds like this Cartman kid is pretty smart.	[]
Butters	20	1	No, he's not smart! He's just an asshole. And he's never gonna play on me ever again!	['asshole']
Cartman	14	0	Really? You think so? Well, guess what, Butters. I have a surprise for you.	[]
Butters	23	0	Yeah, and he's never gonna get me again! 'Cause what Cartman doesn't know is that I know one of his secrets!	[]
Cartman	1	0	What?	[]
Butters	35	0	When Cartman is playing all alone in his backyard, he likes to dress up like Britney Spears and pretend he's her! He sings and dances around with a life-sized cutout of Justin Timberlake.	[]
Cartman	3	0	You saw that?	[]
Butters	7	0	Yeah! And I videotaped him doing it!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Nuh uh.	[]
Butters	17	0	I've got the whole thing on tape! Even him making out with the Justin Timberlake cutout!	[]
Cartman	2	0	No way.	[]
Butters	25	0	Yeah! And if Cartman ever messes with me again, I'm gonna show that video to everybody! Then I'll have my revenge, boy howdy!	[]
Cartman	6	0	...Um, where is this videotape, Butters?	[]
Butters	19	0	Huh? Oh, I dunno. It's around here somewhere. Hey! So what do you wanna do now, AWESOM-O?	[]
Cartman	10	0	Uh, Butters, maybe you should give AWESOM-O the videotape?	[]
Butters	2	0	How come?	[]
Cartman	20	0	Well, because... AWESOM-O can, like, back it up for you, and make copies and stuff. I am AWESOM-O.	[]
Butters	18	0	Oh, that's all right, AWESOM-O. Come on! I have a lot of things to teach you.	[]
Cartman	5	1	Oh, son of a bitch!	['bitch']
Butters	72	0	Hey there have you heard about my robot friend? He's metal and small and doesn't judge me at all. He's a cyber, wired bundle of joy. My robot friend. I like to dip and daddle with my robot friend. He's smart as can be and emotion-free And he's computed his way to my heart. My robot friend. My robot friend. My robot friend. My robot... friend.	[]
Other	15	0	Oohhh, that's so cute. Did you see Butters and his friend Eric playing Robot.	[]
Other	19	0	Yes. Those boys are quite imaginative. Leave it to them to find a fun way to do the dishes.	[]
Butters	14	0	That's great AWESOM-O!  You can carry all my laundry in one trip!	[]
Other	14	0	Ah, Butters, it's getting late. You should be getting ready for bed soon.	[]
Butters	8	0	Okay Mom. Well, come on, AWESOM-O. Bedtime.	[]

Butters	12	0	Well of course he is. He's my robot, ain't he?	[]

Cartman	26	0	Grrr. Jesus Christ I can't go on like this.  Butters, remember when you said you had a video of Eric Cartman dressed like Britney Spears?	[]
Butters	2	0	Oh. Yeah.	[]
Cartman	22	0	I would like to see what he looks like so I can beat him up for you. May I see the video?	[]
Butters	21	0	Awww, you don't need to do that, AWESOM-O. Hey, I gotta put in my suppository.  Can you help me?	[]
Cartman	1	0	What?	[]
Butters	24	0	Remember I said I put that medicinal suppository in my anus? It'll be so much easier havin' you do it from now on.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Um. Actually, AWESOM-O was not programmed for that function.	[]
Butters	38	0	Haw, it's real easy. I'll show you. You just take this little thingy out of the plastic... paper, and I'll, I'll pull down my pants ...and just slide it up in my anus there.	[]
Cartman	2	0	...No way.	[]
Butters	13	0	AWESOM-O, I though you were programmed to do whatever I tell you.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Weak!	[]
Butters	14	0	Ye- yeah, that, that's pretty good. Get it up there good and deep.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Lame!	[]
Butters	40	0	All right AWESOM-O, time for us to get some sleep.  Hey, you want me to teach you some bedtime songs? If you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me. Ooo-oo-oooo-oo-oo...	[]
Cartman	8	0	AWESOM-O must rest! His CPU system overloading.	[]
Butters	20	0	Oh, o-o-all right AWESOM-O. Let's get us some shut-eye,  or what, or whatever robots have.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Where is it? Where is it?!	[]
Butters	2	0	AWESOM-O?!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Wah!	[]
Butters	9	0	AWESOM-O, what the Sam Heck are you doing?	[]
Cartman	10	0	Um, ah AWESOM-O is reorganizing your stuff for you.	[]
Butters	42	0	Aw Jeez, Jeez Louise! My mom is gonna be awful sore when she sees this mess! Now AWESOM-O, that is a bad robot! You can't do no chores for me unless I tell you to do them! You got it?!	[]
Cartman	3	0	AWESOM-O understands.	[]
Butters	39	0	Now I'm gonna have to give ya a spankin', AWESOM-O, so that you'll learn better!  Just know, AWESOM-O, that I did it because I love you. Okay, come on, let's go make some breakfast.	[]
Cartman	7	1	Goddamnit, I have to find that videotape!	['goddamnit']
Butters	29	0	Look at that, AWESOM-O! I drew a picture of us playing in a field together.  Ah I'll be right back. I'm gonna get some Sunny Delight.	[]
Cartman	7	0	I would like some Sunny Delight too.	[]
Butters	23	0	Don't be silly, AWESOM-O. Robots don't need to drink nothin'.  Uh, heehee.  Whoa. Uh, go answer the door, AWESOM-O.	[]
Cartman	6	0	AWESOM-O will answers the door.	[]
Kyle	7	1	What the hell are you doing, fatass?	['hell']

Butters	17	0	Hey he sure is! We do everything together. Why last night we even had a slumber party.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Weak.	[]
Butters	26	0	He can do anything I command him to. He's real smart. Watch this: Hey AWESOM-O, will you go get my friends some Sunny Delight?	[]
Cartman	3	0	Yes, of course.	[]
Kyle	24	0	Oh wait. Hey AWESOM-O,  I'd also like some celery sticks chopped up two inches long, with peanut butter and raisins on top.	[]
Cartman	4	1	Suck my balls, Kyle.	['balls']
Butters	5	0	He's made in Japan!	[]
Other	21	0	Yes, it has just been a delight having your son over, Mrs. Cartman. He and Butters are really getting along great.	[]
Other	18	0	Oh, I'm so glad to hear it, Mrs. Stotch. Eric has been having some emotional problems lately.	[]
Other	39	0	Well, the reason I'm calling is that Butters is supposed to go see his Aunt Nellie in Los Angeles this weekend. The boys are getting along so well, that we were thinking of inviting Eric to go along.	[]
Other	23	1	Oh, well, I'm not sure. Actually, Eric is still supposed to be grounded for trying to exterminate the Jews two weeks ago.	['jews']
Other	7	0	Excuse me, I didn't catch that.	[]
Other	23	0	Oh, but I suppose it would be good for him. Yes, of course he can go. I'll bring some of clothes over.	[]
Other	8	0	Oh, wonderful! The boys will be so excited.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Maybe he put that videotape in here somewhere.	[]
Butters	15	0	AWESOM-O, what are you doing? My friends are waiting for their beverages. Chop chop!	[]
Other	21	0	Hey guys, great news! It's been arranged: you two are both going to Los Angeles to visit Butters' Aunt Nellie!	[]
Butters	13	0	Oh boy! My robot gets to come with me to see Aunt Nellie?!	[]
Cartman	1	0	What?	[]
Butters	12	0	Oh boy,  AWESOM-O! We're gonna have the best time ever!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Lame.	[]
Other	10	0	Hey Nellie, guess what I found scrampin' around the airport.	[]
Butters	3	0	Hi Aunt Nellie!	[]
Other	9	0	There's my little nephew! How was your flight?	[]
Butters	15	0	It was long. We had a three-hour delay... departin' Denver, but we're here!	[]
Other	6	0	Didn't ya bring any bags?	[]
Butters	9	0	Well, sure, but my robot is bringin' them in.	[]
Other	2	0	Your robot?	[]
Other	14	0	Butters' new friend is a little strange. He, he really takes playing Robot seriously.	[]
Butters	10	0	There he is! AWESOM-O, this is my Aunt Nellie.	[]
Other	8	0	Hello! It's nice to have you here.	[]
Cartman	12	0	AWESOM-O must dispense oil waste. Where is the nearest toilet, please?	[]
Other	7	0	Oh oh, right through there, Mr. Robot.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Thank you.	[]
Other	12	0	I don't think he took the costume off the entire trip.	[]
Other	19	0	Well, did you wanna get right to sight-seeing, or are you guys hungry after such a long flight.	[]
Butters	19	0	Nah, I ate on the plane. And AWESOM-O is a robot, so he don't need to eat.	[]
Other	1	0	Right...	[]
Butters	2	0	AWESOM-O?	[]
Cartman	6	0	Aw- Aw- AWESOM-O is coming.	[]
Butters	10	0	Come on, AWESOM-O! We're gonna go a- sightseein'!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Argh!	[]
Butters	39	0	I'm hangin' out in LA with my robot friend We're havin' such fun in the hot hot sun We're two of a kind- That's me! And my robot friend. My robot friend. My robot ...friend.	[]
Butters	20	0	Can you believe we're at a real live movie studio, AWESOM-O? Aren't we havin' the best time?!	[]
Cartman	19	0	Butters, wouldn't you like to have some time away from AWESOM-O? We could meet up later, perhaps?	[]
Butters	31	0	Hey, look over there, AWESOM-O. The film studio commissary.  That's where all them rich movie producers who come up with uh, Hollywood blockbusters have their lunch. Neat-o, huh?	[]
Other	20	1	Damnit, Mitch. How come our movie studio can't come up with any winners? I mean, we're smart, right?	['damnit']
Other	4	0	We're really smart.	[]
Other	26	0	We need an idea for a movie that's a home run. A feel-good romp for the whole family.  Hey, what's that over there?	[]
Other	13	0	Wow, that's a really neat little robot you have there, little boy.	[]
Other	4	0	What's he do?	[]
Butters	19	0	Well, he can do anything. Watch this: Hey, AWESOM-O, who's gonna win the Super Bowl next year?	[]
Cartman	4	0	The New Orleans Saints.	[]
Other	16	0	Hey, Mr. Robot, how much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?	[]
Cartman	1	0	Seventeen.	[]
Other	8	0	Mitch, are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?	[]
Other	13	0	Yeah. Maybe that robot can be programmed to come up with movie ideas!	[]
Other	1	0	Exactly!	[]
Other	26	0	Gentlemen, this little boy was kind enough to let us show you his robot. The AWESOM-O 4000.  I've already seen what it can do.	[]
Other	11	0	Uh, excuse me sir, but uh, that's not a robot.	[]
Other	3	0	It's not?	[]
Other	13	0	No, it clearly had bipedal movement, so the correct term is computerized automatron.	[]
Other	4	0	Oh, very nice, Mitch.	[]
Other	5	0	You are the smart one.	[]
Other	16	0	Well, regardless, I believe maybe this automatron can help us come up with new movie ideas.	[]
Other	13	0	How can a robot come up with better ideas for movies than us?	[]
Other	31	0	Watch this: AWESOM-O, given the current trends of the movie-going public can you come up with an idea for a movie that will break a hundred million box office?	[]
Cartman	29	0	Um... okay. How about this:  Adam Sandler is like, in love with some girl, but then it turns out that the girl is actually a... golden retriever, or something.	[]
Other	2	0	Oh, perfect!	[]
Other	6	0	We'll call it Puppy Love!	[]
Other	7	0	Give us another movie idea, AWESOM-O!	[]
Other	2	0	Yeah, yeah!	[]
Other	4	0	Let's hear it!	[]
Other	5	0	Yeah, we wanna hear it!	[]
Other	4	0	Come on, come on!	[]
Cartman	22	0	Okay, how about this: Adam Sandler... inherits like, a billion dollars, but first, he has to, like, become a... boxer, or something.	[]
Other	4	0	... Yes, it's flawless!	[]
Other	3	0	Punch-Drunk Billionaire!	[]
Butters	23	0	Boy, Los Angeles is great, huh AWESOM-O? Can you believe those guys paid us a hundred dollars apiece for those movie ideas?	[]
Cartman	16	0	You should split that money with AWESOM-O. After all, they were AWESOM-O's ideas.	[]
Butters	42	0	Hahaa, right! What are you gonna do with money, AWESOM-O? Buy some robot pants? Haha, no! We got each other and that's all we need, AWESOM-O. I'm gonna send this money to needy kids in third-world countries.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Haaaa! Haaaa!	[]
Butters	5	0	Yoe, you okay AWESOM-O?	[]
Cartman	7	0	AWESOM-O needs to rest! Feeling faint.	[]
Butters	18	0	Well you go ahead and relax, AWESOM-O. We've got another full day of pitching movies tomorrow.	[]
Other	87	0	Gentlemen, Ladies, we all know that we live in a time of uncertainty. The risk of an attack on American soil is higher than ever. Now, I believe we may be able to curb that risk. Two days ago our intelligence department came across this:  The AWESOM-O 4000. It is currently being used by Catamount Pictures to develop ideas for movies. Our sources say that in just one week it has come up with over one thousand movie ideas, eight hundred of which feature Adam Sandler.	[]
Other	3	0	That's incredible!	[]
Other	15	0	You're thinking the robot could be used to come up with anti-Islamic movies?	[]
Other	20	0	No. If we got our hands on that robot, we could re-program it and turn it into a weapon!.	[]
Other	9	0	Yes, that might be the best thing to do.	[]
Other	11	0	Uh huh. I don't see how we have a choice.	[]
Other	19	0	Hold on a second: If that robot is designed for entertainment, then, turning it into a weapon is unethical.	[]
Other	40	0	Unethical? Let me explain something to you, Mr. Scientist! We understand that the robot is from Japan! That means that the Japanese have more of them! And if the Japanese fabricates one of them into a weapon before we do...	[]
Other	9	0	Jesus. It would be Pearl Harbor all over again.	[]
Other	4	0	But worse. With robots.	[]
Other	22	0	I I'm sorry, I must protest. We, we have no data suggesting the Japanese have developed a robot with offensive capability.	[]
Other	23	0	You're paid to think, Mr. Scientist! National security is our jub.  Gentlemen, we're going to Los Angeles!  I want that robot!	[]
Butters	24	0	Yeah, me and my robot are still over at the movie studio, Aunt Nellie. We're makin' all sorts of money for the poor.	[]
Cartman	23	0	Movie idea number two thousand three hundred and five: Adam Sandler is trapped on an island and falls in love with a coconut.	[]
Other	35	0	Great, AWESOM-O, great. Uh guys, take a break. I need a minute alone with AWESOM-O.  You are an incredible robot, AWESOM-O. I was just wondering... are you by chance a... pleasure model?	[]
Cartman	1	0	...What?	[]
Other	10	0	Well, have you been programmed to... satisfy... urges of humans?	[]
Cartman	5	0	AWESOM-O does not understand.	[]
Other	7	0	Let me show you what I mean.	[]
Butters	17	0	Well yeah, we're havin' a great time, Aunt Nellie. These movie studio guys are real nice.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Lame!	[]
Butters	14	0	Yeah, we're makin' a bunch more money. I can't believe it either.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Not cool! Totally lame!	[]
Butters	24	0	AWESOM-O? Well, I gotta go, Aunt Nellie. Ah, AWESOM-O is havin' some kind of malfunction.  AWESOM-O? Hey, where'd ya go?	[]
Cartman	1	0	Waaaaa!	[]
Other	5	0	Let's go! Move, move!	[]
Butters	15	0	AWESOM-O?  Hey, what are you doin' with him?!  That's my robot!  AWESOM-OOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!	[]
Other	7	0	Are those arm and leg locks secure?	[]
Other	2	0	Secure, sir!	[]
Other	21	0	Good. I don't want that robot mobile until I know what it's capable of. All right, power it on.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Whoa, whoa, wha- whoa, whoa!	[]
Other	3	1	What the hell?	['hell']
Other	4	0	What's going on?	[]
Other	5	0	It... powered itself back on.	[]
Other	7	0	Stand by. Be ready to destroy it.	[]
Cartman	11	1	Where the hell am I?! Hey, why can't I move?!	['hell']
Other	11	0	Are your systems stable? Run a systems check on your CPU.	[]
Cartman	7	1	The fuck are you talkin' about, dude?!	['fuck']
Other	11	0	Ah, I'm sorry, robot,  they want me to reprogram you.	[]
Cartman	9	0	I'm not a robot, dumbass! I'm alive!	[]
Other	4	0	What did you say?	[]
Cartman	8	0	I said I'm a real person, asswipe!	[]
Other	3	0	...Oh my God.	[]
Other	3	0	What's happening?	[]
Other	11	0	The robot... It thinks it's alive. It's developed consciousness.	[]
Other	5	0	What? How can that be?	[]
Other	13	0	Must be a malfunction of its exographical IMS or the... interlaced BV system.	[]
Other	9	0	Speak in a language we can understand, Mr. Scientist!	[]
Other	9	0	Your robot doesn't know it's a robot!	[]
Cartman	6	1	Goddamnit, get me down from here!	['goddamnit']
Other	4	0	Who made you, robot?	[]
Cartman	9	0	I'm not a robot, I'm a human!	[]
Other	5	0	Jesus, the scientist was right.	[]
Other	14	0	But, who would have programmed it to think it was human? The movie studio?	[]
Cartman	16	1	Look, retards! My name is Eric Cartman! I live with my mom in South Park, Colorado!	['retards']
Other	7	0	Dear Christ, they gave it memories, too.	[]
Other	40	0	Sure, why not? Program the memories of some eight-year-old boy who doesn't exist, and make the robot think he's real! Makes for a lot better movies! I'm not reprogramming a robot that's developed consciousness!	[]
Other	41	0	Do I have to remind you of your position?! Don't forget you have a duty to your country,  Mr. Scientist!! I want that robot's memories and consciousness E-RASED, so we can take it back to Washington! GOT IT?!	[]
Other	5	2	Damn you all to hell!	['damn', 'hell']
Butters	31	0	Hey there, did you know I had a robot friend? We used to laugh and play, but someone took him away. He was my ten gigahertz old pal. My robot friend.	[]
Butters	13	0	Hey, wait a minute.  Why, that's the van that-  Oh my God!	[]
Cartman	8	1	Goddamnit, stop! I'm real! I'm real!	['goddamnit']
Other	7	0	It'll all be over soon, robot!	[]
Other	10	0	Hang on! I'm getting you out of here, robot!	[]
Cartman	7	1	Aw, it's about freaking time, jackass!	['jackass']
Other	6	1	What the hell are you doing?!	['hell']
Other	20	0	Well I- I'm saving a conscious being! If you wanna kill it, you'll have to go through me!	[]
Other	7	1	Fine. Kill that son of a bitch!	['bitch']
Cartman	14	2	No! Look, Goddamnit! Now I can show you stupid assholes who I really am!	['goddamnit', 'assholes']
Butters	2	0	AWESOM-O!	[]
Cartman	6	0	I am the AWESOM-O 4000.	[]
Butters	21	0	No!  No, please!  Don't kill him! He's my best friend! He's my best friend in the whole world!	[]
Other	30	0	There. You see? You want to tell me this isn't humanity? Who's to judge what makes something human anyway?!  Does this make me human?!  Or this?!  Or these?!	[]
Other	48	1	Perhaps... there is consciousness in this robot. Maybe we as a society need to realize that artificial intelligence... is intelligence all the same, and we can learn from the robots. I think maybe one day we can all-  Hey, wait a minute, did, did that robot just fart?	['fart']
Butters	5	1	Hey, robots don't fart!	['fart']
Cartman	5	1	Uh... now ending fart sequence.	['fart']
Other	6	0	Oh, and it, it smells, too!	[]
Cartman	3	0	Smell sequence initiated.	[]
Other	11	1	A robot with smelly farts? That doesn't make any sense.	['farts']
Butters	5	0	Hang on a second, here!	[]
Cartman	61	1	Would you like to touch my body? Come on and touch my body! Oooo, my hot body! Don't you like my hot body? Come on and touch my titties! I felt them just like? Come on Justin, touch my body! Mmm, Justin, yeah! Touch my body! You and me! Check it out, my not-hot body! Come on, my body!	['titties']
Other	7	1	Wow, kid, you're a little faggot!	['faggot']
Cartman	1	0	Lame...	[]
