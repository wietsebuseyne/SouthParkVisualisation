Cartman	2	0	Okay, Mom.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Ready to go hunting, Cartman?	[]
Stan	14	0	Yeah, my Uncle Jimbo says we gotta get up there early. Right, Uncle Jimbo?	[]

Other	11	0	Here hon, I packed you some cheesy poofs and happy tarts.	[]
Other	23	0	Don't worry Mrs. Cartman, we'll take good care of him. I brought my old war buddy Ned to keep things safe.	[]

Other	21	2	Be sure to use lots of bug spray, and if you have to poo-poo, don't wipe with poison ivy.	['poo', 'poo']
Cartman	5	0	Dude, that's sick mom.	[]
Other	19	0	And I know it can get scary up in those woods, but just remember, mommy's not far away.	[]

Other	11	0	That's the spirit boys, let's get that testosterone flowin'.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Eeeh!	[]
Other	60	0	Now boys, boys, ah-I need to get serious for a minute. I want you to understand a few basic rules of hunting, since this is your first time. First, don't ever walk with your gun unless the safety's on. Second, don't shoot anything that looks human, and third, never spill your beer in the bullet chamber.	[]
Stan	8	0	Uh, Uncle Jimbo, we don't drink beer.	[]
Other	2	0	You what?!?	[]
Other	16	0	Moh Yeah, that's right, I don't think eight year old kids drink beer, mmm.	[]
Kyle	4	0	I like chocolate milk.	[]
Other	36	0	Well, we'll be doing plenty of drinking on this trip; After all, hunting sober is like ... fishing ... sober. It sure will be nice to get out of the city for a while, away from civilization.	[]
Other	18	0	Well, here we are. Okay, each of you young 'uns take a gun, a beer and some smokes.	[]
Cartman	17	0	Hey, I didn't get a gun.  Sweet. This is like the gun I used in 'Nam	[]

Stan	15	0	My Uncle Jimbo says that after this, he's gonna take me hunting in Africa.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Wow, that'd be cool.	[]
Cartman	12	0	My mom says there's a lot of black people in Africa.	[]
Other	31	0	Boys, looky there. That there's a Rocky Mountain black bear ...one of the few remaining of its kind. Isn't it beautiful... By God, it's coming right for us!	[]
Stan	13	0	Hey, it wasn't coming right for us. It was just sitting there.	[]
Other	11	0	Shhh, not so loud. Now that there's just a technicality.	[]
Kyle	4	0	What do you mean?	[]
Other	17	0	You see boys, the Democrats have passed a lot of laws trying to stop us from hunting.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Democrats piss me off!	[]
Other	31	0	They say we can't shoot certain animals anymore, unless they're posing an immediate threat. Therefore, before we shoot somethin', we have to say 'It's coming right for us.'	[]
Stan	6	0	Wow, you're smart Uncle Jimbo.	[]
Other	4	0	Mmm, Jimbo look, mm.	[]
Other	18	0	Ohho, it's a deer. Looks like about a .46 gauge, Ned. It's coming right for us!	[]

Other	7	0	Mmm, oh, it hurts, it hurts, mmm.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Hey you guys, this works pretty good right now.	[]
Chef	20	0	But you see Mr. Mayor, you can't stop serving Salisbury steak in our public schools. What's next, meatloaf?	[]
Other	9	0	We are quite aware of your concerns Chef, but...	[]
Other	8	0	Mayor, the geologist is here to see you.	[]
Other	17	0	My geologist? Now? Tell him the infection is fine and I don't need another check-up.	[]
Other	11	0	No mayor, that's a gynecologist. A geologist studies the earth.	[]
Other	27	0	Don't you think I know that? How dare you insult my intellect, I went to Princeton for God's sake! You get out of my office!	[]
Other	15	0	I'm not in your office mayor, I'm talking to you through a speaker.	[]

Other	1	0	Geologist...	[]
Other	4	0	You are fired, buddy!	[]
Other	10	0	Thank you mayor, it's been great working for you.	[]
Randy	14	0	Mayor, we have got a very big problem. Mt. Evanston is about to erupt.	[]
Other	7	0	What does this mean to the town?	[]
Randy	15	0	Well, this graph shows everything from normal to bad.  Right now South Park is here.	[]
Other	2	0	My God!	[]
Chef	14	0	Mayor, some of the school children, are up camping, on that mountain, right now!	[]
Other	9	0	Ooh, this is big! Johnson, Johnson, are you there?	[]
Other	11	0	Uhh, you just fired Johnson, Mayor. I'm his replacement, Ted.	[]

Other	40	1	You see... Ned picked up the grenade and... BOOM, blasted his arm clear off. We spent three hours looking for that damn arm, but it was never to be found. Some say it's still crawling around to this day.	['damn']

Kyle	8	0	No, No thanks, that stuff tastes like pee.	[]
Stan	4	0	Yeah, Cartman's pee.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Hey, you would taste my pee!	[]
Other	34	3	What the hell's wrong with you? Can't you have a little alcohol?  Christ, look at that little bastard go!  Now you see that Stan? Now, now that is a dirty little bastard!	['hell', 'bastard', 'bastard']
Stan	8	1	Hey, I'm a dirty little bastard too.	['bastard']
Cartman	8	0	Hey you guys. I know a scary story.	[]
Kyle	8	0	Shut up, Cartman! You can't scare anybody!	[]
Cartman	9	1	Oh yeah? Have you guys ever heard of  Scuzzlebutt?	['scuzzlebutt']
Stan	1	1	Whatabutt?	['whatabutt']
Cartman	20	1	Scuzzlebutt is a creature that lives up on this very mountain, and kills anybody who dares climb to the top.	['scuzzlebutt']
Stan	1	0	Why?	[]
Cartman	16	0	Because, it loves the taste of blood, and likes to add pieces to its deformed body.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Deformed how?	[]
Cartman	11	0	Well, on his left arm, instead of a hand, he has...	[]
Stan	2	0	A hook.	[]
Kyle	2	0	A knife.	[]
Cartman	5	0	No! A piece of celery.	[]
Stan	1	0	Celery?	[]
Cartman	26	0	Yeah, and he walks with a limp. Because one of his legs is missing. And where his leg should be, there's nothing but...Patrick Duffy.	[]
Kyle	9	1	Patrick Duffy? Damn it Cartman, that's not scary!	['damn']
Cartman	41	0	What do you mean? Have you ever seen Step By Step?  So he lives alone on this mountain, and weaves baskets, and other assorted crafts. They say that on quiet nights you can hear him weaving his baskets. Tahink ... tahink ... tahink.	[]
Stan	7	0	Cartman, you suck at telling scary stories.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Yeah, give me that flashlight.	[]
Kenny	4	0	(Hey, what's that?)	[]
Kyle	3	0	What is that?	[]
Stan	11	1	Maybe it's Scuzzlebutt coming to weave us into wicker baskets.	['scuzzlebutt']
Cartman	4	0	Hey, it might be!	[]
Kyle	12	0	Gosh, I hope he doesn't cut me with his celery hand.	[]
Cartman	6	1	Screw you guys! ... Go to Hell!	['hell']
Other	18	0	Hey Ned, why don't you whip out the ol' cancer kazoo? Let's do a little song.	[]
Other	27	0	Abumbayah my lord, kumbayah. Kumbayah my lord, kumbayah.  Uumbayah my lord, kumbayah.  Moh lord, Kumbayah. Emsomeone's crying my lord, Kumbayah Someone's crying my lord, Kumbayah...	[]
Cartman	29	3	They don't think Scuzzlebutt is scary huh? Let's see how they like it when they actually see Scuzzlebutt! I'll scare the hell out of them tomorrow!	['scuzzlebutt', 'scuzzlebutt', 'hell']
Other	9	0	... Someone's crying my lord, Kumbayah. Moh lord, Kumbayah.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Stan, Stan, wake up!	[]
Stan	2	0	What, dude?	[]
Kyle	13	0	I don't know where Cartman is. I think something took him away.	[]
Stan	7	0	Where's my Uncle Jimbo and Ned?	[]
Kyle	6	0	They're out fishing with Kenny.	[]
Stan	25	0	With Kenny? But, but this is supposed to be my camping trip. Why do they like Kenny so much? Doesn't he like me anymore?	[]
Kyle	9	0	Well Stan, you want to know what I think?	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Other	15	0	What a beautiful morning for fishing. There's one, there's a fish right there!	[]
Other	3	0	Mmm, got it.	[]
Other	3	0	Great instincts boy.	[]
Stan	5	0	Uncle Jimbo, Cartman's missing!	[]
Other	4	1	Who? The fat kid?	['fat']
Stan	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Other	34	1	Ah hell, I guess we better go look for him. Ned, we got to cut it short. Fire out the 12-20!  Well, I think that's about the limit for our fishing permit.	['hell']
Other	8	0	Moh man it smells like dead fish here.	[]
Kenny	5	1	(A little like a vagina.)	['vagina']
Other	6	0	Em-moh man, that is nasty.	[]
Other	23	0	Heh, I don't think I've ever seen a kid as cool as you Kenny. I'm making you... my honorary nephew.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Thanks.)	[]
Other	37	0	The people of South Park are humble and friendly. But now, a ticking timebomb of hot lava waits to engulf these people and end their miserable lives with one last fleeting moment of excruciatingly painful burning agony.	[]
Other	1	0	Yeahhh.	[]
Other	9	0	Hey, I'm on TV! I'm on TV!	[]
Other	11	0	Mayor, what are you doing to prepare for this inevitable catastrophe?	[]
Other	25	0	All we know right now is that some of our children  are camping on that mountain and... Oh, I'm sorry, can I start over?	[]
Other	1	0	Huh?	[]
Other	43	0	You can edit this right? Ready, 3,2,1  All we know right now is that some of our children are up camping on that mountain. We can't do anything until we get them. Okay people, let's go get those kids.	[]
Chef	9	0	Come on everybody. You got to help the children.	[]
Other	13	0	Uh, well, he couldn't have gone far, unless something drug him off.	[]
Other	9	0	There's not many animals out today, Jimbo, mmm.	[]
Other	18	0	Yeah, it's almost like something funny's going on.  Christ, Ned, what'd you have for breakfast.	[]
Other	12	0	Mm I don't know man. I've got some bad gas.	[]
Other	20	0	Wait, there's a ram! It's coming right for us!  Nice shootin' Kenny. Here, you need a bigger gun.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Look!	[]
Cartman	12	1	I am Scuzzlebutt, Lord of the Mountains. Behold my Patrick Duffy leg.	['scuzzlebutt']
Other	4	0	Mmm, what is it?	[]
Kyle	8	1	Dude, it's Scuzzlebutt! Cartman wasn't lying.	['scuzzlebutt']
Other	10	0	Holy crow! We could make a mint killing this thing.	[]
Other	9	0	We'll be on the cover of Guns & Ammo.	[]
Other	6	0	This calls for some HJ-14.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Heheh. Those guys are totally scared.	[]
Other	4	0	Fire in the hole!	[]
Cartman	2	1	Holy crap!	['crap']
Other	6	1	Damn it, I think I missed	['damn']
Cartman	8	1	What the hell is wrong with you people?!	['hell']
Other	6	0	C'mon, let's move, move!	[]
Cartman	3	0	Hey, wait, aah!	[]
Other	21	0	Is, is it on? Okay. Okay people, form groups and search the mountain. Report back here every hour! You got that?!	[]
Randy	6	0	Mayor, I might have an idea.	[]
Other	2	0	Huh, what?	[]
Randy	26	0	If we can dig a very large trench, we can divert the lava into a canyon, and then it would bypass South Park, pretty much completely.	[]
Other	6	0	And, that would be good? Alright?	[]
Randy	3	0	Uh - pretty sure.	[]
Other	16	0	Well, what are we waiting for. Okay, people, change of plans! Half of you grab shovels!	[]
Other	45	1	These look like its tracks. He must have gone this way. Ned, prepare some HK-12 and some plasticine. I'll bet that sucker's headed for a higher elevation. The higher up it- BIRD!!  The higher up it goes, the better it can breathe.	['sucker']
Kyle	3	0	Look, up there.	[]
Cartman	6	0	You guys, it's just me.	[]
Other	6	1	Are we sure it's Scuzzlebutt?	['scuzzlebutt']
Stan	8	0	Does it have Patrick Duffy for a leg	[]
Other	8	0	I can't tell; let's kill it!	[]
Cartman	9	0	Eh, I gotta get out of this stupid costume.	[]
Other	5	0	Kenny, you take the front.	[]
Stan	13	0	No!  I can do it Uncle Jimbo. I want to bag that animal!	[]
Other	8	0	That's the spirit, kiddo. Let's hunt!	[]
Cartman	8	0	You guys, you guys, I was just kidding!	[]
Other	26	0	As some people of South Park try desperately to save their mountain town, others look for the missing townspeople. But all must take every precaution necessary.	[]
Other	41	0	Okay people, listen up. As we near the top of the mountain, the chances of our encountering some lava becomes great. Therefore, I have special-ordered this training film to assist us in volcano safety. Mr. Garrison, if you would please.	[]
Other	109	0	Harbringers of sorrow, natural disasters can be the cause of troubling and undesirable stress, and the volcano is no exception. But what should you do if a volcano erupts near you or your family? Here we see the Stevens family enjoying a May picnic, but suddenly daughter hears a noise. It's a volcano. Junior seems worried. But have no fear Junior, Jane learned in school what to do when you hear a volcano erupt.  That's right Jane, duck and cover.  So what will you-do when you hear a volcano erupting?  That's right, duck and cover.  Looks like you got the idea.Thank you and goodbye.	[]
Other	3	0	OK, any questions?	[]
Chef	16	1	That has got to be the most ridiculous load of pig crap I have ever seen!	['crap']
Other	6	0	That's enough out of you!	[]
Stan	14	2	I'm gonna bag Scuzzlebutt. Then we'll see who's the little bastard.	['scuzzlebutt', 'bastard']
Cartman	4	0	Hey, seriously you guys!	[]
Kyle	10	0	Kill it, Stanley. Kill it.  Come on Stan, kill it.	[]
Stan	8	1	Ah, damn it, I can't do it!	['damn']
Other	6	0	You pansy! give me that gun.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Hey!	[]
Stan	1	0	Cartman?	[]
Cartman	5	1	Goddammit, don't shoot me!	['goddammit']
Other	4	1	What in Sam Hell?	['hell']
Cartman	15	0	I was just trying to scare you guys, you can put the guns down now.	[]
Other	9	0	Mmm, so much for the cover of Guns & Ammo.	[]
Other	14	0	Yepper, but I think we've learned some important lessons Ned I think that-	[]
Kyle	1	0	Whoa!	[]
Other	3	1	Mmm, holy crap.	['crap']
Other	8	0	The mountain! It's blown it's top!	[]
Kyle	6	0	Oh my God, they killed Kenny!	[]
Kenny	11	0	(Nope, I'm okay.)  (It-aah. It hurts! IT HURTS!)  (Ugh.)	[]
Other	3	0	Look, the volcano.	[]
Other	4	0	Quick, duck and cover.	[]
Other	1	0	Aaaaah!	[]
Other	7	0	That lava's coming right for us!!	[]
Chef	3	0	Oh no, look.	[]
Other	13	1	What the hell is this trench doing here?!? We can't get across!	['hell']
Other	17	0	It now looks as if the missing children are trapped in the path of hot, nasty lava.	[]
Other	18	0	God, please deliver those darling kids from... Wait, wait wait wait. 3,2, and 1. God, please deliv-	[]
Cartman	1	0	Help!	[]
Other	7	1	Jimminy Hope, it's the real Scuzzlebutt!	['scuzzlebutt']
Cartman	4	1	What?! Scuzzlebutt's real?!	['scuzzlebutt']
Kyle	7	0	Oh my God! Look at his leg!	[]
Other	8	0	Hi kids, I'm TV's Patrick Duffy.	[]
Other	4	0	Quick Ned, shoot it!	[]
Other	5	0	Mmmoh no, out of ammo.	[]
Other	1	0	Grrrr.	[]
Other	4	0	What... is that thing?	[]
Chef	3	1	That's Scuzzlebutt.	['scuzzlebutt']
Mr. Garrison	11	0	Yeah, he has Patrick Duffy for a leg, and weaves baskets.	[]
Other	12	0	This isn't happening. Everyone look away please. Nothing to see here.	[]
Other	10	0	Well boys, I'm sorry I got you all killed.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Aaaaah!	[]
Stan	6	0	Whoa, he built a wicker basket	[]
Other	5	0	Hey, he's saving us.	[]
Other	1	0	Grrr.	[]
Other	4	1	Scuzzlebutt saved the day.	['scuzzlebutt']
Randy	13	0	And my calculations worked: the lava is following the trench into the canyon.	[]
Other	7	0	Hmmm. Where exactly does the canyon go?	[]
Randy	1	0	Uhh...	[]
Other	1	0	Aaaaah.	[]
Mr. Garrison	4	0	South Park is saved.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Hey look, Kenny's okay.	[]
Kenny	4	0	(Hey guys, come here.)	[]
Other	36	0	And now these humble people can rejoice and celebrate their jovial victory over nature. I'm getting word that the chef of the school cafeteria wants to sing a song about this thrilling struggle of humanity.	[]
Chef	35	0	Mmmm Baby, every time that we kiss Hot Lava! Every time that we make love, hot lava Hot Lava! Lava so hot it makes me sweat Lava so warm and red and wet Lava! Brrrrrrrrrrrr.	[]
Other	11	0	Mayor, what do you have to say about this wonderful outcome?	[]
Other	13	1	Well, we owe everything to this friendly, yet misunderstood creature. Thank you Scuzzlebutt.	['scuzzlebutt']
Other	1	0	Friend.	[]
Other	3	0	Oh, how sweet.	[]
Stan	10	0	I did it, I did it, I finally killed something.	[]
Other	7	0	Oh my God! What has he done?	[]
Other	4	0	Turn off the cameras!	[]
Stan	4	0	Hey, that was easy!	[]
Other	4	0	Noooo! Why God? Why?!	[]
Other	9	1	Damn it Stan, you shouldn't have done that!	['damn']
Stan	2	0	What?! Why?!	[]
Kyle	6	0	Yeah, make up your mind, dude!	[]
Other	12	0	Stan, some things you kill, and some things you don't. See?	[]
Stan	1	0	No.	[]
Other	23	0	Moh, only now in this late hour do I see the folly of guns. Mmm, I'll never use a gun again, mmm.	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Oh, no!)	[]
Stan	15	0	But I just wanted you to be proud of me, like you were with Kenny.	[]
Other	24	0	But Kenny's dead now, Stan, and you're always going to be my nephew. And you can't just kill anything. You understand?	[]
Kyle	8	0	Dude, I don't understand hunting at all.	[]
Stan	9	0	Yeah,  it's stupid. Let's go watch cartoons.	[]
Cartman	4	1	Yeah, cartoons kick ass!	['ass']
