Cartman	6	0	Mom? Mommy? Where's my mommy?	[]
Other	9	0	Oh dear, did you lose your mother, little boy?	[]
Cartman	1	0	MOM!	[]
Other	1	0	Security?	[]
Other	1	0	Heaah?	[]
Other	6	0	This little boy lost his mom.	[]
Cartman	14	0	She said to wait for her by the... plastic boxes if I got lost.	[]
Other	6	0	It's all right, come on.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Mom? Where's my mom?	[]
Other	9	0	Oh dear. Did you lose your mommy, little boy?	[]
Other	7	1	Would you like some warm nuts, sir?	['nuts']
Cartman	4	1	Warm nuts, she said.	['nuts']
Cartman	5	0	Mom?! I lost my Mooohhm!	[]
Other	5	2	Warm nuts, sir? Warm nuts?	['nuts', 'nuts']
Cartman	5	0	No way dude. No way.	[]
Cartman	7	0	MOOOM! I can't find my mooom!	[]
Other	6	1	Would you like warm nuts, sir?	['nuts']
Cartman	7	0	Ahaha, okay okay it's getting old.	[]
Cartman	2	0	MOOOMMM! MOOOMMM!	[]
Other	16	0	The people have spoken, and the President of the United States is once again, Barack Obama.	[]
Other	18	0	I assure you all, I am heading back to the White House more motivated - more titillated - than ever.	[]
Kyle	24	0	Don't be sad, Ike. Just be happy that you live in a country where people get to elect a president at all.  Hello?	[]
Cartman	5	0	Hey Kyle. What's up?	[]
Kyle	5	0	Nothing, watching the election results.	[]
Cartman	49	0	Yeah, I figured. It's the day after the election, so you're probably sitting on the couch telling your little brother how great it is to live in a democratic society.  Listen, Kyle, could you come over for a second? I got somethin' I need to show you.	[]
Kyle	1	0	What?!	[]
Cartman	7	0	Please, Kyle. It's kind of important.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Alright, what is this all about, fatass?!	[]
Cartman	9	0	You happy with the election results last night, Kyle?	[]
Kyle	17	0	It doesn't matter if I am or not. People voted and I stand behind the president.	[]
Cartman	30	0	Oh, that's such a democratic thing to say, Kyle. What if I were to tell you that I have something in my room that could change the entire election?	[]
Kyle	3	0	Sure you do!	[]
Cartman	5	0	What if I did, Kyle?	[]
Kyle	17	0	Chr, what could you possibly have in your room that could change the outcome of the election?	[]
Cartman	3	0	Pretty sweet, huh?	[]
Kyle	5	1	What the hell is this?	['hell']
Cartman	15	0	What's it look like? Hundreds of thousands of votes from all the swing states.	[]
Kyle	5	0	I don't believe it.	[]
Cartman	15	0	No, really. There are states full of swingers. Bunch of perverts if you ask me.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Why do you have these?	[]
Cartman	43	0	Funny how voting works in this country, isn't it, Kyle.  Each one of these, a person. Someone who actually took the time to get themselves informed. Actually got up and drove to a voting area to make sure their voice was heard.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Dude!	[]
Cartman	21	0	Here's another patriotic American. He probably spent hours listening to all those presidential ads and tuned in to every debate.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Knock it off, Cartman!	[]
Cartman	21	0	Now, believe it or not, Kyle, I actually need your help. But first you have to promise not to tell anyone.	[]
Kyle	10	2	You're not getting away with this, you fat turd!	['fat', 'turd']
Cartman	11	0	Run now, little firefly. It's all part of the plan.	[]
Other	13	0	Sweetie, there's a Mr. Pun Li Tsiao on the phone for you?	[]
Cartman	25	0	Thanks Mom,  I'll take that in the study. Do I have a study? I don't think I have a study. That's fine.	[]
Other	2	0	Mr. President?	[]
Other	1	0	Yes?	[]
Other	11	0	Line 2 from China for you, sir. It's General Tso.	[]
Other	3	0	Yes, hello General.	[]
Other	9	0	We assume you are preased with the erection results?	[]
Other	7	0	Very pleased. Thank you for your help.	[]
Other	13	0	And you no doubt will now begin filling your side of the bargain.	[]
Other	13	0	You'll have what you want. I'll meet you in three hours.	[]
Other	21	0	Sir, the election may have gone the way they said, but we can't possibly give the Chinese what you promised.	[]
Other	20	0	I don't know how they did it, but the Chinese secured my victory. I have to fulfill my obligation.	[]
Other	17	0	And what if General Tso suddenly gets the courage to go to the press with all this?	[]
Other	9	0	Don't worry. Everyone knows General Tso's chicken.	[]
Other	13	0	Eric Cartman? We have a report you might be involved in voter fraud?	[]
Cartman	2	0	Hmmm, no.	[]
Other	7	0	You mind if we search your room?	[]
Cartman	27	0	I'm sorry, but I know my rights. You can't search my room without a warrant. And I'm afraid I can't give you permission.	[]
Kyle	20	0	This isn't a joke, Cartman! You have to believe me, officer. The outcome of the election depends on it.	[]
Other	4	0	Let's just see.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Ey! You can't do that! Ey!	[]
Kyle	6	0	Upstairs! First door to the left!	[]
Cartman	7	0	I know my rights! Stop right now!	[]
Kyle	19	0	But... they were here. Ah I swear it. Stacks and stacks of ballots from states all over the country!	[]
Cartman	49	0	I was always told that... we lived in a country based on freedom. That the one thing that made America different was that government could never barge into our lives unwarranted. But it's all changing, isn't it? Ever since Obama was first elected, it's all changing.	[]
Other	7	0	Oh my God, what have we done?	[]
Other	14	0	Guess this country is changing. We're sorry little boy, we're SO sorry.	[]
Kyle	23	0	Please you've, you've got to believe me! They've still gotta be here somewhere! Uh we've got to find them!	[]
Cartman	24	0	But where could they be? Where? And why would I care so much about the election results? So may questions, Kyle. So... little time.	[]
Kyle	22	0	Guys! You guys!  Listen: Cartman has tens of thousands of voter ballots hidden somewhere. He's changed the outcome of the election!	[]
Stan	6	0	Wow, really? That's pretty impressive.	[]
Kyle	14	0	Come on guys! He's hidden them somewhere and we have to find them!	[]
Stan	9	0	But I thought Obama won pretty easily last night.	[]
Kyle	14	0	Dude, because of the electoral college these votes in swing states can really matter.	[]
Stan	17	0	I don't understand that stuff at all. I need Morgan Freeman to explain it to me.	[]
Other	8	0	Yeah, I love when Morgan Freeman explains stuff.	[]
Craig	28	0	Whenever I'm confused about what's going on in a movie, I'm always so relieved when Morgan Freeman shows up and explains the plot to me.	[]
Kyle	13	1	God damn it this is serious, you guys! Cartman has stolen the election!	['damn']
Butters	7	0	Well, mmmaybe Cartman had a good reason.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Butters, you know something, don't you?!	[]
Butters	5	0	Huh? Wha? NO. Uhuh, why?	[]
Kyle	5	0	What did Cartman tell you?!	[]
Butters	33	0	He didn't tell me nothin'. Annd I'm sworn to secrecy. Ih-it's really important, Kyle, and it isn't what you think.  Uh, don't make me say any more!	[]
Kyle	7	0	Tell us what you know right now!	[]
Butters	18	0	I can't! Don't you see?!  Don't make me swallow this! Wa-I'll do it	[]
Stan	5	0	Is that an M&M?	[]
Butters	18	0	It's an almond M&M. Ah-I'm very allergic to almonds. Heey, just leave me alone.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Then you have to tell us!	[]
Butters	3	0	Well... hah... HWAAAH!	[]
Kyle	8	1	Oh shit! Don't let him swallow it!	['shit']
Stan	4	0	Pry his mouth open!	[]
Craig	3	0	He ate it!	[]
Stan	10	0	Butters, where are the ballots going?! Where are they going?!	[]
Butters	5	0	Ah! Bah! I hate almonds.	[]
Other	4	0	More melted butter, sir?	[]
Cartman	3	0	Mm, mhm, mhm.	[]
Other	16	0	Little boy, the President is on his way to pick up the ballots. Where are they?!	[]
Cartman	18	0	They're nearby. Very safe and sound. I just might want to... alter our deal a little bit.	[]
Other	13	0	Alter our... The President will be here in moments with what we want!	[]
Cartman	12	0	Yes. Tell me again exactly what you plan on doing with it?	[]
Other	7	0	Oh my God, it's the President!	[]
Other	27	0	Thank you, thank you all for your votes of confidence. If I could... just be a little rude and ask for a nice quiet meal in private?	[]
Other	15	0	Oh, of course. Come on, let's let the President have some peace and quiet.	[]
Other	15	0	Wow, the President eats at Red Lobster. He's just a normal guy like me.	[]
Other	7	0	Come on guys. President says get out.	[]
Other	7	0	I didn't actually vote for him.	[]
Other	6	0	All right. Where are the ballots?	[]
Other	8	0	Your friend has had a severe allergic reaction.	[]
Kyle	9	0	Can we please just try and talk to him?	[]
Other	8	0	All right, but don't take too long.	[]
Butters	4	0	What's up fellas?	[]
Kyle	11	0	Butters, you have to tell us what Cartman is up to!	[]
Butters	2	1	Bleh, ogayedmi.	['ogayedmi']
Kyle	29	0	I didn't wanna have to do this.  but if you don't tell us, I'm gonna tell your dad you helped get the wrong person elected President!	[]
Butters	6	0	AGH! No! Please! You can't!	[]
Kyle	9	0	Then just tell me what Cartman is up to!	[]
Butters	8	0	Okay! Okay! He's helping Oblamew pablama beblab.	[]
Stan	21	0	What'd he say?  Oh. Well what do you mean the election isn't the biggest thing that happened this week?	[]
Kyle	17	0	What?  You mean the missile defense program?!  Butters, where's Cartman supposed to hand over the ballots?!	[]
Butters	3	0	At Red Robster.	[]
Kenny	3	0	(At Red Lobster.)	[]
Kyle	1	0	Where?	[]
Butters	2	0	Red Lobster!	[]
Stan	1	0	Huh?	[]
Other	9	0	He said at Ruh ruh rruh ruh Reh Red	[]
Butters	2	0	Red Lobster!	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Red Lobster!)	[]
Kyle	1	0	What?	[]
Other	3	0	Ruh Rehh... Red	[]
Butters	2	0	Red Lobster!	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Red Lobster!)	[]
Stan	3	0	Oh, Red Lobster.	[]
Other	10	0	General Tso, do you have the missing ballots or not?	[]
Other	16	0	Sssure, we have the ballots, but we don't have them right here with us now.	[]
Other	17	1	Okay, you want me to come in again, we can start over, what the fuck is this?!	['fuck']
Kyle	9	0	All right, where are the missing ballots?!  President Obama?	[]
Cartman	14	1	Oh God damn it Kyle, I was just about to get what I wanted.	['damn']
Other	22	0	Mr. President, we got you reelected! Now you will give us the Star Wars technology so that we can make the sequels!	[]
Other	29	0	I told you China would get the rights to Star Wars from Disney as long as my Presidency was secure!  Until I have those ballots  it is not secure!	[]
Kyle	17	1	Wait a minute, the rights to Star Wars, the movies? What the hell is going on here?!	['hell']
Other	27	0	What's going on is the sale of America's greatest asset.  You see, when the United States created Star Wars it made this country incredibly powerful.	[]
Other	2	0	Morgan Freeman?	[]
Other	45	0	Earlier this week, Lucas signed the rights to Star Wars over to Disney, and the Chinese saw a way to obtain it for themselves. The Chinese government knew that President Obama would help them take the rights from Disney if they helped him get reelected.	[]
Craig	1	0	Ohhhh.	[]
Other	39	0	But the child who actually stole the ballots has hidden them, and won't give them to anyone until his demands are met. You've all got quite a mess on your hands. I wish you well with it.	[]
Stan	17	0	Hey just one thing, Morgan Freeman:  How come every time something convoluted needs explaining, you show up?	[]
Other	13	0	Because every time I show up and explain something, I earn a freckle.	[]
Cartman	28	0	So here's the deal, General Tso, Mr. President, when the Chinese make the sequels, I get to play the part of Luke Skywalker's son. Cartman Skywalker.	[]
Other	13	0	That was not the deal! We will not be a-bullied by you!	[]
Cartman	15	0	Well then, I guess we're about to play a game of Chicken, General Tso.	[]
Other	10	0	Heheh, I get it. General Tso's chih-chih-chicken.	[]
Other	6	0	You are absolutely sure about this?	[]
Other	13	0	It's been confirmed, Mike. My God, we might have won this thing.	[]
Other	25	0	Sir? Sir, we have some... incredible news. There are rumors of hundreds of thousands of stolen ballots. You might have won the election after all.	[]
Stan	5	0	There's nothing here, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Anything in the basement, Jimmy?	[]
Other	12	1	Just old junk, and boxes of Eric's mom's d-dildos	['dildos']
Kyle	3	0	Well keep looking.	[]
Other	7	0	Oh my goodness, what's going on?	[]
Kyle	15	0	Sorry Ms. Cartman, but your son took some things that didn't belong to him.	[]
Other	14	0	Oh, I've told him to respect people's property. What did he take?	[]
Stan	15	0	He stole ballots in all the swing states so the wrong person was elected President.	[]
Other	10	0	Oh well, no TV for him for a few days.	[]
Other	12	0	There's nothing here, Kyle. Not even one s-s-scooby clue.	[]
Stan	13	0	Oh my God you guys, look!  Dude, it's Boba Fett's ship!	[]
Other	9	1	Just what the Dickens is going on here, haha?!	['dickens']
Stan	6	1	Aw shit, it's him again.	['shit']
Other	37	2	What's this about a deal with the Chinese?! I own all this shit now! I own the Death Star! I own Tatooine! It's all MINE, haha! All right fuckers, where are the missing ballots? Haha.	['shit', 'fuckers']
Cartman	12	0	Butters.  You just couldn't keep your mouth shut, could you Butters?	[]
Butters	7	0	I didn't say anything. I promise.	[]
Cartman	25	0	I guess we learned that when it comes to Star Wars, we can't trust anyone. Not the President, not the Chinese, and not you.	[]
Butters	9	0	Please, Eric! I tried to be quiet, I swear!	[]
Cartman	31	0	Shhh, it's okay, Butters.  Nobody's gonna find the election ballots.  I have them hidden away somewhere... nobody would ever look.  A place in town people barely even know exists.	[]
Other	61	0	Hey guys. Lookin' to buy a Hummer today?  We're havin' a Rocktober sales event day that's goin' into Rockvember.  Hey there! Interested in test-drivin' a Hummer today?  I can see you, with the Ray-Bans, got that nice bicep haning' out the window rolled down, whattaya think?  Rockvember sales event, guys! Every Hummer comes with a free Segway.	[]
Other	7	0	Hey why don't you shut up?!	[]
Other	11	0	I'm just excited about all these deals, that's all.	[]
Other	12	0	We found him sir, but still no sign of the missing ballots.	[]
Other	28	0	Go on! Leave us alone! Haha.  Now listen, little boy, the reason this country works is because people go out to vote. Every vote counts. And you need-	[]
Cartman	20	1	Cut the crap, Mouse! You only care about the election results because Romney would have been tougher on the Chinese!	['crap']
Other	22	0	Why don't you just tell me where the missing ballots are?! It will make your death a lot less painful! Haha.	[]
Cartman	29	0	Trust me: they're somewhere nobody will ever find them! If you kill me, then Obama will stay President and you will lose Star Wars to the Chinese forever!	[]
Other	10	0	Pretty neat, huh? How would you like to have one?	[]
Cartman	22	0	I can get those at K-Mart! If you want me to switch sides, you'll have to do better than that!	[]
Other	2	0	Like what?!	[]
Cartman	8	0	I want a part in the new movies!	[]
Other	28	0	Well then, why didn't you just come to me in the first place? If you wanna be in the next Star Wars, I'm your guy! Haha.	[]
Cartman	17	1	I get to be Luke Skeywalker's son. And there has to be a character called Jewbacca.	['jewbacca']
Other	22	1	You can be Luke's son, you can be Han Solo's son, I don't give two shits and a popsicle.	['shits']
Cartman	40	0	Really? Well then, I suppose that making the votes public IS the right thing to do. I can get the ballots for you. But if I'm gonna smuggle them here, I'm gonna need a blaster and a tauntaun.	[]
Other	11	1	Sure thing. I've got tauntauns comin' out my asshole, haha.	['asshole']
Cartman	1	0	Haha.	[]
Other	1	0	Haha.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Haha.	[]
Other	29	0	This is Breaking Election News. Hold that phone! The election may be over, but rumors are running rampant that hundreds of thousands of ballots for Mitt Romney were stolen!	[]
Kyle	26	0	We need everyone's help here. What you're looking for are big boxes of ballots. Hundreds of them. Please check your basement, your attic, and-	[]
Other	27	0	And and you claim that a General Tso hired your friend, Fatass, to steal the ballots, but so far the Chinese are refusing to speak with us.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Yeah, probably 'cause General Tso's chicken.	[]
Other	9	0	Is that it? Did he just? Did he just?	[]
Other	11	0	Yup. Chris, we're getting confirmation that was the millionth time.	[]
Other	24	0	Excitement and revelry at South Park as a little boy has just made the General Tso's chicken joke for the one millionth time.	[]
Kyle	1	0	What?	[]
Other	23	0	Little boy, the General Tso's chicken joke, a favorite for years, you've just hit the magic number, how does it feel?	[]
Kyle	2	0	I... what?	[]
Other	32	0	He's being presented with the check now, a five thousand dollar gift certificate to P.F. Chang's.  This has been a long campaign, but someone's finally done it, Wolf.	[]
Stan	4	0	Well, we tried, dude.	[]
Kyle	20	0	It just seems so unfair. People won't ever even know that the wrong man is in the White House.	[]
Stan	37	0	Well, I mean, look at it this way: Almost half the country did actually vote for Obama. If the election really just came down to a bunch of boxes Cartman stole, then, does it matter that much?	[]
Kyle	6	0	It matters, Stan. It it matters.	[]
Other	42	3	Ho ho ho hoo!  Come on down to Stevenson Hummer for our big Christmas in Humvember Sale!  Not sure what to get your loved one this holiday season? Why not give them a nice Hummer? Nothing beats a Hummer on Christmas morning!	['ho', 'ho', 'ho']
Stan	12	0	Stan, when was the last time you saw somebody drive a Hummer?	[]
Stan	5	0	Uhhh, forever ago, like, 2010?	[]
Kyle	3	0	Oh my God.	[]
Other	21	0	Hey, looking for a Hummer today? Got some 2009s here. Never been driven. ...Ever.  Go on, get out of here! Shoo!	[]
Kyle	4	0	Look! There they are!	[]
Other	14	0	Hey, hi there! You kids like Hummers, huh? Let me show you these babies!	[]
Kyle	10	0	We found it, you guys!  Oh no, they followed us!	[]
Other	6	1	Oh hell yes! Asians! Hey guys!	['hell']
Other	5	0	Get out of our way!	[]
Kyle	12	0	No! These don't belong to you! They belong to the people!	[]
Other	11	0	I am tired of playing games! This little farce is ovah!	[]
Cartman	10	0	I don't think so, General Tso! This way, officers!	[]
Other	8	0	Oh my God it's a sales rush!	[]
Other	10	0	Oh my God. Are those what I think they are?	[]
Cartman	14	0	Yes, we must show these to the public! For democracy's sake, right Kyle?	[]
Other	13	0	Sir, we've found something, at the Hummer sales lot outside of town.	[]
Other	15	0	You don't understand. We are trying to protect the greatest film series ever made!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Protect it?	[]
Other	7	1	What the hell is going on here?!	['hell']
Other	47	0	Perhaps I can explain it to you.  You see, it turns out the only reason the Chinese so desperately wanted Star Wars is because they're afraid that Disney might not be the right place for it. The Chinese simply want to guard Star Wars' impeccable legacy.	[]
Other	4	0	Is that Morgan Freeman?	[]
Other	71	0	And now we're at a crossroads. If these ballots are made public, then the man the people voted for will be President, but he will no doubt keep Star Wars from the Chinese, and allow Disney to keep it instead. And so we have to ask ourselves, What's more important? That the right man is elected President, or that Star Wars is with people who will protect it most?	[]
Other	6	0	Unit 4, what is it?! Over.	[]
Other	2	0	Well kid?	[]
Kyle	7	0	Well... if you put it that way...	[]
Other	8	0	Come in Unite 4! What have you found?!	[]
Other	17	0	Nothing sir. We just found some tremendous deals on cars nobody wants, that's all. Barkley out.	[]
Cartman	12	0	No! But Obama wasn't really elected! Don't you people care?!	[]
Other	4	0	Obama is President again.	[]
