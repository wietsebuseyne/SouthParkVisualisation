Cartman	9	0	No there aren't. Jesus, grow up, you guys.	[]
Other	10	0	Oh my God. Oh my God!  Steven! Steven, come quick!	[]
Other	4	0	What is it, Martha?	[]
Other	8	0	Look. It's him! It's... our son.	[]
Other	2	0	Our ssson!	[]
Other	25	0	...and so that's when I called out to my husband. I just knew the boy picture on your milk carton was our little Tommy.	[]
Other	16	0	... yes, I see.  Uh, but the child on the milk carton was reported missing, not found.	[]
Other	39	0	We realize that. But we just thought that maybe someone else had found Tommy, and then lost him again. We're pretty certain that it's our boy, considering his physical appearance. Martha and I have the... same condition.	[]
Other	1	0	...Riiight.	[]
Other	16	1	You may not have realized this, but we actually have buttocks where our heads should be.	['buttocks']
Other	1	0	...Really?	[]
Other	1	0	Yes.	[]
Other	20	0	Steven and I have a condition called torsonic polarity syndrome. It's a birth defect that's passed on genetically.	[]
Other	7	0	Over eleven people worldwide suffer from TPS.	[]
Other	8	0	Hmm, hmm, that's am-, that's amazing.	[]
Other	16	0	Martha and I were lucky enough to meet each other at a TPS convention in France.	[]
Other	12	0	So... do you have heads down where your rear ends should be?	[]
Other	32	0	No no, don't be silly. You see, with TPS, the birth defect is on the exterior only. Behind this we still have all our vital head organs - tongue, eyes, nasal passages...	[]
Other	4	0	Well, Mr. and Mrs...	[]
Other	2	0	Uh, Thompssson.	[]
Other	21	0	...Thompson. Uh, I'll contact the young boy who gave me the photo, and perhaps we can all visit him together.	[]
Other	10	0	Oh, wonderful! Steven, we're goin' to see Tommy again!	[]
Other	11	0	Now, Martha, what did I say about getting our hopesss up?	[]
Other	6	0	You're right. You're right.	[]
Kyle	8	0	...Okay Cartman, what do you want this time?	[]
Cartman	48	0	Oho, you guys, you guys! Oh my God.  Okay, okay, so get this, get this: The milk company calls me, right?  And they call me and say that two people from Wisconsin... saw the picture of Kenny on the milk carton, and they think it's their kid.	[]
Stan	11	0	...Dude, that's not funny if they're missing their son.	[]
Cartman	20	1	No, nonono! Because apparently these two people... also kind of look like they have butts where their heads should be!	['butts']
Kyle	2	0	...Nuh uh.	[]
Cartman	55	0	Oh yes! And the best part is... they're coming here, to my house. And it's gonna be sooo funny!!  Oh Jesus, that's probably them now! Okay, you guys, just play it cool, just play it-, just-sshh. No, sshh, you guys, sshh.  Just- okay  No.  Okay, okay, no, you guys, sh, sh.	[]

Other	10	0	Uh, excuse me, boys, do you know anything about this?	[]
Kyle	1	0	Uh	[]
Stan	2	0	Oh boy.	[]
Kyle	18	0	Eh-heh. L-look, if you want an explanation, you you'd better go to Kenny's house.	[]
Stan	13	0	Yeah. He lives about four houses away in the bad side of town.	[]
Other	5	0	Oh thank you. Thank you!	[]
Other	1	0	Well?	[]
Other	7	0	They said to inquire four houses down.	[]
Other	3	0	Let's hurry!	[]
Kyle	8	1	Ehheh, Cartman, what the hell are you doing?	['hell']
Stan	6	0	Yeah, you missed them turning around.	[]
Cartman	5	0	You guys, something's wrong.	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Cartman	20	0	I think... I.. just.. saw the funniest thing I'll ever see. And I... think... I... blew a funny fuse.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Blew a funny fuse?	[]
Cartman	27	0	It was just too much and my sense of humor overloaded.  I don't think anything will ever be funny again. Oh God. What have I got?	[]
Clyde	9	1	You mean they both have butts instead of heads?	['butts']
Stan	12	0	Yeah, dude, we'll show you. They're over at Kenny's.	[]
Token	4	0	How do they eat?	[]
Stan	6	1	How the hell should we know?	['hell']
Kyle	9	0	Butters! Hey Butters! You have to check this out!	[]
Butters	2	0	W-what?	[]
Kyle	9	0	You gotta come to Kenny's house with us.	[]
Stan	12	0	There's these two people with asses where their heads should be.	[]
Butters	16	0	Ahah-I can't, fellas. Ah-I'm grounded for lookin' stupid in my school picture.	[]
Stan	9	0	But dude, you gotta see it; it's hysterical!	[]
Other	28	1	Butters can't come out and play, boys. He thinks it's funny to look like a jackass in his school pictures that I have to pay for!	['jackass']
Butters	20	1	Huh, but I told you mom: ah-I didn't mean to look... like a jackass, eh. It just happened.	['jackass']
Other	5	0	You made a goofy face!	[]
Butters	9	0	No! That's just what I look like. See?	[]
Other	10	0	...Don't you make that face at me, young man!	[]
Butters	7	0	I'm not makin' a face, mom!	[]
Other	2	0	Stop it!	[]
Craig	8	1	...Come on, we wanna see the ass people.	['ass']
Kyle	1	0	Alright.	[]
Other	24	0	Fine Butters! If you don't wanna stop making that stupid face at me, you can just stay in your room for another week!	[]
Butters	7	0	Another week?  I hate my stupid face.	[]
Mr. Mackey	17	0	Okay Eric, as your counselor, uh I want you to feel comfortable talking about anything, m'kay?	[]
Cartman	20	0	Mr. Mackey, is it possible that you can see something so funny that it ruins your sense of humor forever?	[]
Mr. Mackey	12	0	Well, I can't think of anything that would be THAT funny.	[]
Cartman	17	0	Two people with asses for heads. Ever since I saw them I can't laugh at anything.	[]
Mr. Mackey	13	0	Oh, I see, well... Well, what did you used to think was funny?	[]
Cartman	47	0	You know, all the usual stuff. Dirty jokes, funny movies, seeing someone die...  This morning, I even saw a little girl get her fingers caught in a car door and... I couldn't laugh. I mean I... I knew it was funny, but I couldn't laugh.	[]
Mr. Mackey	37	0	Well Eric, I suppose that, just like everything else, laughter can be relative - in, in other words, sometimes people see somethin' so scary that nothin' else scares them, so, the same could be true for funny things.	[]
Cartman	9	0	So does that mean I'll never laugh again?	[]
Mr. Mackey	29	0	It's possible, hm'kay?  But you know, if you have completely lost your sense of humor, you can always become a writer for the show, Friends . Ohokahay, huhuh.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Ugh.	[]
Other	21	1	...and so you see, our son was just playing a joke and the little fat kid put it on the carton.	['fat']
Other	4	0	Yes. Yes, I see.	[]
Other	11	0	Kenny, don't you think you owe the Thompsons an apology?	[]
Other	11	0	...No, it was foolish for us to get our hopes up.	[]
Other	26	1	It was just such a coincidence, considering the photo. You may not have realized this, but Martha and I have buttocks where our heads should be.	['buttocks']
Other	1	0	Really?	[]
Other	15	0	Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, how long has it been since you've seen your son?	[]
Other	7	0	Tommy disappeared when he was only seven.	[]
Other	12	0	Oh, Steven, it's like it's all happening all over again.	[]
Other	3	0	There there now.	[]
Other	36	0	Please, Mrs. Thompson, it'll be alright.  Listen, the South Park Dairy Company is the country's largest. We find lost children all the time.  We can help you find Tommy with the company's database!	[]
Other	21	0	Yes, well, aaah-I'll help you find your son. Just stop cryin', Please, for the love of God, stop cryin'!	[]
Other	8	0	Ah, agh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.	[]
Other	11	0	Mr. Thompson, how did your son become missing? Was he abducted?	[]
Other	12	0	Yes. He was in the care of our nanny at the time.	[]
Other	28	0	The nanny that we trusted so much took off with him and we still don't know why.  We think perhaps she wanted a child of her own.	[]
Other	6	0	And this was back in Wisconsin?	[]
Other	18	0	Yes, but we last heard the nanny was heading west.  That's why we thought Colorado made sssssense.	[]
Other	16	0	We've tried every avenue to find him,  but, we've never tried the milk company.	[]
Other	40	0	Well you just give us a try. I think you'll find that South Park Milk  is not only the best resource for finding kids,  but also the best producer of the freshest 2% lowfat milk the world can offer.	[]
Other	9	0	Thank you. Thank you so much for helping us.	[]
Other	12	0	This certainly is a friendly town.  You've all been sssssso wonderful.	[]
Other	10	0	Yes, I'm so grateful I just wanna cry again.	[]
Other	1	0	NO!	[]
Other	8	0	Dude, why are you wearing Shalayna's panties?	[]
Other	21	0	I have to wear Shalayna's panties. Lisa's were in the wash.  Look, can we just get this over with?	[]
Other	12	0	But dude, I can't French-kiss him. He's my grandpa!	[]
Other	3	0	Come on, dude.	[]
Other	8	0	Oh, alright  Here it goes. Come'ere, Grandpa.	[]
Other	1	0	Aww	[]
Cartman	3	0	Oh, dude, oh.	[]
Other	6	0	Dude, what's wrong with you?	[]
Cartman	6	0	Nothing's wrong with me. Uh-	[]
Other	23	0	Well, I'm glad that's over with. We'd better go back to the house now to see how Chris is doing.	[]
Other	27	0	Uh Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, as President of the South Park Milk Company, I want to apologize personally for printing that falsified picture on our milk cartons.	[]
Other	7	0	Please, please. It's not your fault.	[]
Other	68	1	Ye-yes, but here at South Park Milk we strive for excellence. For instance, we are now entering the extraction room.  As you can see, we keep it close to the refrigeration room. That way we can get the milk to the container as fast as possible.  That's why some say South Park milk tastes like you're suckin' it right from the cow's tits yourself.	['tits']
Other	1	0	Amazing.	[]
Other	13	0	Here, try a glass of our cold Vitamin D. And our fresh scones.	[]
Other	1	0	Delicious.	[]
Other	11	0	Oh, excuse me. A little... difficult to drink with our condition.	[]
Other	11	1	Martha and I actually have buttocks where our heads should be.	['buttocks']
Other	12	0	Really? Well. And in here we have our Missing Child Resource Center.	[]
Other	6	0	Oh my, isn't this impressive?	[]
Other	18	0	Yes. With the Kelrom 4000, Mrs. Garthunk can search a database of over 30 million missing child cases.	[]
Other	17	0	We'll start the computer on a data search. Now, when did your son turn up missing?	[]
Other	11	0	Well, it was 1982. Tommy was only six at the time.	[]
Other	3	0	Alright then. Computer...	[]
Other	1	0	Workiiing.	[]
Other	15	0	Run a scan of missing children since 1982. Check for physical birth defects called TPS.	[]
Other	9	0	TPS. Torsonic Polarity Syndrome. Child missing since 1982. Workiiing.	[]
Other	12	0	So you actually haven't seen your son in over 20 years?	[]
Other	3	0	That's right.	[]
Other	20	0	But then, why did you think the picture of Kenny was him. Wouldn't your son be much older now?	[]
Other	22	0	Yes, but since he appeared to be at least eight in the photo,  we assumed someone had seen him since we did.	[]
Other	11	0	This is the only photo we have of our little Tommy.	[]
Other	18	0	It's gonna take quite a while for the computer to do a scan of all missing kids.	[]
Other	24	0	Well, why don't we let Mrs. Garthunk do her work, and I'll take you two out for some good old Colorado chili.	[]
Other	11	0	We don't really like chili; it makes us throw up.	[]
Other	12	0	Well, hello, Eric. I was really glad you called me, very much.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Jimmy! Thank God! Get in here!	[]
Other	5	0	What's this all about?	[]
Cartman	21	0	Jimmy, you've always been my favorite standup comic. You've gotta help me. I've lost my sense of humor.	[]
Other	16	0	Gee, that's a terrible thing, Eric. Um comedy can be the best therapy, very much.	[]
Cartman	15	0	I just have to find my funny bone again! Just try and make me laugh.	[]
Other	17	0	Oh, I don't think that'll be hard. I've been working on my rr... routine.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Okay, let me have it.	[]
Other	14	0	Okay. Try this one on for size: Why did the... pigeon cross the road?	[]
Cartman	2	0	Okay, why?	[]
Other	42	4	Because it was having sex with the chihi... Because it was having sex with the ch-hi-hi... Because it was having sex with the ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch...  eh, it was having sex with the ch-ch-hiicken.	['sex', 'sex', 'sex', 'sex']
Cartman	9	0	...Naw, see? Somethng's wrong. I'm not laughing.	[]

Other	2	0	Workiiing.  Negative.	[]
Other	14	0	Ugh. This is hopeless! ...Wait a minute, let's try it this way: Computer?	[]
Other	1	0	Workiiing.	[]
Other	9	0	Scan databanks for children who reported their parents missing.	[]
Other	6	0	Workiiing.  One million six thousand hits.	[]
Other	12	0	Alright, then break it down to claims in the past twenty years.	[]
Other	7	0	Workiiing.  Three hundred twenty-one thousand hits.	[]
Other	11	1	Alright, now run a scan on homogenized versus pasteurized skim milk.	['homogenized']
Other	12	1	In skim form, homogenized has longer shelf life by 2.3 weeks.	['homogenized']
Other	24	0	Okaaay, okay, now give me a breakdown of people who are seeking their parents who also suffer from a disease called T P S.	[]

Butters	31	0	Uh, my parents are makin' me wear this paper bag until I learn... to stop makin' silly faces all the time. They've really had it up to  here with me.	[]
Other	10	0	Butters? Are you ready to stop with the stupid faces?	[]
Butters	4	0	I sure am, Dad!	[]
Other	8	0	Alright, you can take the paper bag off.	[]
Butters	9	0	Thanks, Dad! Ah I'm sorry I was bad-	[]
Other	17	0	Oh, very funny, young man! You think it's clever to make yourself up like a girl?!	[]
Butters	8	0	Hububut Dad, ah I didn't lick a-	[]

Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, your son grew up not knowing who his parents were.  But he was strong and resilient,  and ended up becoming very successful. I think it will amaze you as it will all of us to learn that your son... is Ben Affleck!	[]

Kyle	31	0	When Cartman first opened the door, and saw the Thompsons, he felt bad for playing a joke on them. Now that everything's turned out alright, he's able to laugh.	[]
Stan	10	0	Oh, you're right. Cartman had a feeling of remorse.	[]
Cartman	10	0	E-heh. No no no, I blew a funny fuse.	[]
Kyle	13	0	There is no such thing as a funny fuse, Cartman. You felt bad.	[]
Cartman	23	0	Whatever. All I know is that I can laugh again. I'm gonna go home and eat another chocolate gun. Come on, Kenny!	[]
Other	1	0	Dangit!	[]
Stan	13	0	Wow, Cartman actually felt bad for somebody and couldn't laugh at them.	[]
Kyle	11	0	Our little man is growing up, Stan. He's growing up.	[]
