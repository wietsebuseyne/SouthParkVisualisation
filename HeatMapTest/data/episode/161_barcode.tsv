Cartman	6	0	Then the game is on, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	16	0	It's not a game, you derelict! And this isn't Scotch! It's apple juice!	[]

Butters	3	0	Uh hey Eric!	[]
Cartman	42	0	Butters, do you think it's possible that you can lose the ability to filter what you say? I mean, if somebody got used to saying whatever came to their mind, could they start saying things that they would normally never say?	[]
Butters	6	0	Wuh who are you talking about?	[]

Se we tracked him down to his hoouuse. And you know what he did? He shot himself.  It'd be a shame if... you didn't wanna go on Dateline. Be a shame if we had to track you down and you shot yourself.

You can't just walk around saying whatever you want. You gave us a filter because, people don't wanna hear things like I touched penises with my cousin!  Ahaab, ahaabuh. And, and I learned, you especially can't say whatever you want on national television, 'cause, there could be kids watching. Please, God, don't make me embarrass myself on national television.
