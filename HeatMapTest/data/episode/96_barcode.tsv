Other	16	0	a-a-aactually it looks like you're gonna owe Santa three hundred and six presents.	[]
Cartman	1	0	What?!	[]
Other	19	0	Four thousand three hundred and twelve instances of being naughty against three deductions of being nice, is, is bad.	[]
Cartman	15	0	Three?? You didn't deduct all my nice invoices! Look look! What about this one?	[]

Cartman	40	0	Haven't you seen the Haibo doll? It's like a pet, a robot pet. You have to feed it and pet it or else it dies, and it's the coolest thing ever! Santa has to bring me one!	[]
Other	19	0	But what, look, aren't there any other nice things you've done recently we can write off here?	[]
Cartman	8	0	Uh... Oh! I brushed my teeth last night!	[]

Cartman	12	0	I'm just letting you know how special you are to me.	[]
Other	60	0	But now, before we light the tree, I think we should all reflect for a moment on those who are less fortunate than us.

Cartman	10	0	Oh, heh. Are the uh tabulations all closed up then?	[]
Other	26	0	Oh no, they keep it open until midnight of Christmas Eve. Some kids actually try to cram in a lot of niceness right at the end.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Oh, that's so lame of them.	[]
Other	15	0	Santa, my friends are trying to do something very special this Christmas. Tell him, Eric.	[]
Cartman	44	0	Well Santa, it's just that... I was thinking about the people in Iraq who are afraid that we might bomb them and I just thought, well, maybe it wouldn't hurt to send them a little bit of our Christmas spirit as well.	[]
Other	27	0	You know you're right. Santa hasn't been to that of the world in a looong time. Perhaps Santa could bring peace to this whole situation.	[]
Cartman	5	0	That's what I thought.	[]
Other	15	0	Gnomes!  Load up the sleigh with toys! Santa's going to make a special run!	[]
Other	2	0	All right!	[]

Kyle	21	0	Is that what this is all about?!  You came up with this whole idea so you could get a stupid toy?!	[]
Cartman	24	0	It's not stupid! It's a toy that you can starve! If you don't feed it, it dies. It's sooo cool.	[]
Stan	23	1	Well good going, asshole! Thanks to you, there's not gonna be any Christmas, and there's no one left to help us!	['asshole']
