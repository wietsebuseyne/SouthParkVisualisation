Other	6	1	Oh, Terrance! You farted in court!	['farted']
Other	10	0	Yes, Phillip. I'm making a case for our defense.	[]
Other	73	0	All of these things link Terrance to the murder: hair fibers, blood samples, nail clippings, a piece of his shirt,  a watch with his initials on it, a day planner with the murder scheduled, a haiku called, Time to Kill Dr. Jeffrey O'Dwyer. Dr. O'Dwyer Time to have your head smashed in with my new hammer Terrance, you may be a famous surgeon, but you're not God! J'accuse, Terrance!	[]

Other	15	0	Yes. It's been a long day, and only Kraft dinner can calm my nerves.	[]
Other	17	0	Say, Phillip, why does Scott always try to convict me of murder? He does it every week.	[]
Other	16	0	He sure does seem to hate us. I wonder what he'll try to do next.	[]
Other	3	0	God only knows.	[]

Other	13	0	No it isn't.  Wanna see what's on the inside of me?	[]
Other	20	0	Wait wait. I've got an idea. Why don't you put this paper bag over your head, Ugly Bob?	[]

Other	17	0	Oh, Ugly Bob, I'm so confused. I love your personality, but you are so wretchedly ugly.	[]
Other	10	0	Maybe the baby will have your face instead of mine.	[]
Other	23	0	We can only hope. I suppose we'll be okay as long as you keep that bag on your head.  What's this?!	[]
Other	25	0	He-yy there. I'm Saddam Hussein. I'm a big fan of Polo. I've been searching a long time for you, Celine Dion.	[]
Other	9	1	Oh no, you don't. She's my bitch.	['bitch']
Other	4	0	Eh! Who are you?	[]
Other	20	0	I'm Bob. But my friends call me Ugly Bob, because I have the features of a deformed burn victim.	[]
Other	24	0	Really? I thought all Canadians looked alike. Let me see.  Well, I'm sorry, guy. You know, I could cure that face of yours.	[]
Other	2	0	You can?	[]
Other	38	0	Sure! I just need a favor. There is a Canadian football game tomorrow: the Ottawa Roughriders vs. the Vancouver Roughriders. It is at that game that I will officially turn the Canadian flag over to my Iranian one.	[]
Other	2	0	What?! Why?!	[]
Other	45	0	Hey! Don't worry about that. Take a load off, don't worry about it! Look over here! ...All I need is for Celine Dion to sing our Iranian national anthem at the game - to finalize my hostile takeover of Canada. What do you say?	[]
Other	7	0	Did you say, hostile takeover of Canada?	[]
Other	5	0	No, no, relax there, fella!	[]
Other	13	0	Well, Scott said to meet him here, but he's not showing up!	[]
Other	12	0	Well, while we're waiting, why don't we search for treasure?	[]
Other	8	0	Oh. Good idea. Let's search for treasure.	[]
Other	5	0	What are you idiots doing?!	[]
Other	5	0	We're looking for treasure!	[]
Other	16	0	Is that some kind of metaphor for a kind of search that can't be described?	[]
Other	6	0	No, we're searching for treasure.	[]
Other	19	0	Listen. I have an inside scoop. There's an Iraqi dictotor who is quietly and slowly taking over Canada.	[]
Other	11	0	Yes. You mean Saddam Smelly. We saw him on the telly.	[]
Other	9	0	Well, what are you two gonna do aboat it?	[]
Other	4	0	What do you mean?	[]
Other	24	0	It's your fault that he's here! You brought the Iraqis back with you on your plane when you rescued your kidnapped daughter!	[]
Other	6	0	You mean, we are to blame?!	[]
Other	39	0	That's right. And now you must make amends. Tomorrow, Saddam will try to finalize his takeover of Canada, at the Roughriders-Roughriders football game. It will be your only shot at wiping them all out. Here, take this.	[]
Other	3	0	What is this?	[]
Other	24	0	It's a bomb.  You must strap it to yourselves, go to the game, and sacrifice your lives to take out Saddam's minions.	[]
Other	4	0	That plan's scary!	[]
Other	7	0	Well, you must do it for Canada.	[]
Other	3	0	For Canada, Terrance.	[]
Other	3	0	For Canada, Phillip.	[]

Other	13	0	Well. Phillip, I am very sad that we have to die for Canada.	[]
Other	22	0	Yes. This bomb will blow us both to smithereens. But we really have no choice. Only our deaths can bring Canada life.	[]
Other	3	0	That's funny!	[]
Other	9	1	Hey! Wait a minute. That fart gives me pause.	['fart']
Other	3	0	Why is that?	[]
Other	13	0	That smelly Saddam Hussein. He uses germ and chemical warfare, does he not?	[]
Other	4	0	Yes. Apparently, he does.	[]
Other	12	0	Terrance! Get the phone book! We must call every Canadian we can!	[]
Other	9	0	Oh, Phillip. It sounds like you have an idea.	[]
Other	3	0	I do, Terrance.	[]
Other	56	0	And the Roughriders are giving the Roughriders a run for their money!  All else aside, I must say that the Roughriders  are simply outmatched by these Roughriders  And that's going to take us to halftime. Be sure to stick around for the halftime show: Saddam and the Electric Iraqis in a salute to hostile takeovers!	[]
Other	8	0	Well, I guess it's time, old friend.	[]
Other	4	0	Yes. Prepare the alert!	[]
Other	92	0	Hello to my Canadian friends. Everybody relax. Take a rest. Lift your feet up. Those Dogs Are Barking.  You may have noticed some changes to your country. Don't worry about that, the changes will continue. I'm here to announce once and for all that Canada will now be known as New Baghdad! Qoloh Qalah!  You will bow down to me as your ruler! You will obey my laws or you will be killed!!  And now you will sing the Iraqi national anthem!  Or you will be stabbed in the head!	[]
