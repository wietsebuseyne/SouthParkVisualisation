Other	37	0	This is shop class.  My name is Mr. Adler. For the next week, rather than your normal schoolwork, you'll be learning how to make things. Now, does anybody know WHY you're in shop class?  Yes?	[]
Stan	17	0	Because we had to choose between this and home ec, and we didn't wanna be sissies?	[]
Other	39	0	Wrong! You are here because you are America's future!  You may someday be doctors, or lawyers, or scientists. Most of you, however, will be pumping gas, or cutting sheet metal, and that's why we have...  shop class.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Ooooohh.	[]
Other	39	0	Now, let me make one thing crystal clear: I don't like kids that screw around! You screw around in shop class, you can lose a hand or an eye. I have a-  I have... uh, I have a...	[]
Kyle	2	0	Mr. Adler?	[]
Other	20	0	Huh? Oh, uh, I was just saying that I want to know who is the biggest troublemaker in your class?	[]
Stan	2	0	Tweek is!	[]
Other	5	0	Arrh! No, I'm not!	[]
Kyle	8	0	Yeah, you are! You always get in trouble	[]
Other	1	0	Arrrrh!	[]
Cartman	13	0	Oh, hello, excuse me, but Craig is the biggest troublemaker in our class.	[]
Other	6	0	That true, Craig? You a troublemaker?	[]
Craig	1	0	No.	[]
Other	18	0	Well, you'd better not be, because in shop class we-  Hey! Did you just flip me off?!	[]
Craig	1	0	No.	[]
Other	3	0	Yes, you did!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Told ya!	[]
Kyle	11	0	Dude, shop class sucks. Maybe we should have taken home ec.	[]
Stan	8	0	Now way, dude. Home ec is for girls.	[]
Other	25	0	Welcome to home ec.  For the next week, you will be learning how to bake, sew, clean, and make things that are lacy and pretty.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Woohooo!)	[]
Wendy	12	0	I requested to be in shop class, but they sent me here.	[]
Other	47	0	That's right, Wendy. You see, some of you girls will go on to have interesting jobs and careers.  But all of you pretty ones... won't have to worry about that, because you can marry a nice man. And that's why we have... home ec.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Woohooo!)	[]
Cartman	10	0	I wonder why Kenny didn't wanna take shop class?	[]
Stan	9	0	I don't know. He's such a wuss.	[]
Other	10	0	Hey! Don't screw around! You screw around too much!	[]
Cartman	16	0	You know, you guys are totally wrong about Tweek. Craig is way worse than he is.	[]
Stan	9	0	No he's not dude. Craig is a wuss.	[]
Cartman	15	1	Dude, if Craig and Tweek got in a fight, Craig would kick Tweek's ass.	['ass']
Kyle	4	0	Do you wanna bet?	[]
Cartman	4	0	Yeah, I'll bet.	[]
Stan	2	0	How much?	[]
Cartman	2	0	Five bucks.	[]
Stan	3	0	You're on!	[]
Other	1	0	Arrh!	[]
Stan	2	0	Hey Tweek.	[]
Other	1	0	Gaarhrhrh!	[]
Stan	8	0	Dude. Craig chooses you. He wants to fight.	[]
Other	2	0	He does?	[]
Stan	12	0	Yeah. He's all pissed off at you. So, will you fight?	[]
Other	1	0	Why?	[]
Kyle	14	0	Dude, because! You have to stand up for yourself! So will you fight him?	[]
Other	11	0	Rrrrh! He doesn't look like he wants to fight me.	[]
Cartman	45	1	Craig, could I talk to you real quick?  Er, just a second, please, Craig. Craig, I'm not normally one to get involved in this kind of thing but, well, I was just standing over by Tweek, and, he called you a big poop-eater.	['poop']
Craig	2	0	He did?	[]
Cartman	22	2	Yeah. He said you eat poop, and that it makes your breath smell like poop, and that, eh, well, you like it.	['poop', 'poop']
Craig	5	0	Why would he say that?	[]
Cartman	26	1	I don't Craig, I don't know. But now he's over there telling everybody that you're a poop-eater and he chooses you.	['poop']
Craig	8	0	Well, I've gotta go over there and-	[]
Cartman	37	0	No, no! Craig, you you can't fight him here; Mr. Adler would just break it up. Tell you what: I'll go tell him you accept his challenge, and set it up for after school today.	[]
Craig	1	0	Okay.	[]
Kyle	9	0	There. Did you see? He just flipped you off.	[]
Other	4	1	Rrrr! What a jerk!	['jerk']
Stan	9	0	He's really got it out for you, dude.	[]
Other	5	0	Why?! What did I do?!	[]
Kyle	9	0	So, do you agree to fight him after school?	[]
Other	3	0	I guess so.	[]
Stan	4	0	Super. See you there.	[]
Other	30	0	Catch me, Richard.  I'm so in love with you, Richard.  I made you some cookies, Richard.  Merry Christmas, Richard.  Oh, Richard. Say you'll hold me forever.  Aaaaaaa!  Richard!	[]
Other	5	0	Aaaarr! Uh.  Oh why? Why?	[]
Stan	5	0	Mr. Adler! Mr. Ad-ler!	[]
Other	5	0	Huhuh Huh? Stop screwing around!	[]
Stan	6	0	The bell rang. Can we go?	[]
Other	7	0	Well, uh, well, sure. Uh, class dismissed.	[]
Stan	4	0	Come on, you guys.	[]
Stan	7	0	This is gonna be so sweet, dude.	[]
Cartman	14	1	You guys are so wrong about Tweek. He's gonna get his ass kicked.	['ass']
Kyle	3	0	We'll see!	[]
Cartman	11	0	Why don't we just raise our bet to ten dollars?!	[]
Stan	4	0	You're on, fatass!	[]
Cartman	13	0	Well, well, well, look who's here! Our little home economics friend, Kenny!	[]
Kenny	8	0	(Hey guys, what's going on with you?)	[]
Stan	8	0	How come you wanna take home ec., Kenny?	[]
Kyle	6	0	Yeah. That's not cool, dude.	[]
Bebe	5	0	Bye, Kenny. See you tomorrow.	[]
Other	2	0	Bye, Kenny.	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Bye, ladies.)	[]
Clyde	5	0	Hey, what's going on?	[]
Kyle	6	0	Tweek and Craig are gonna fight.	[]
Clyde	16	0	Really? Cool.  It's funny, 'cause Tweek and Craig both went home about fifteen minutes ago.	[]
Kyle	1	0	What?	[]
Token	3	0	Yeah, they left.	[]
Stan	2	1	Aw, hell!	['hell']
Cartman	4	1	Those sons of bitches!	['bitches']
Clyde	7	0	I guess they don't wanna fight.	[]
Kyle	11	0	Aw, they wanna fight! They just don't know it yet!	[]
Stan	1	0	Tweek?	[]
Kyle	1	0	Tweek?	[]
Other	6	0	Herr. What do you guys want?	[]
Stan	11	0	How come you didn't show up for the fight, Tweek?!	[]
Other	10	0	Craig and I have no reason to fight each other.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Well, Craig showed up.	[]
Other	2	0	He did?	[]
Stan	51	0	Yeah. He was standing there waiting for you, and he was all like, Man, Tweek's a wuss, and we were all like, No he's not, Craig, and he was all like, Yeah he is, he isn't showing up. He's a big wuss, and he has crooked teeth!	[]
Other	6	0	I don't have crooked teeth!	[]
Kyle	34	0	And then Craig was all like, Tweek is scared o'me. He's a big chicken. And he started doing an impersonation of you being a chicken;  well, everybody in the world saw it!	[]
Other	5	0	Everyone in the world?! Rrrr!	[]
Stan	4	0	Yeah, it was weak.	[]
Other	5	0	I'm not a chicken!	[]
Kyle	10	0	Well, everyone in the world thinks you are. See ya.	[]
Other	4	0	Wait! I'll fight!	[]
Stan	1	0	Tomorrow?	[]
Other	1	0	Okay.	[]
Cartman	16	1	Craig, what the hell are you doing home?! You're supposed to be out fighting Tweek!	['hell']
Craig	4	0	Red Racer's on.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Craig, you can watch Red Racer any day of the week!	[]
Craig	10	0	I do watch Red Racer every day of the week!	[]
Cartman	17	0	Well, that's fine. I guess you don't care about what Tweek said about your mom.	[]
Craig	1	0	Nope.	[]
Cartman	19	1	Egh. God damn it!  Well, I guess you don't care about what Tweek said about your guinea pig.	['damn']
Craig	7	0	What?! What did he say about Stripe?!	[]
Cartman	15	1	Oh, nothing, except that you stick it up your ass before you go to bed.	['ass']
Craig	9	1	That son of a bitch, I'll kill him!	['bitch']
Cartman	15	0	Yeah, I'd be pissed too, so maybe we should reschedule the fight for tomorrow?	[]
Craig	3	0	After Red Racer.	[]
Cartman	5	0	After Red Racer, of course.	[]
Other	5	0	How was school today, son?	[]
Other	1	0	Errh!	[]
Other	3	0	That's great.	[]
Other	14	0	Dahad, if some kid in school wants to fight me, what should I do??	[]
Other	39	0	Son, let me tell you a little story about when your mother and I first met.  You see, a long time ago, there were a lot of guys who were after your mother. She used to be very attractive.	[]
Other	5	0	It's true. I was.	[]
Other	41	0	Well, when I started courting your mother, there was this big muscular football player named Quib, who didn't take too kindly to me. He wanted your mother all to himself. And so, one day, he challenged me to a fight.	[]
Other	1	0	Well?	[]
Other	3	0	Well what, honey?	[]
Other	3	0	Nrr. What happened?	[]
Other	12	0	Oh'd. I, I don't know. He moved away or something.	[]
Other	6	0	Yes, I think that's right.	[]
Other	20	0	Rrrrr! You guys never help me!  Your stories never go anywhere! I hate it! I want out! I want out!	[]
Craig	10	0	Dad, I'm supposed to get in a fight tomorrow.	[]
Other	2	0	With who?	[]
Craig	2	0	Some kid.	[]
Other	1	0	Oh.	[]
Other	6	0	Don't just Oh him, Thomas!	[]
Craig	6	0	Yeah, don't just Oh me!	[]
Other	6	0	I'll Oh whoever I want!	[]
Other	8	0	Well, that was fun, Pearl. See you later.	[]
Other	9	0	Richard, aren't you going to invite me in?	[]
Other	1	0	Why?	[]
Other	16	0	Well, I thought maybe you would at least at-tempt to make love to me tonight.	[]
Other	11	0	Oh, well, uuh, I can't. I left the oven on.	[]
Other	12	0	Oh, Richard, why can't you open your heart to me? Why?	[]
Other	12	0	I just... I can't. Oh, I know. I have genital warts.	[]
Other	5	0	We'll use plastic wrap.	[]
Other	6	0	Nope. Sorry. Maybe some other time.	[]
Other	55	0	Swing me Richard, swing me higher. I wanna touch the sky, Richard.  Richard, I'm here!  Smile.  Oh, Richard, it's beautiful. Yes. Yes.  But you have to come see me fly tomorrow, Richard. I have a surprise for you.  Don't worry, Richard. I'll pilot! It's what I do!  Aaaaaaa!  Richard!  Richard.	[]
Other	8	0	Haaarrr!  Aw, God, what am I gonna do?	[]
Stan	32	0	Okay, so, just to set the record straight here, the fight will be happening out by the tetherball pole at 3:30. Tweek just weighed in at 48 pounds, Craig at 45.	[]
Clyde	10	0	Uh, how long do you expect the fight to last?	[]
Craig	2	0	I uh...	[]
Cartman	33	0	However long Craig wants it to last.  T'heh, ub. Look, make no mistake. Craig has been ready for this fight since day one. He doesn't even view it as a challenge.	[]
Kyle	14	1	He'll view it as a challenge when he's getting his ass kicked!	['ass']
Cartman	18	0	Hup. Did you hear that? It sound like some diarrhea coming out of someone's mouth or something.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Shut up, fatass!!	[]
Cartman	10	2	Don't call me fat, you son of a bitch!	['fat', 'bitch']
Clyde	15	0	Wow. Tweek and Craig really hate each other, huh? This should be a good fight.	[]
Other	95	0	On your first date, look at the man's shoes. Sometimes you can tell how much money a man has just by his shoes.  When he takes you out to dinner, try to sneak a peek at his wallet while he pays for you. If he only has one credit card, BEWARE.  It means he doesn't spend a lot, and worse yet, it could be a debit card. If he has more than four credit cards, that's a little fishy.  The perfect number of credit cards for a man to have is... two.	[]
Bebe	21	0	What if we meet a guy who wants to be a doctor or a lawyer, but is still getting his degree?	[]
Other	30	0	Dump that zero and get yourself a hero! He could be earning that degree all his life while you starve to death with two dying babies sucking at your teats.	[]
Cartman	23	0	When I have your guys' ten bucks, I'm gonna use it to buy the sweetest big-screen TV in the whole world.	[]
Kyle	9	0	That's more than ten bucks, you stupid fatass!	[]
Cartman	14	0	Well, if I get ten buck from each of you, that's like $2000.	[]
Other	9	0	Hey, quit screwing around back there! You're horsing!	[]
Other	51	0	Ri-chard!  Ri-chard!  Swing me Richard, swing me higher! Richard, I'm here!  Oh, Richard, it's beautiful. Yes. Yes.  But you have to come see me fly tomorrow, Richard. I have a surprise for you.  Don't worry, Richard. I'll pilot!  It's all for you!  Aaaaaaa!  Richard!	[]
Clyde	4	0	Mr. Adler. Mr. Adler!	[]
Other	3	0	Huh? Uh, what?	[]
Clyde	8	0	Tommy stuck his face in the belt sander	[]
Other	31	0	The belt sander? Tommy?? I told you not to screw around with the belt sander, didn't I?  Well go on. Go see the nurse; she'll give you some peroxide.	[]
Clyde	3	0	What's that?	[]
Other	12	0	Huh? Oh, this is a woman I knew a long time ago.	[]
Clyde	5	0	What? She die or something?	[]
Other	10	0	What? Hey! Go on!  You're screwing around in here!	[]
Clyde	5	0	Oh boy! Here we go!	[]
Wendy	3	0	What's happening?	[]
Kyle	5	0	Tweek's gonna fight Craig!	[]
Wendy	2	0	Oh cool!	[]
Stan	10	0	Stay pissed, Tweek. Stay pissed.  All right. Here we go.	[]
Kyle	9	1	Time for you to get proven wrong, fat boy.	['fat']
Cartman	8	1	You're gonna be eating those words, asshole.	['asshole']
Kyle	11	0	No I won't, because you'd eat 'em first, tubby.	[]
Stan	1	0	Well?	[]
Cartman	2	0	Come on!	[]
Wendy	9	0	Yeah, if you're gonna do it, do it!	[]
Craig	4	0	What do we do?	[]
Stan	1	0	Huh?	[]
Cartman	13	0	What do you mean, what do you do? You just fight each other.	[]
Other	1	0	How?	[]
Kyle	1	0	How??	[]
Craig	8	0	I've never been in a fight before.	[]
Other	2	0	Me neither.	[]
Other	1	0	Awwww.	[]
Stan	4	0	Aw, dude, come on!!	[]
Cartman	9	0	You just hit each other, smack each other around.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Not like that!	[]
Other	3	0	Like what, then?	[]
Stan	21	0	All right, all right, screw it! We have to postpone the fight 'til Tweek and Craig can learn how to fight.	[]
Other	1	0	Awww.	[]
Clyde	6	0	All that build-up for nothing.	[]
Wendy	9	0	Yeah. Christ, I could have been home by now!	[]
Stan	15	0	All right. Tweek, we'll teach you how to fight, and Cartman, you teach Craig.	[]
Cartman	18	0	I don't think that's very fair: if I teach Craig, he's gonna really kill Tweek.	[]
Stan	15	0	Oh yeah? Well, I'm gonna have my uncle Jimbo teach Tweek how to box!	[]
Cartman	14	0	Ooooo! Boxing's scary, you guys!  I'm gonna have Craig learn martial arts!	[]
Stan	8	0	Fine! We'll see you back here tomorrow!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Fine!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Fine!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Fine, that's fine!	[]
Other	17	0	Alrighty. Tweek, my little nephew Stanley has asked me to teach you the fine points of boxing.	[]
Other	1	0	Rrrrh!	[]
Other	19	0	You're in luck! Ned here used to be the state champion until a grenade blew his arm off.	[]
Other	6	1	Mmrr I can still kick ass.	['ass']
Other	41	0	Now, Tweek, boxing is a Man sport. There is nothing in the world more Man than boxing. It is Man at his most Man. So when you spar with Ned here, just dig deep into that most Man part of you.	[]
Other	1	0	Hwaaah!	[]
Other	10	0	Well, enough of the lectures. let's get to boxing.	[]
Other	1	0	Uugh!	[]
Other	5	0	Mmm whatcha got, bee-ahtch?	[]
Other	5	0	Keep your guard up, Tweek!	[]
Other	1	0	Ow!	[]
Stan	2	1	Damn it!	['damn']
Kyle	9	0	Come on, Tweek! He's only got one arm!	[]
Other	15	0	All right, looks like we'll have to apply the Oppenheimer technique with Tweek here.	[]
Other	5	0	Gmmmmm, whatcha got, bee-ahtch?	[]
Other	6	1	Punch him in the balls, Tweek!!	['balls']
Other	1	0	AAAAaaaarrgh.	[]
Other	11	0	Atta boy! Now quick, get him again while he's down!	[]
Other	1	0	Ow.	[]
Other	14	1	Good! Now kick his balls!  There, see? You've got him coughing up blood.	['balls']
Other	1	0	Hooray!	[]
Other	1	0	Rrrr!	[]
Other	4	0	Now THAT'S BOXING!	[]
Other	33	0	Your friend hasa brought you to learn the ancient art ofa sumo. You must learna discipline anda respect.  In sumo, your body must be rike a stone, and your mind rike a meatroaf.	[]
Craig	1	0	Meatloaf?	[]
Other	13	0	The object is simpry to push opponent out of circle. Is opponent ready?	[]
Cartman	12	0	I'm ready!  Hey, I like this hair thing. This is cool.	[]
Other	7	0	Let us begin.  Ready? And, th-ree.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Respect my authoritah!	[]
Other	8	0	Body rike a stone! Mind rike a meatroaf!	[]
Cartman	6	0	Dude. Come on, now. Come on.	[]
Craig	8	0	Oh, Jesus! I can't take it! Stop!	[]
Other	5	1	Fight back! Resist the ass!	['ass']
Craig	8	1	How can I resist an ass so great?	['ass']
Other	13	2	It is only an ass. You must overcome the ass with your mind.	['ass', 'ass']
Craig	9	1	This ass is unlike any I've encountered, Master.	['ass']
Cartman	2	0	I win!	[]
Other	17	1	There is indeed great power in your ass, Eric. Perhaps you should consider sumo as your profession.	['ass']
Cartman	2	0	Hey, maybe.	[]
Other	5	0	No. No. Make it stop.	[]
Other	36	0	Oh, Richard. Say you'll hold me forever.  But you have to come see me fly tomorrow, Richard. I have a surprise for you.  Don't worry, Richard. I'm a pilot!  Watch me, Richard!  Richard!	[]
Other	24	0	Baaaaa!  I never got to say good-bye. I never got to say good-bye!  Oh no! Oh NO! NOW what do I do?!	[]
Other	20	0	Okay, that was very good, class. Now let's try this one together.  Honey, can I get a new wardrobe?	[]
Other	7	0	Honey, can I get a new wardrobe?	[]
Other	19	0	All right, now let's try this one together.  Lisa Smith's husband just bought HER a new car....	[]
Other	10	0	Lisa Smith's husband just bought HER a new car....	[]
Other	21	1	Good. Bebe, why don't you try this one.  I think a trip to Hawaii would really improve our sex life.	['sex']
Bebe	12	1	I think a trip to Hawaii would really improve our sex life.	['sex']
Other	21	0	Outstanding! Now, Kenny, how about you try?  I can't make love to you until we get a king-size bed.	[]
Kenny	14	0	(I can't make love to you until we get a king-size bed!)	[]
Other	12	0	O-kay. Kenny, could I talk to you over here real quick?	[]
Kenny	3	0	(Sure you can.)	[]
Other	22	0	Kenny, I don't know quite how to tell you this, but... I'm not sure home economics is right for you.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Why?)	[]
Other	33	0	Well, your cooking is unsatisfactory, your sewing skills are below average, and, frankly, I don't think the odds of you marrying a nice rich man in the future are very, well, good.	[]
Kenny	3	0	(You don't?)	[]
Other	10	0	No. I think you should consider transferring to shop class.	[]
Kenny	6	0	(Shop class?)  (No, I won't!)	[]
Other	12	0	Now, now. Very few students are severely injured in a shop class.	[]
Kenny	7	0	(I don't wanna take shop class!)	[]
Bebe	8	0	Come on! It's time for the fight!	[]
Wendy	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Other	11	0	Fight? Oh no no, girls! Haven't I taught you anything?	[]
Stan	6	0	Okay, the time has finally come.	[]
Clyde	6	0	Programs, get your programs here. Programs.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Remember, Tweek: punch hard, punch low.	[]
Other	1	0	Hrrr.	[]
Kyle	8	0	This is when you gotta get mean, Tweek.	[]
Other	3	0	Rrrr, mean, rrrr.	[]
Cartman	15	0	The spirit of the dragon is in your hands. Hurshar kashurshar. Hurlong churshar. All right?	[]
Craig	1	0	Okay.	[]
Cartman	14	0	Now, LISTEN to me! Hurlong kashurshar! All right?! And seriously: Hurlong kepur shung kwong!	[]
Craig	2	0	Okay, okay!	[]
Other	2	0	Rrrr!  Hr.	[]
Stan	11	0	You ready Tweek? You ready Craig? Let's get in on!	[]
Craig	3	0	Respect my authority.	[]
Other	3	0	Come on, Tweek!	[]
Cartman	3	0	Come on, Craig!	[]
Other	16	1	Good-bye, cruel world.  Jesus Christ! What was I thinking?! That would have hurt like hell!	['hell']
Stan	2	0	Ye-hah!	[]

Kyle	7	1	Go, Tweek. Kick his ass! Get him!	['ass']
Cartman	3	0	Come on, Craig!	[]
Stan	6	0	Come on, Tweek! You got him!	[]
Kyle	8	0	Get him!  Whoa, Tweek! Did you hear that?	[]
Other	1	0	What?	[]
Kyle	6	1	Craig just called you a boner!	['boner']
Other	1	0	Rrrr!	[]
Kyle	12	0	We'll just have to keep throwing jabs to win the fight.	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Kenny	3	0	(Hi, Mr. Adler.)	[]
Other	32	0	What? Who are you?  Kenny McCormick has been transferred from home ec to shop class. Well, all right. Get some safety goggles and start gettin' acquainted with the jigsaw over there.  Hrh.	[]
Other	1	0	Huh?	[]
Other	2	0	What the-?	[]
Stan	3	0	Here they are.	[]
Other	5	0	Hey! What's going on?	[]
Stan	9	0	Tweek and Craig are fighting. We're just watching.	[]
Other	9	1	Well, why the hell don't you stop them?	['hell']
Cartman	8	0	'Cause we have ten bucks riding on it.	[]
Other	4	0	Don't screw aROUND!	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Hey!)  (Hey!)	[]
Other	3	0	Stop screwin' aROUND!!	[]
Kenny	4	1	(Hey, God damn it!)	['damn']
Other	8	0	Eh. Hey, you're SCREWIN' AROUND TOO MUCH!!	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Ugh!)	[]
Stan	6	0	Oh my God, they killed Kenny!	[]

Kenny	3	0	(I understand, dude.)	[]
Other	5	0	What? What's that, son?	[]
Other	1	0	Richard.	[]
Other	16	0	AAaaagh!  No! No, please don't go. I need you. I can't live without you.	[]
Other	12	0	Richard, you have to move on. I want you to be happy.	[]
Other	13	0	But I can't. I never got a chance to say good-bye.	[]
Other	5	0	Then say it now, Richard.	[]
Other	2	0	Good-bye?	[]
Other	6	0	There. Now do you feel better?	[]
Other	1	0	No.	[]
Other	28	0	Of course you don't. Saying good-bye doesn't mean anything. It's the time that we spent together that really matters, not how we loved it.	[]
Other	7	0	You... you're right. You're right.	[]
Other	4	0	Richard, this is Grandma.	[]
Other	4	0	Gram'ma? Hi, Gram!	[]
Other	8	0	You never said good-bye to me either.	[]
Other	4	0	Hey, Richard. Remember me?	[]
