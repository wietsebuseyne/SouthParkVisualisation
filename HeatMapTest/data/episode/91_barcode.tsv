Kyle	4	0	Is he in there?	[]
Stan	4	0	I can't see.	[]
Cartman	8	1	What the hell is this?! Chocolate milk mix?!	['hell']
Kyle	10	0	I knew Kenny couldn't fit in that tea pot!	[]
Stan	4	0	It wa a trick!	[]
Cartman	10	1	God-damnit! This isn't even GOOD chocolate milk mix!	['damnit']
Stan	24	0	Kenny's parents must be laughing pretty hard about now! We're dumb enough to believe Kenny's body could be in a teapot!	[]
Kyle	10	0	Why would they play such a cruel joke on us?	[]
Cartman	25	0	Egh, because they're poor, Kyle! Poor people don't have anything better to do than piss other people off! Don't you watch Springer?!	[]

Cartman	4	0	Hmmm.  Hmm, not bad.	[]
Other	10	0	Hurry up, Kenny! You're gonna be late for school!	[]
Cartman	13	0	Huh! ... I don't think that chocolate milk mix agreed with my stomach.	[]
Stan	3	0	Cartman, come on!	[]
Cartman	11	0	What what?  Jesus, you buttholes! It's six in the morning!	[]
Stan	14	0	Kyle figured out a way to get our winning ticket stub back from Kenny!	[]
Cartman	1	0	How?	[]
Kyle	19	1	A ladder to heaven.  We build it, climb up, and get our winning ticket back from that asshole Kenny.	['asshole']
Randy	14	0	Hey, if you boys are building a clubhouse you should start with the floor.	[]
Stan	13	0	We're not building a clubhouse, we're building a ladder to heaven.	[]
Randy	6	0	A ladder to heaven? Why, son?	[]
Stan	6	0	Because we wanna see Kenny again.	[]
Other	6	0	Oh... oh, that's so sweet.	[]

Other	75	0	Tom, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado, where last December, eight-year-old Kenny McCormick died of a terminal illness. But now, that little boy's three closest friends miss their friend so much that they are building a ladder to heaven, in order to-  a ladder to heaven in order to try to see him again.  It's so sad and yet so beautiful, Tom. Here's what some people had to say.	[]
Randy	33	0	Well, our son just said to us that he really needed to see his little friend Kenny again and... and that he thought it would work...  if he... built the ladder to heaven.	[]
Other	23	0	They just believe in their little hearts that it will work. We can't tell them it won't, we just can't!	[]
Other	11	0	It shows how beautiful the innocence of a child really is.	[]
Mr. Garrison	8	1	A ladder to heaven? That's fuckin' stupid.	['fuckin']
Other	18	0	These boys symbolize how we all feel about loss. Who are we to tell them it's impossible?	[]
Other	86	0	Tom, people from all over the-  Sorry.  People from all over the country are coming to see the ladder, feeling a connection to its symbolism, and beauty. Even country singer Alan Jackson has shown up with a song he has written about the ladder.  Alan Jackson is, of course, the man who wrote the song, Where Were You When the World Stopped Turning, about the tragedies on September 11. And now he's here once again to capitalize on people's emotions. Let's listen in.	[]
Other	26	1	Where were you when they built the ladder to heaven?  Did it make you feel like cryin', or did you think it was kind of gay?	['gay']
Other	4	0	What a beautiful song.	[]
Other	47	0	Well I, for one, believe in the ladder to heaven. Oh yeah yeah yeah. 9-11 I said 9-11, 9-11, 9-11, Ni-hi, hi-hine___ Eleven. Thank you! I have a new CD out with all my 9-11 songs for sale right here!	[]

Kyle	2	0	Cartman? Cartman?!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Wha-uh, what?? What?	[]
Kyle	8	1	Dude, what the hell's wrong with you?!	['hell']
Cartman	13	0	I don't know. It's like my brain just keeps... jacking off.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Maybe you got brain cancer.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Do you think?	[]
Stan	16	0	Don't get cancer on the ladder, Cartman! You're gonna fall off and break it!	[]
Other	33	0	The nation is rallying behind three sweet boys in Colorado who are building a ladder to heaven to be with their dead friend.  It's making Americans start to believe in heaven, again.	[]
Other	24	0	Well when I see how this ladder has brought people together, how... how it has changed America, I mean, how can I not believe?	[]
Other	10	0	Ha do YOU actually believe in the ladder to heaven?	[]
Other	20	1	If... heaven is an eight-year-old boy, and the ladder is my penis...  and the pearly gates are the-	['penis']
Other	40	0	Uh, meanwhile, the American economy cont-  wait. Wait. Wait a minute. We are getting reports now that Japan is building their own ladder to heaven to compete with the US's. Let's go live to SNN correspondent Nobuhiro Sabasurisurijuwa.	[]
Other	56	0	This is a Nobunaga Hiroichi reporting rive from Tokyo, where Japan has started buirding its own radder to hayben.  Ahready, the Japanese radder extend faaar into space  and it's growing by a-one thousand miles every day.  As the endeavor continues it is becoming clear that Japan will reach a-hayben before the United States.	[]
Other	2	0	Nahurabo Nahurabo	[]
Stan	20	0	Excuse me.  Excuse me!  Uh, we ran out of stuff.  We ran out of stuff to build the ladder with.	[]
Other	2	0	Oh no!	[]
Other	3	0	Oh Jesus, no!	[]
Other	15	0	Where were you when they ran out of stuff to build the ladder to heaven?	[]
Stan	14	0	We can keep going, but we need to start tearing down houses for wood.	[]
Randy	13	0	No! Agh, look, I, I think maybe this has gone on far enough.	[]
Other	21	0	Yeah... Ih it's time we told the boys the truth, that they aren't really going to get to heaven.	[]
Other	2	0	Wait! Look!	[]
Other	38	0	We've come to help you beat those Japs, boys!  There won't be anyone stopping this great ladder from being built today!  Alpha Team! Get that support structure up! Ciranom's Team! Get us photos and recon!	[]
Other	2	0	Yes sir!	[]
Other	10	0	Where were you when they saved that ladder to heaven?	[]
Kyle	16	0	Man, I can't believe how much people want us to get our winning ticket back.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Candy-shopping sprees have that effect on people, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Do you see anything?	[]
Stan	4	0	No. Hello?? Kenny?? God??	[]
Kyle	1	0	Grandma??	[]
Cartman	14	0	Aw, don't tell me we haven't even reached the cloud city yet!	[]
Stan	15	0	No cloud city, not even a giant. Heaven must still be a long way off.	[]
Cartman	29	0	Alright, look. I didn't wanna have to say this, but I think maybe we're not seeing heaven because one of us doesn't believe in it enough.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Huh?	[]
Cartman	21	0	Heaven could be like the pixie faeries of Bubble Yum Forest. You only see them if you really believe in them.	[]
Stan	1	0	What??	[]
Cartman	17	0	You know, maybe we're not seeing heaven because one of us is a J-O-O.	[]
Kyle	11	1	What does me being a Jew have to do with anything?!	['jew']
Cartman	7	1	Because Jews don't believe in heaven!	['jews']
Kyle	8	0	Yes we do! Just not the Christian heaven!	[]
Cartman	25	0	Right. Your idea of heaven is getting five dollars off your matzah ball soup at Barney's Beanery by lying about a hair in it.	[]
Kyle	1	0	HAAHH!!!	[]
Cartman	1	0	AH!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Hey Kenny.	[]
Stan	2	0	Hey Kenny.	[]
Kenny	7	0	(We can watch it at my house.)	[]
Cartman	30	0	In the ghetto, in the ghetto. He's a boy wearing orange, who's losing his pride, 'cause Kenny and his whole family reside in the ghetto, in the ghetto	[]
Kenny	7	1	(Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching vagina!)	['vagina']
Cartman	4	0	What did you say?!	[]
Kenny	9	1	(I said, Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching vagina!)	['vagina']
Cartman	4	0	What did you say?!	[]
Cartman	18	2	I said Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching vagina!  Did I just call myself a blood-belching vagina?	['vagina', 'vagina']
Stan	8	1	Dude, what the hell is wrong with you??	['hell']
Cartman	16	0	I dunno, I just, I keep feeling like I'm Kenny. Seeing memories through his eyes.	[]
Kyle	7	1	You're too fat to be Kenny.	['fat']
Cartman	5	1	You're a- stupid Jew.	['jew']
Stan	15	0	Let's just keep building. We only have five more days until the shopping spree.	[]
Other	12	0	Alright, how's the ladder going, General? Are we beating the Japanese.	[]
Other	25	0	Not quite, but we have a new problem, Mr. President. Our recon team on the ladder just found new evidence of threats... from Saddam Hussein.	[]
Other	13	0	Saddam Hussein? But... we killed him! We secretly took him out months ago!	[]
Other	15	0	Yes sir. And now we believe he's building weapons of mass destruction... in heaven.	[]
Other	8	1	Dear Christ, that sonofabitch just doesn't stop!	['sonofabitch']
Other	41	0	These surveillance photos were taken atop the ladder of what appears to be heaven.  Here we see what we believe to be a missile silo. And here  we see what looks like a laboratory of some sort for making chemical weapons.	[]
Other	6	0	That... kinda looks like a seagull.	[]
Other	10	0	Yes. It could be a laboratory disguised as a seagull.	[]
Other	3	1	That tricky bastard!	['bastard']
Other	16	0	Sir, you must understand our fears. We must take out those facilities. We must...  bomb heaven!	[]
Other	38	0	SNN Question of the Day: Now that Americans believe in heaven, should we bomb it? The polls right now show that 51% of Americans think Saddam has to be dealt with, while 49% are wimpy tree-hugging pussies.	[]
Other	17	0	War is not my voice! This country is just run by rednecks and bumpkins with their guns!	[]
Other	9	0	We have to take Saddam out to protect ourselves.	[]
Other	26	1	I, for one, believe that if Saddam Hussein were an eight-year-old boy, and my penis were the United States...  then there would-  hard nipples!	['penis']
Other	2	1	God-damnit!	['damnit']
Other	55	0	Tom, it's been five days since three sweet boys set out to build a ladder to heaven and caption the nation's hearts. They've made a nation believe heaven might be up there. And it could prove to be a threat to our country. President Bush will seek UN approval for military action.	[]
Randy	17	0	Boys, it's really neat that you want to see your old pal Kenny so much but...	[]
Other	16	0	But it's time for you to get back to school and on with your lives.	[]
Stan	6	0	No, we have to see Kenny!	[]
Other	17	0	You have to understand that Kenny's body isn't up in the clouds. He was cremated.	[]
Stan	4	0	Cremated? What's that?	[]
Randy	19	0	When you die, your body is put into a broiling oven and cooked until you're nothing but ashes.	[]
Kyle	6	0	What?? For God's sake, why??	[]
Other	8	0	Kyle, it's just what some people do.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Are you gonna burn me?	[]
Other	8	0	Kyle, that's not the issue right now.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Jesus Christ!	[]
Randy	17	0	The person's ashes are put into an urn, and that's where Kenny's body is.	[]
Other	16	0	You see boys, Kenny is in here.  What the???  Wait a minute! This is kitty litter!	[]
Cartman	14	0	Alright, alright, I drank the chocolate milk mix and replaced it with kitty litter.	[]
Other	2	0	You WHAT??	[]
Stan	11	0	Dude, don't you know what this means? You drank Kenny!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Shut up!	[]
Kyle	8	0	You did, dude! You drank his whole body!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Shut up!	[]
Other	8	0	Oh my God! This is awful!  And disgusting!	[]
Other	3	0	Bad, Eric, bad!	[]
Cartman	18	0	That explains it. Why I'm having Kenny's memories all the time. His soul is inside me.	[]
Stan	16	0	Well, so much for our winning ticket. Cartman probably drank that with the rest of Kenny!	[]
Kyle	4	0	Yeah. Good job, fatass!	[]
Cartman	21	0	I can't live like this. I, I have to find a place where they remove living souls from your body.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Looks like I've come to the right place.	[]
Other	4	0	Can I help you?	[]
Cartman	17	0	Yes, hello. I have a living thing inside of me that needs to be sucked out, please.	[]
Other	15	0	You'll have to make an appointment; the charge is two hundred and thirty dollars.	[]
Cartman	23	1	Two hundred and thirty dollars?? I just want you to vacuum him out of me and not put him up in a condominium!	['condominium']
Other	6	0	It's gonna be okay, babe.	[]
Cartman	28	1	Listen, lady! You've got to get this crap out of me!  I don't want him in me anymore! Just suck him up and throw him out!	['crap']
Other	14	0	Oh Steven, I can't go through with this! I have to keep it!	[]
Other	6	2	Damnit! Damnit!  Thanks a lot, kid!	['damnit', 'damnit']
Cartman	1	0	Eh!	[]
Cartman	29	0	Kenny! Kenny! kenny... 6,12,Stan,Kenny! Lolly's Candy Land is giving away a shopping spree! 6,12,Kyle,We're all gonna pitch in on an entry!	[]
Other	10	0	Alright! There you go. Hold on to that ticket stub.	[]
Stan	9	0	Hold on to this, Cartman. I might lose it.	[]
Cartman	19	0	Nah, I'll lose it for sure. You keep track of it, Kyle, of it, Kyle, of it Kyle...	[]
Kyle	23	0	Okay. N-no, ah I don't want that much responsibility-bility. Here, you hold on to it, Kenny.  6,12,Kenny,(Okay!)	[]
Cartman	21	3	You'd better not lose that ticket, Kenny, or else I'll kick you in the nuts! The nuts! The nuts!	['nuts', 'nuts', 'nuts']
Cartman	36	0	The ticket! Kenny didn't have it on him when he died! He put it away somewhere!  Don't you see? I can still have my candy shopping spree! Oh my God!  You guys! YOU GUYS!!	[]
Other	48	0	Ladies and gentlemen of the UN, we have evidence that Saddam Hussein is up there building weapons of mass destruction.  We have tried to communicate with Saddam through a psychic to ask him to let us see his warehouses in heaven. But he has not re-spond-ed.	[]
Other	10	0	Of course he has not responded, because he's DEAD!	[]
Other	5	0	Right. Dead, and in heaven.	[]
Other	21	0	This is preposterous! Even if there was a heaven, what makes you think Saddam Hussein's soul would be sent there?	[]
Other	78	3	Our intelligence tells us that when Saddam was originally killed, his soul actually went to hell. But while in hell he began a homosexual relationship with Satan, the Prince of Darkness. Satan, however, decided he didn't want to be with Hussein anymore and broke up with him about August.  When Saddam became jealous and tried to kill Satan's new lover, Chris, Satan had Saddam sent to heaven to live with Mormons as a punishment.  Question?  Yes?	['hell', 'hell', 'homosexual']
Other	7	0	Are you high, or just incredibly stupid?	[]
Other	7	0	I assure you, I am not high.	[]
Cartman	8	0	You guys! You guys! I saw the ticket!	[]
Kyle	5	0	What do you mean, fatass?	[]
Cartman	20	0	I just had another vision, you buttholes. Kenny didn't keep the ticket with him, he put it away somewhere.	[]
Stan	1	0	Where??	[]
Cartman	45	0	I don't know. I got conked in the head down at the abortion clinic  and I clearly saw Kenny putting the ticket in a little red box.  I just have to wait for another vision to come. I could clearly see through Ken-  AY!	[]
Kyle	4	0	Do you see anything?	[]
Cartman	7	1	Yes, Kyle. I see a DEAD JEW!	['jew']
Stan	11	0	Whoawhoawhoa! Maybe Kyle's right. We gotta spark the vision somehow.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Not by giving me brain damage!	[]
Stan	9	0	Do you want a candy shopping spree or not?!	[]
Cartman	6	0	Alright, go ahead.  AY!... no.  AY!...	[]
Other	16	0	Randy! Gerald! We, we were wrong about heaven! The Japanese just reached it with their ladder!	[]
Randy	1	0	What?	[]
Other	3	0	See for yourself!	[]
Other	57	0	This is a Nobunaga Hiroichi reporting rive from hayben.  The great a-nation of Japan reached a-hayben today about eight o'crock Pacific Standard Time-eh.  Therefore, hayben is now a-decrared an official part of Japan, because we got a-here first. And now for the weather in heaben, let's go to Natsako Semu.	[]
Other	6	0	Todeh weather in hebon, partry croudy.	[]
Other	11	0	That's the news from heben.  Dame! Dame da! Bakayarou da!!	[]
Randy	12	0	Oh God, and we told our boys they'd never reach heaven.	[]
Other	1	0	Kids!	[]
Other	17	0	Good. As soon as the boys finish their ladder we'll be ready to take Saddam out.	[]
Other	10	0	Do you really think this is a good idea, Randy?	[]
Randy	13	0	If Saddam is building weapons, we have to stop him. With our weapons.	[]
Stan	18	0	Ah, excuse me everyone! Uh, we're not working on the ladder anymore. Thank you, we're done.	[]
Other	1	0	Dude.	[]
Other	14	0	Not working on the ladder? But the Japanese won't let us use theirs.	[]
Kyle	24	0	Kenny didn't have the ticket stub. It was in his room. So we got all our candy, and you can all go home.	[]
Randy	21	0	Wait, are you saying that you boys only wanted to build a ladder to heaven so you could get some candy??	[]
Cartman	14	0	...I've never heard the words only and candy in the same sentence before.	[]
Other	19	0	But... what about your lost friend? What about your fragile innocence and believing we could all get to heaven?	[]
Stan	18	0	Yeah, well people make us kids believe that heaven is this white place with fluffy clouds and angels...	[]
Kyle	38	1	Yeah, but now we think maybe heaven isn't a place you can get to, maybe heaven is just an idea. A frame of mind or, or something gay like that. Maybe heaven... is this moment, right now.	['gay']
Other	13	0	So, you're saying we should bomb this moment, right now. Right! Johnson!	[]
Other	1	0	Sir!	[]
Randy	38	0	No, no. We shouldn't bomb anybody. These boys are right. The only heaven we can hope for is one here on earth, now. We should stop waiting to get into heaven and start trying to... create it.	[]
Other	1	0	Awwww.	[]
Other	15	0	And I was dumb enough to believe Saddam could actually be up there buildin' bombs.	[]
Other	29	1	Where were you when they decided heaven was a more intangible idea 'n you couldn't, you couldn't really get there?  You little bastards ruined my latest song!	['bastards']
Kyle	16	0	Well, I'm sure glad this is all over with. Let's go count our candy.	[]
Stan	13	0	Yeah. But what about Kenny. His soul is still in Cartman's body.	[]
Cartman	29	3	No no, I just drank his memories. I'm not sharing my body with that poor piece of crap. Stop calling me poor, you fat dick!  ...Oh Jesus Christ.	['crap', 'fat', 'dick']
Kyle	5	0	Whoa.  Kenny, you in there?	[]
Cartman	9	0	Stop it! Where am I, you guys? Oh God!	[]
Stan	4	0	Dude, come back here!	[]
Kyle	3	0	Stop him, Kenny!	[]
Other	14	0	Keep those nitrogen capsules over there by the warheads! Right. Chop-chop. Come on!	[]
Other	17	0	Saddam. I've been hearing rumors that you're secretly building weapons of mass destruction up here.	[]
Other	12	0	Weapons of mass destruction? Nooo! This is a chocolate chip factory. See?	[]
Other	7	0	It looks like a chemical weapons plant.	[]
Other	37	0	Look, God, if I was gonna secretly build a chemical weapons plant, I wouldn't make it look like a chemical weapons plant, would I? I'd make it look like a chocolate chip factory or something.	[]
Other	3	0	...Alright, just checking.	[]
