But then this mean little girl, called the Jelly Monster, she was sooo jelly of the hobbit that she told everyone she was a liar, and the hobbit's fiancee realized she was just a hobbit. And you know what he said? He said I don't CARE! And then the jelly monster came and tried to take the magic power away from the little hobbit, so the hobbit prayed to God, and God said Don't worry, little hobbit. I will go find this jelly monster girl, and I will read her a story and melt her icy heart. And the hobbit said Thank you, and the hobbit and God lived happily ever after in the shower forever 'cause I love her so much!__I'm sorry, hold up. Hold up. Hold up. I'm sorry.	['fat']
