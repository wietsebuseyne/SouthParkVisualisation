Other	10	0	Have you... never even... thought... of being... with another woman?	[]
Other	32	0	Oho goodness no! Of course I haven't. I mean... really I don't even understand how two women can make love. I mean un, unless they just kinda  scissor or something.	[]
Other	10	0	There are a lot of ways to make love, Janet.	[]
Other	15	0	I guess I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little ...titillated.	[]
Other	5	0	Could I... maybe kiss you?	[]
Other	13	0	Oh, this is wrong! You're another woman; it doesn't make sense!	[]

Clyde	5	0	No, I got it done.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Jimmy, did you finish your book report?	[]
Other	30	0	Yeah. I feel pretty good about it. I finished my whole book report and, I got a really nice letter from my ese who works down at the U-Haul.	[]
Cartman	1	1	Crap!	['crap']
Kyle	3	0	We're dead.	[]
Other	11	0	Hello, class. Here's my little desk , my nice lil chalkboard.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Mrs. Garrison, about our book reports.	[]
Other	18	0	Oho, that's okay Eric. If you need a little more time with your homework, just say so.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Really?	[]
Other	15	1	Kids, I need to tell you something that you might find shocking.  I'm gay.	['gay']
Stan	1	0	Again?	[]
Other	45	0	It was a shock to me too. I... met another woman and... we went to this fabulous bar called Les Bos where I finally felt at home. Allyson and I talked, and really opened up to each other and... then we...  scissored all night long.	[]
Butters	7	0	You have to be careful with scissors.	[]
Other	37	0	But listen, I am not going to just rush into a relationship with Allyson. I'm a late-in-life lesbian. So I need to play the field for a while, right?  Oh I'm so happy.	[]
Cartman	12	0	That's great! Let's hear it for Teacher being a lesbian!	[]
Other	1	0	Yay!	[]
Other	1	0	Teeheeheehee.	[]
Other	4	0	Hey Tracy, hey Kate.	[]
Other	2	0	Hi Janet.	[]
Other	10	0	Lookin' hot, Linda. Wanna go somewhere and scissor later on?	[]
Other	1	0	Huh?	[]
Other	2	0	Hey Patty.	[]
Other	4	0	What's up, Janet.	[]
Other	11	0	Ooo, stop giving me that look. Scissoring me with your eyes.	[]
Other	12	0	Hey Janet, why don't you pick up on your own girl?	[]
Other	20	2	Oh yeah, dyke fight!  You kicked me right in the pussy!  Uh? Oh! Oh, we're scissoring. Oh yeah, scissor!	['dyke', 'pussy']
Other	15	0	You guys. You guys, stop it. Listen to me, everybody. I got some bad news.	[]
Other	4	0	What is it, Katie?	[]
Other	8	0	They're closing down the bar. For good!	[]
Other	8	0	Closing it down? They can't do that.	[]
Other	4	0	This is our home.	[]
Other	5	0	Yeah, this is our home.	[]
Other	17	0	Well it's true, I just talked to the owners. They've sold the bar to Persians.	[]
Other	1	0	Persians?!	[]
Other	7	0	So where are we supposed to go?	[]
Other	20	0	We aren't going anywhere! We have a history here! Persians are closing this bar over my dead lesbian body!	[]
Other	12	0	Mayor, this is an outrage! We are being discriminated against as lesbians!	[]
Other	5	0	You're a lesbian now?	[]
Other	13	0	That's right. A proud lesbian! And our home is being taken away!	[]
Other	21	0	The bar has been sold to Persian club owners. I don't know what you want me to do about it.	[]
Other	22	0	Forbid the transaction! This is happening all over the country, Mayor. Lesbian bars being bought out, shut down, it isn't right!	[]
Other	4	0	Yeah, that's right!	[]
Other	25	0	I'm sorry, but my hands are tied. The new owners plan to start redecorating the bar tomorrow. You have to be out by then.	[]
Other	30	0	Have you seen how Persians decorate? They will cover that bar in cheesy blue carpeting, white statues and gold curtain rods to the point that you will want to puke!	[]
Other	6	0	Mrs. Garrison, get out of here.	[]
Other	10	0	Well, here's to some great times at this place.	[]
Other	13	0	Yeah. Guess we'll just have to find somewhere else to hang out.	[]
Other	18	0	Now, come on gals! I can't believe what I'm hearing! We can't just give up!	[]
Other	8	0	Well, what are we supposed to do, Janet?	[]
Other	17	0	We stand and fight! When the Persians come we tell them We aren't leaving Les Bos.	[]
Other	4	0	Actually, it's Lebow.	[]
Other	26	0	No, it's Les Bos!  We... are Lesbos! And as Lesbos, we cannot just stand and watch as one girl bar after another gets shut dowwwwwn!	[]
Other	9	0	The Persians have sent somebody to talk to us.	[]
Other	27	0	Hello, my name is Emir Hadi. My boss sent me over here because he heard that you were upset about us trying to take over the bar.	[]
Other	3	0	Yes, we are.	[]
Other	45	0	Well, we want to assure you that when this place becomes another Club Persh, you will all still be 100% welcome. All they want is to make the place really nice. We're going to put down some lovely blue carpet, and gold curtain rods.	[]
Other	6	0	I knew it! I knew it!	[]
Other	23	0	But you are still welcome to come. My boss wants you to know that you will not be discriminated against in any way.	[]
Other	7	0	Would you allow straight people in? Men?	[]
Other	5	0	Well... we would allow whoev-	[]
Other	6	0	Choose your next words wisely, Persian!	[]
Other	24	0	Look uhh, we don't have to offer you anything, so... I don't know why you're being so difficult. This is crazy.	[]
Other	9	0	No, this isn't crazy. This... is... Les Bos!	[]
Other	1	0	Ohhhhh!	[]
Other	3	0	How dare you!	[]
Other	29	1	And so it had begun. By kicking the Persian messenger in the balls, the lesbos had sent a message. . All over the country lesbians heard of the brave standoff.	['balls']
Other	18	0	As a group of lesbians in Colorado are refusing to allow the new owners of their bar in.	[]
Other	3	0	Good for them!	[]
Other	3	0	You go girls!	[]
Other	20	0	The Persians returned to their office and told their coworkers how the thirty lesbos were refusing to let them in.	[]
Other	25	0	Well fine. If they're going to block the entrance, we'll just bring like, sixty of us! I'll call more Persians for help.	[]
Other	21	0	The hours pass quickly, and the lesbians boldly stood out in front of their bar to stop the Persians from entering.	[]
Other	3	0	Here they come.	[]
Other	6	0	There's so many of them.	[]
Other	2	0	Lesbos! Positions!	[]
Other	10	0	Lesbians! Stand aside. We're coming in to redecorate it!	[]
Other	21	1	The hell you are! You can take your blue carpet and gold curtain rods and shove them up your Persian buttholes!	['hell']
Other	12	0	All right! Come on! They can't stop all of us! Huuu!	[]
Other	1	0	Huuu!	[]
Other	16	1	Lesbos! Remember this day! Remember this fight!  Don't give them an inch!  Ow! Iranian faggot!	['faggot']
Other	6	0	Come on, seriously, let us in!	[]
Other	1	0	Never!	[]
Other	38	0	For hours, the Lesbos kept the Persians back, holding them off, keeping them from decorating.  Finally the Persians grew tired. and many of them wanted to go shopping for more designer sunglasses. They retreated.  The Lesbos... had held.	[]
Other	1	0	Lesbohhhs!	[]
Other	2	0	Huok! Huok!	[]
Other	14	0	The Persians who did not go shopping now knew they must face their boss.	[]
Other	3	0	Here he comes.	[]
Other	20	0	Rauf Xerxes. He sat atop a gold Hummer with customized Gucci accessories which only a Persian would think was cool.	[]
Other	14	0	Mr. Xerxes, the Lesbos wouldn't move. We could not get inside to redecorate.	[]
Other	24	0	Tumon, how could you have failed me in this simple task? I am so seriously pissed off right now. I could bust a testicle.	[]
Other	11	0	And with that the Persian club owner came to a realization.	[]
Other	9	0	I shall have to deal with these lesbos myself.	[]
Other	27	0	Girls, I just want to say that I am very proud of you. The way we kept those Persians from takin' over our bar was Les-tastic.	[]
Other	20	0	Well that's great, Janet, but what now? We can't just stay here pushing them away our whole lives.	[]
Other	9	0	We can't? I think it's pretty fun.	[]
Other	15	0	We have to have a more solid plan. Something we can use against them permanently.	[]
Other	11	0	Maybe we can dig up some dirt on the club owner.	[]
Other	14	0	Hey, that's a great idea, Betsy. We need somebody working on the inside.	[]
Other	2	0	Whattaya mean?	[]
Other	24	0	If we could get some Persians on our side, we could send them in to try to dig up some dirt on the owner!	[]
Other	15	0	But who's gonna spy on them for us? We don't know any Persians.	[]
Other	14	0	It's okay. There's people you can hire for this kind of thing.	[]
Other	9	0	Que paso? Que paso? Looking for work? Si? Trabajo?	[]
Other	1	0	Yeis.	[]
Other	4	0	We looking work, si.	[]
Other	21	0	All right. We need you to infiltrate some Persians who run Club Persh. And dig up some dirt on the owner.	[]
Other	1	0	Okay.	[]
Other	1	0	Sure.	[]
Other	1	0	Okay.	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Other	11	0	Janet, how is this gonna work? They don't look Persian.	[]
Other	22	0	Sure they do.  Just have to- gel the hair, put on a silk shirt, some gold chains, and tons of cologne.  Persian.	[]
Other	1	0	Si.	[]
Other	1	0	Wow!	[]
Other	22	0	All right, Mexicans, take the rest of these outfits and see what you can find out. The address is in there too.	[]
Other	1	0	Okay.	[]
Other	2	0	No problem.	[]
Other	1	0	Yes.	[]
Other	1	0	Si.	[]
Other	11	0	And Mexicans, please hurry. Our girl bar has very little time.	[]
Other	86	0	A full day passed, and the Lesbos knew a second Persian attack was imminent. Outside, Lesbo lookouts kept watch, ready to alert the others. The Lesbo leader sat nervously inside. Her plan to dress Mexicans as Persians to act as spies - perhaps it had failed. She looked around at her fellow Lesbos. They were tired. In order to keep her Lesbos awake, she had no choice: she would have to make coffee.  With fresh coffee brewed, the Lesbos found new life, but would it be enough?	[]
Other	5	0	The Persians are attacking again!	[]
Other	3	0	Take positions, Lesbos!	[]
Other	2	0	Get outside!	[]
Other	12	0	No wait, wait! That's not the Persians, it's the Mexicans.	[]
Other	1	0	Really?	[]
Other	4	0	How can you tell?	[]
Other	6	0	Let them through. It's okay.	[]
Other	3	0	Hola, como estas?	[]
Other	1	0	Hola.	[]
Other	10	0	Did you uncover anything? Are the Persians doing anything illegal?	[]
Other	8	0	Ahh, no. They're not doing anything illegal.	[]
Other	4	0	A-are you sure?	[]
Other	15	0	No, but we did find out a kind of secret about the person in charge.	[]
Other	11	0	What secret?!  Oh my God, are, are you sure about this?	[]
Other	1	0	Si.	[]
Other	16	0	Janet! Janet, the Persian boss is here. He wants to talk to you and you alone.	[]
Other	15	1	It's okay. It's time I met this rich Persian asshole face to face.	['asshole']
Other	7	0	Why are you lesbians being so difficult?	[]
Other	9	0	Because we're protecting the only home we have.	[]
Other	13	0	I don't know why you have to be all superlame about this.	[]
Other	31	0	You know, a long time ago when I first realized I was a lesbian, I felt isolated, confused. And finally I found a place that accepts me for who I am.	[]
Other	18	0	Okay, how about this?  I will make you the manager of Club Persh. You'll make good money.	[]
Other	23	0	That's a generous offer, Xerxes, but you see, there's something I know about you.  I know you're actually a woman.	[]
Other	7	0	How..? How did you find that out?	[]
Other	14	0	I hired Mexicans to spy on you! They saw you working out at Curves.	[]
Other	18	0	You don't understand. Women can't be the boss in Persian culture. Nobody can know about this.	[]
Other	35	1	Yeah. And you know why? Because men are all assholes! They make you feel ashamed for being a little... big, or, manly looking.  But not Lesbos. We accept other women for who they are inside!	['assholes']
Other	3	0	You do? Seriously?	[]
Other	11	0	Have you never... even thought, of being with another woman before?	[]
Other	20	0	No. I don't even know how two women... can make love. Unless they just kind of  scissor or something.	[]
Other	5	0	Ohh yeah! Scissor me, Xerxes!	[]
Other	5	0	Ohh, that feels so supercool!	[]
Other	2	0	Yeah, scissor!	[]
Other	6	0	Ohh, I'm a new woman!	[]
Other	26	2	And so it was that Les Bos was saved. The Persians had agreed to keep it a lesbian bar, for no dyke should be without cocktails.	['dyke', 'cocktails']
Other	4	0	Thanks for everything, Xerxes.	[]
Other	4	0	No. Thank you, friend.	[]
Other	11	0	Hey, aren't you supposed to be teaching school right now?	[]
Other	9	0	The school hired a substitute to cover for me.	[]
Other	20	0	Hand so to find the sum of the two fractions, zhyou must always first check for the lowest common denominator.	[]
Other	1	0	Si.	[]
Other	7	0	Si. Si. Yes. Yes. That's right.	[]
Other	1	0	Si.	[]
Stan	5	0	These guys are pretty good.	[]
Kyle	8	0	Yeah. I think I'm actually learning something.	[]
