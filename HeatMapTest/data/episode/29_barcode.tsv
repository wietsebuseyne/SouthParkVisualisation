Stan	9	0	Please, I don't wanna go back with them.	[]
Other	9	0	But Stan, your mother and father are out there!	[]

Other	10	0	All right, kid, you can come. Now, let's go.	[]
Other	8	0	Stan, I wanna talk to you about family.	[]
Stan	1	0	What?!	[]
Other	1	0	What?!	[]
Other	60	0	You see, I had a family once. At least, I called them my family. Really, they were nothin' but a gang of people I thought were my friends. Ah after we killed a bunch of people together, I realized that my real family was who took care of me, and who took the time to care about what I did.	[]
Stan	13	0	But they don't care about me, they just want to punish me.	[]
Other	15	0	If they don't care about you, would they have driven nine hours to Nebraska?	[]
Stan	8	0	I guess you're right, Uncle Charlie. Thanks.	[]

Other	9	0	You're going back to prison to rot, Manson!	[]
Other	4	0	Good! I deserve to!	[]
Other	1	0	What??	[]
Other	29	0	I can never make it up to the families that I destroyed, but at least I'll make an example for anyone else thinking that crime  is an answer.	[]
Other	2	0	Stop that.	[]
Other	41	0	You see, I get it now! I finally understand what the holidays are all about. Boys, don't you see? You can't let things get you down during the holidays, because being happy is what the holidays are all about!	[]
Kyle	15	0	Charlie's right! I'm not gonna let some fake Mr. Hankey spoil my holidays.	[]
Other	92	1	I've been such a bastard all these years, and I finally understand. And it it it feels great! If I feel like- I feel like I'm in my own Christmas special. You see... Holidays are that special time When we laugh and sing and feel warm and cozy Forget about being angry for a day  Remember how it felt to be a child Opening presents on Christmas mornin'  That's the way that we should all feel now So I say Happy happy happy happy holy happy happy happy Holidays	['bastard']

Stan	8	0	I hope you can forgive me, too, Mom.	[]
Other	16	0	Oh, Stanley. Let's just forget the whole thing and have a nice holiday back home.	[]
Stan	1	0	Really?	[]
Randy	8	0	Sure. We'll punish you after the holidays.	[]
Stan	6	0	Hooray! Uh, I mean, wait. What?	[]
Other	32	0	And so, Manson is hauled off to jail to rot in his cell. Everything is back to normal, and I guess the only thing left to say is, God bless us, everyone.	[]
Other	96	0	And I guess that's what I've learned. I'm sorry for what I did, but that doesn't make up for it. I deserve to be in jail. All I hope is that I don't make mankind lose faith in itself. Yes, there's murderers in the world. There's rapists and thieves. But those are the vast minority. The majority of mankind is made up of caring people, who try every day to do what they think is right. And that's the spirit of the season. What do you think, guys?	[]
Other	8	0	It sucks, just like all your other books.	[]
Other	8	0	Well, Guh Good night, you guys. Happy Holidays.	[]
Other	2	0	Shut up!	[]
Other	5	0	What was that?  What the?!	[]
Other	40	0	Merry Christmas, Charlie Manson!  Hark, the herald angels sin, Glory to the newborn King Peace on earth, and mercy mild God and sinners reconciled Joyful all ye nations rise Join the triumph of the skies Hark, the herald angels sing	[]
Stan	8	1	Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.	['fucked']
