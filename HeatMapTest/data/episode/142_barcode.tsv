Randy	20	0	A cartoon...! A cartoon is about to air on American television with... with the Muslim prophet Mohammad as a character!	[]
Stan	1	0	Sso?	[]
Randy	26	0	SO?! Stanley, Mohammad is sacred to the Muslim people.  Ever since those cartoon in Denmark, the rules have changed. Nobody shows an image of Mohammad anymore.	[]
Other	17	0	Which cartoon is it? What cartoon'll be so insensitive as to have Mohammad as a character?	[]
Randy	18	0	Who do you think?! The cartoon that's always pushing buttons with their careless toilet humor! Family Guy!	[]
Other	1	0	AWWW!	[]
Other	6	0	How could Family Guy do that?	[]
Other	8	0	Why would Family Guy so blatantly insult Muslims?	[]
Randy	16	0	Because Family Guy doesn't care who they insult! They only care about their... precious money!	[]
Stan	17	0	Oh come on, people. You really think anybody's gonna be that pissed off about a cartoon??	[]
Mr. Mackey	7	0	Wu-we've got the TV working!	[]
Other	17	0	Once again, a cartoon depicting the Muslim prophet Mohammad is set to air tonight on Family Guy!	[]
Other	4	0	Oh Randy, hold me.	[]
Other	34	0	The news has already sparked a shockwave of protests throughout the Muslim world.  All over the Middle East, Muslims are burning American flags and Family Guy posters. Muslim terrorist al-Zawahri made this statement:	[]
Other	29	0	We are so super pissed off at 'Family Guy'. 'Family Guy' isn't even that funny of a show. A jihad on 'Family Guy', and the 'Family Guy' nation!	[]
Other	4	0	So what happens now?	[]
Randy	31	0	We stay here through the night, wait it out to see if they do anything. If we're still alive in the morning,  then we'll know we're not dead.	[]
Other	3	0	It's okay!	[]
Randy	6	0	We're alive?? We're alive!	[]
Other	14	0	Everyone. Everyone, listen. FOX Network censored the image of Mohammad at the last minute.	[]
Other	3	0	Oh thank God.	[]
Randy	9	0	Well, it looks like we've dodged a bullet.	[]
Stan	7	0	They censored the image of Mohammad? How?	[]
Kyle	15	0	I TIVO every episode. We can go to my house and see what they did.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Okay you guys, check it out.	[]
Cartman	7	0	You TIVO every episode of Family Guy?	[]
Kyle	6	0	Dude, it's a good show.	[]
Stan	7	0	Yeah, lots of people like Family Guy.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Yich.	[]
Other	15	0	Peter, I can't believe you invited your old high-school sweetheart over for dinner.	[]

Other	12	0	Yeah, but Dad, why would you invite an ex-girlfriend to dinner?	[]

Other	7	0	Well, maybe we can just have tea.	[]
Other	16	0	You mean like the time you had tea with Mohammad, the prophet of the Muslim faith?	[]
Other	8	0	Come on, Mohammad, let's get some tea.	[]
Other	5	0	Try my Mr. T. ...tea.	[]
Other	19	0	Oh boy, was that ever weird. Anyway, I can't believe I invited my old sweetheart to dinner. Huh.	[]
Kyle	8	0	That's it? That's all they did?	[]
Cartman	11	0	Oh man, that's not cool! Seriously, that is not cool.	[]
Stan	6	0	What? What's the big deal?	[]
Cartman	36	0	What's the big deal? You guys, they just made fun of the religion of an entire group of people.  What, you guys think that's okay?! Do you care at all about people's feelings?!	[]
Kyle	12	0	Since when you care about being sensitive to people's religion, Cartman?!	[]
Stan	10	0	Yeah, you rip on people's religion all the time!	[]
Cartman	39	1	That's different! I'm just a little boy! That's a cartoon! Millions of people watch it! How would you feel, Kyle, if there was a cartoon on television that made fun of Jews all the time?! Huh?!	['jews']
Kyle	1	0	Uhhh...	[]
Cartman	14	0	I'm telling you guys, it's wrong! It's WRONG!!  It's wrong!	[]
Other	6	0	Kyle? Kyle, what are you watchi-?!	[]
Other	15	0	Hey Brian, this is like the time I got a job as a carrot cake.	[]
Other	9	0	Gaaah! It's Family Guy! Quick, Gerald, do something!	[]
Kyle	4	0	Dad, Dad, Jesus Christ!	[]
Other	6	0	It's okay... it's dead.	[]
Other	12	0	You boys know you're not supposed to watch that careless show!	[]
Kyle	13	0	Mom, it was nothing. Mohammad just stood there and then drank some tea.	[]
Other	16	0	You boys don't understand anything! It's obvious that you ALL need Muslim-sensitivity training!	[]
Other	30	0	Welcome to Muslim-Sensitivity Training. It is important for us to understand why the Muslim feel the way they do, and why we can never show an image of Mohammad.	[]
Kyle	9	0	No, Muslims can't show an image of Mohammad.	[]
Other	7	0	Kyle, you're not being very sensitive.	[]
Cartman	15	0	Yeah, Kyle. Maybe you think this is funny, but the rest of us don't.	[]
Other	146	4	Let's all look at why Muslims are upset:  First of all, in the Muslim religion, you're not allowed to have what?  Sex. Good.  There's no sex until marriage in the Muslim world.  Now, this would be fine except that in the Muslim religion you also can't... Anybody?  Jack off.  Okay, jacking it is strictly forbidden in the Muslim religion.  And what do we know about the places Muslims live? They live in?  Good, sand.  Now put yourself in the shoes of a Muslim. It's Friday night, but you can't have sex, and you can't jack off. There's sand in your eyes and probably in the crack of your ass, and then some cartoon comes along from a country where people are getting laid, and mocks your prophet. Well you know what? I'd be pretty pissed off too!	['sex', 'sex', 'sex', 'ass']
Cartman	23	0	Mrs. Garrison, that is ignorant and racist! Muslims are mad because of Family Guy, not because they can't jack off! Right, Wendy?	[]
Wendy	1	0	...yeah.	[]
Mr. Mackey	12	0	Attention students: Proceed to the school gymnasium immediately for an emergency announcement!	[]
Stan	6	1	The hell's going on now?!	['hell']
Other	4	0	Shh! Quiet, students, quiet!	[]
Other	33	0	Once again: we have just learned that the Family Guy episode featuring Mohammad was only Part 1 of a two-parter! And Part 2 is going to air next week, with Mohammad uncensored!	[]
Cartman	1	0	What?	[]
Other	3	0	Why would they-?	[]
Other	27	0	FOX Studios claims that the Family Guy writing staff has demanded the Mohammad character be seen in full view.  The head of FOX had this to say:	[]
Other	20	0	Family Guy is our biggest show. If they insist we don't censor their work, then we we can't.	[]
Randy	7	2	FAMILY GUY!!!  I DAMN YOU TO HELL!!!	['damn', 'hell']
Other	24	0	Once again, bitter riots have started in the Middle East; this time, even more massive. And terrorist leader al-Zawahri has issued a threat	[]
Other	29	0	Seriously, 'Family Guy' isn't even that well written. The jokes are all interchangeable and usually irrelevant to the plot. When this episode airs-our retaliation will be MASSIVE!!!!	[]
Mr. Mackey	6	0	Retaliation... Oh my God. M'kay?	[]
Cartman	17	1	Goddamned Family Guy! Now they're just provoking people! It's like they want a holy war!	['goddamned']
Stan	10	0	Does this mean we don't have school all week?	[]
Cartman	10	0	You guys, this is serious! We have to do something!	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Like what?)	[]
Cartman	26	0	We have to go to the FOX network in L.A. We have to go and... try to get that episode pulled. You guys with me?	[]
Stan	15	0	Dude, we can't go anywhere. They've shut down the airports and the buses.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Then we'll ride our Big Wheels.	[]
Stan	3	0	To Los Angeles?	[]
Cartman	23	0	If that's what it takes, yes! We have to talk to the network! The Family Guy writers aren't gonna back down!	[]
Kyle	21	0	Well good for them. They shouldn't! The writers are standing up and saying they aren't going to be intimidated!	[]
Cartman	10	0	Intimidated?! Is that what you think this is about, Kyle?	[]
Kyle	27	1	All right dude, what the hell has gotten into you?! I don't trust for one second that your sudden concern for the Muslim people is real!	['hell']
Cartman	88	0	All right, fine, Kyle. Forget the Muslim faith for a minute. People can get hurt. If ten people die because Family Guy just had to have their little joke, will you still think it's funny?  What if a hundred people died? Will it be funny then, Kyle?  I'm going to Los Angeles. I'm gonna do whatever I can to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand. Somebody has to speak for the Muslim people. Somebody has to speak for what's right.	[]
Other	12	0	Kyle! Kyle, wake up!  We have to go! The terrorists are attacking!	[]
Kyle	7	0	Dad? Are you sure there's time?	[]
Other	14	0	This isn't a joke, Kyle! Bombs have already gone off in six cities!	[]
Kyle	1	0	No!	[]
Other	6	0	Wait a minute!  Where's Ike?!	[]
Other	5	0	He was just here! Ike!	[]
Other	1	0	Ike!	[]
Kyle	3	0	Ike? Iiike!  Ike!	[]
Ike	5	0	Ice cream. I want chocolate.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Ike!  This way!  Iiike!	[]
Ike	1	0	Kyyyle!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Nooooo!	[]
Cartman	11	0	Come to try and stop me?!  It isn't gonna work.	[]
Kyle	25	0	I didn't come to stop you. I... I think you're right, Cartman. I want to help you get the Family Guy episode pulled.	[]
Cartman	17	0	Yeah well, I don't need a partner on this.  Especially one who doesn't trust me.	[]
Kyle	36	0	Look, Cartman, I don't know what's gotten into you, but... I I think it's pretty amazing. And I think it's real. You have to understand why I didn't believe you before.	[]
Cartman	35	0	Yeah. I do understand, Kyle. I've been doing the wrong things for a long time. Doing things for my own selfish reasons. I just wanna do something right, you know? Just this one time.	[]
Kyle	20	0	It's a long trip, dude. You're gonna need help. We can try and get the episode pulled together.	[]
Cartman	11	0	You know we might not even make it into the studio.	[]
Kyle	26	0	I know. But just like you, I feel like I have to try. People can really get hurt, and a joke just isn't worth that.	[]
Cartman	7	0	So what made you change your mind?	[]
Kyle	9	0	I got some sound advice... from an old friend.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Well Kyle, we'd better get going.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Cartman	3	0	Are you set?	[]
Kyle	7	0	I'm set! Let's do this!	[]
Cartman	5	0	All right, let's roll!	[]
Other	8	0	People! People, quiet, please!  We must not panic!	[]
Randy	18	0	Well what are we gonna do, Mayor?! Part 2 of the Family Guy episode airs in six days!	[]
Other	14	0	I believe that Professor Thomas from the University has come up with a solution.	[]
Other	70	0	Thank you, Mayor.  Now look, everyone, Muslim terrorists and extremists are threatening us for what Family Guy is going to do... because they've wrongly grouped us together. Our only hope is to make the Muslim extremists know... that we had no part in the Mohammad episode. That even though the episode aired, we didn't watch it, we didn't hear it, and we didn't talk about it.	[]
Other	6	0	So how do we do that?	[]
Other	96	0	We bury our heads. In sand.  We take twenty to twenty-five dump trucks, fill them with sand from Monarch Lake, and then dump the sand along South Park Avenue. By using approximately eighteen dozen shovels, we can each dig a hole in the sand, stick our heads in the holes, and then have the person to our left bury them. If we can manage to get every person's head buried deep, deep in sand before the Mohammad episode airs, we could avoid looking like we're responsible for any part of this at all.	[]
Other	134	0	No, no, wait a minute,  that's ridiculous.  What we need to do is just the opposite. Freedom of speech is at stake here, don't you all see?  If anything, we should ALL make cartoons of Mohammad, and show the terrorists and the extremists that we are all united in the belief that every person has a right to say what they want! Look, people, it's... been real easy for us to stand up for free speech lately. For the past few decades we haven't had to risk anything to defend it. But those times are going to come! And one of those times is right now. And if WE... aren't willing to RISK... what we have, then we just believe in free speech, but we don't defend it.	[]
Randy	5	0	I like the sand idea.	[]
Mr. Mackey	3	0	Yeah, me too.	[]
Other	8	0	Yeah. The sand thing sounds a lot simpler.	[]
Other	16	0	We're gonna need eight dozen shovels and sixteen tons of sand! Let's move, people!	[]
Kyle	30	0	We got six days to make it to Los Angeles. If we keep our stops to a minimum, we should be able to get the episode pulled just in time.	[]
Cartman	17	0	Yes, and in just a few weeks from now, Family Guy will be off the air forever.	[]
Kyle	16	0	Off the air? But... we're just going to try to get the Mohammad episode pulled.	[]
Cartman	77	0	It's simple television economics, Kyle. All it takes to kill a show forever is get one episode pulled. If we convince the network to pull this episode for the sake of Muslims, then the Catholics can demand a show they don't like get pulled. And then people with disabilities can demand another show get pulled. And so on and so on, until Family Guy is no more! It's exactly what happened to Laverne & Shirley.	[]
Kyle	28	0	Whoa whoa wait a minute!  This isn't what I signed up for! I like Family Guy. Why do we have to get it off the air forever?	[]
Cartman	12	0	Because they made f-fun of Muslims, and and that's wrong.	[]
Kyle	26	0	But that doesn't mean it has to go off the air. You should like that show. Your sense of humor is just like Family Guy.	[]
Cartman	31	0	Don't you EVER, EVER, compare me to Family Guy! You hear me Kyle??!! Compare me to Family Guy again, and so help me I will kill you where you stand!	[]
Kyle	28	1	You unbelievable son of a bitch. You never cared about the Muslim religion. Or the safety of people in America. You just want Family Guy off the air!	['bitch']
Cartman	68	0	Do you have any idea what it's like?! Everywhere I go, Hey Cartman, you must like Family Guy, right? Hey, your sense of humor reminds me of Family Guy, Cartman.  I am NOTHING like Family Guy! When I make jokes, they are inherent to a story! Deep, situational and emotional jokes based on what is relevant and has a POINT! Not just one interchangeable joke after another!!	[]
Kyle	5	0	What are you talking about?!	[]
Cartman	4	0	YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!	[]
Kyle	24	0	I can't believe I let you scare me into taking your side. You used fear to make me stop believing in free speech.	[]
Cartman	22	0	Well... I guess you won't be helping me now. No biggie. I don't NEED you to get the episode pulled!	[]
Kyle	30	0	No!  I am NOT letting you go to that television studio and pretend... to care about safety and sensitivity to get a show you don't like off the air!	[]
Cartman	13	0	Well then Kyle, I guess we- ...Oh my God, is that Tim McGraw?	[]
Kyle	2	0	What?  CARTMAN!	[]
Cartman	3	0	Kyle, stop it!	[]
Cartman	2	1	Holy Crap!	['crap']
Kyle	1	0	Ahhh!	[]

Other	18	0	If you have children, be sure to bury their heads in the sand before you bury your own.	[]
Stan	11	0	Dad, I don't wanna bury my head in the sand.	[]
Randy	13	0	It's the best say, Stanley. Did you eat your Fruit Roll-Up?	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Randy	17	0	All right, make sure your snorkel is working.  All right, now get your head in the hole.	[]
Stan	4	0	Dad, this is stupid.	[]
Randy	16	0	Stanley, there's no time for your immaturity! Do it!  All right Sharon, now do me.	[]
Other	31	0	Uh Professor, we all just thought of somethin'. If everyone has their head buried by the person standing to their left, then who's gonna bury the last person's head?	[]
Other	21	0	Yes. I'm afraid one person is going to have to be last, and... not have his head in the sand.	[]
Other	4	0	I'll do it.	[]
Other	2	0	Dylan, no!	[]
Other	21	0	You realize by not burying your head in sand, you'll appear to be a part of the Family Guy audience.	[]
Other	3	0	Yes, I know.	[]
Other	5	0	Dylan, please, you can't!	[]
Other	32	0	Somebody has to do it, Sarah.  You run along now and you get your head in the sand. I'll be all right.  You have to understand... I'm all she has.	[]

Kyle	3	0	No!  AAAAH!  AAAAH!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Hahahaha! So long, Kyle!	[]

Other	3	0	Yes, Mr. President.	[]
