Butters	7	0	Why are they gonna kill my parents?	[]

Other	6	0	This is stupid. I'm leaving!	[]
Cartman	8	0	Nobody is going anywhere until the police arrive!	[]
Other	2	0	Screw you!	[]
Cartman	3	0	Shoot him, Butters!	[]
Butters	1	0	No!	[]
Cartman	24	0	You have to shoot him, Butters! He's gonna warn all the Chinese and they're gonna kill your parents! Do it! Do it!	[]
Butters	1	0	Waah!	[]
Other	5	0	Ow! A-Ah! A-Ooowww!	[]
Cartman	8	1	Aw dude, you shot him in the dick.	['dick']
Butters	1	0	Huh?	[]
Cartman	14	1	That's not cool Butters. You don't shoot a guy in the dick.	['dick']
Butters	11	0	But I was just trying to stop him, and you said-	[]
Cartman	35	2	It doesn't matter, Butters! You never shoot a guy in the dick. Everyone knows that! Shooting a guy in the dick? That's just, that's just weak. I can't believe you, Butters.	['dick', 'dick']
Kyle	24	1	My name is Kyle Broflovski. My friend was raped last Memorial Day weekend. And, and I  I'm gonna help prosecute the men responsible.	['raped']
Other	15	0	You want to bring Steven Spielberg and George Lucas to trial for raping Indiana Jones.	[]
Kyle	42	0	I know that I'll have to testify, that I'll have to... relive what I saw that day.  But I can't let Spielberg and Lucas get away with it. Not this time. Even if I have to do it alone.	[]
Stan	4	0	You aren't alone.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Stan?	[]
Stan	16	0	We'll all testify. We can't let them ever do this again.  I love you.	[]
Kyle	4	0	I love you too.	[]
Other	10	0	Uh kids, kids, I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous.	[]
Stan	2	0	Wh-why?	[]
Other	23	1	You don't have a case here. You can't really say that Spielberg and Lucas raped Indiana Jones in the new film.	['raped']
Kyle	4	0	Did you see it?	[]
Other	15	0	Yes I saw it, but I-  But I just try not to think about it.	[]
Stan	10	0	Then you saw what Lucas and Spielberg did to him!	[]
Other	39	0	I don't know what I saw!  All right?! I mean, it wa-it was dark in the theater... I mean... yeah, things got a little out of hand with the plot... the third act took too long, uh-	[]
Kyle	5	0	Indy deserved more than that!	[]

Cartman	22	0	Shaddup! These American traitors might have bought your propaganda, but not us!  Oh, thank God, the police are here! We're safe!	[]
Other	12	0	You with the gun, step out or we will fire upon you.	[]
Cartman	26	0	No no, you got it wrong. We aren't the Chinese, we're the good gu-  AAH!  Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!	[]
Butters	1	0	Uhwhat?	[]
Cartman	45	1	One of the cops is Chinese! Son of a bitch, how high up does this thing go? We can't trust anybody here, Butters!  Don't come any closer! We have information that that we will only trust with the President of the United States!	['bitch']
Other	2	0	The President?	[]
Other	9	0	All right men, come on. We're going in.	[]
Cartman	20	1	No! God damn it we're serious! We'll only talk to the President! Stop! Fire a warning shot, Butters!	['damn']
Other	4	0	Ow! Ah, o-ow!	[]

Cartman	31	3	What the hell is wrong with you?! That is not cool, Butters! That is not cool!  You don't fucking do that! You don't shoot a guy in the dick!	['hell', 'fucking', 'dick']
Butters	5	0	Well okay, I'm sorry!	[]
Cartman	26	2	...It's not okay! Defeating the Chinese won't mean anything if we do it by going around shooting people in the dick!  God damn it!	['dick', 'damn']
Other	23	0	It's all right there in front of you, Detective. Five sworn statements from these... brave boys. It's now up to you.	[]
Other	15	1	Are you nuts?! I'm not going out and arresting Steven Spielberg and George Lucas!	['nuts']
Stan	5	1	But they raped Indiana Jones!	['raped']
Kyle	21	0	I know it's hard to think about, but you have to be strong. Remember how that movie made you feel.	[]
Other	5	0	I didn't see it.	[]
Other	9	0	...You didn't see the new Indiana Jones movie?	[]
Other	14	0	No! I don't think anybody here saw it. Did you, Mitch?  Mitch? Mitch?	[]
Other	22	0	Well well, Indiana Jones. What you doin' in our neck of the woods?  Now let's see you just drop them pants!	[]

Cartman	47	0	No no! You listen to me! I have Chinese attackers here! And Chinese supporters! If I go outside, there are more Chinese ready to take me down! Defending America is all that matters, Mr. President! And I will stop at nothing! You understand that I  What happened?!	[]
Butters	16	0	They uh tr-tried to come in through the roof! They were gonna take the gun.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Good! Did you kill him?	[]
Butters	3	0	Uh, not exactly.	[]
Other	5	0	Ow. Oh, it stings. Ohhhh.	[]
Butters	8	0	Well it's not where I aimed, honest.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Dude...	[]
Butters	6	0	I seriously didn't mean it.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Dude!  You know what, Butters? You know what? Forget it.	[]
Butters	7	0	What? Uh where are you going, Eric?	[]
Cartman	23	0	You can just deal with the Chinese invasion yourself if that's how you're gonna do it, Butters! I'm out, man.	[]
Butters	5	0	By, by my, by myself?	[]
Cartman	40	1	I didn't sign up for this! You take your American Liberation Front and you shove it up your ass.  That's it. Kill me. Do whatever. I can no longer conscionably be a part of the American Liberation Front.	['ass']
Other	3	0	Go inside! Move!	[]
Other	15	0	George Lucas and Steven Spielberg! We have a warrant for your arrest!  Break it in!	[]
Other	2	0	My God.	[]
Other	20	1	Heey, what, what the hell are you doin' here?!  You've got nothin' on us! Seven hundred million box office!	['hell']
Other	4	1	Hm this is bullshit!	['bullshit']
Other	2	0	Weeee! Weeee!	[]
Other	4	0	Boys, we got 'em.	[]
Kyle	1	0	What?	[]
Other	13	0	Spielberg and Lucas, they were... raping a Stormtrooper when the police broke in.	[]
Other	24	1	And they found the dead raped bodies of Yoda and Short Round in their closet.  They'll never be free to do this again.	['raped']
Stan	3	0	So, what now?	[]
Other	17	0	Do you think things can ever go back to n-n-n, n-no, normal after this?	[]
Clyde	4	0	What do we do?	[]
Kyle	14	0	We live. That's what Indy would have wanted. We just try... to live.	[]
Other	13	0	Everyone just stay where you are until we can sort this all out.	[]
Other	14	0	There's nothing to sort out! These kids need to be put in jail!	[]
Other	11	0	We're going to search everyone and get statements! And the-	[]
Other	8	0	Sir! Sir, it's over. They got 'em.	[]
Other	2	0	Got who?	[]
Other	15	0	Spielberg and Lucas, they... finally got them for what they did to Indiana Jones, sir.	[]
Other	4	0	Hohhh, they got them.	[]
Other	6	0	They got 'em. It's over.	[]

Other	5	0	It's over its over.	[]
Other	3	0	I love you.	[]
Other	4	0	I love you too.	[]
Butters	10	0	So wait. That's it? What about the Chinese invasion?	[]
Cartman	80	2	I really don't care anymore, Butters. You see, I've learned something today. As Americans our fear of seeing another country become powerful can turn us into monsters. Watching how crazy you went. Watching you just... shoot people in the dick like that. It made me realize that I want America to be safe, but not at the cost of losing its dignity. I'd rather us be... Chinese... than a nation of unethical dickshooters.  You think about it.	['dick', 'dickshooters']
Butters	16	0	...Can't believe they put 'em in jail. And I thought that movie was pretty good.	[]
