Randy	10	0	The guys agree, Sharon: it could be a record holder.	[]
Other	11	1	Why are men so obsessed with how big their crap is?!	['crap']
Other	78	2	Guinness World Records America. How can I help you?  The biggest crap? We actually don't keep track of that record, sir.  Because we don't want to.  Look, we get calls from men all the time who believe they took the biggest crap, and we simply can't handle all the measuring and verification.  You need to call the European Fecal Standards and Measurements Office in Zurich.  You're welcome.  Jeez, another one.  Guinness World Records America.	['crap', 'crap']
Randy	18	1	Uhh yes, hello. My name is Randy Marsh, and I believe I took the world's biggest crap.	['crap']
Other	21	0	You need to call the European Fecal Standards and Measurements Office in Zurich. Their number is listed on their Web site.	[]
Other	18	1	Herr President, take a look at this.  It is a crap sent to us from the United States.	['crap']
Other	8	0	Very niiice.  Has it been checked for accuracy?	[]

Other	10	1	The current record is a crap weighing 7.5 Courics.	['crap']
Randy	3	0	But that means...	[]
Other	10	0	That's right. You are the new world's champion!	[]
Randy	13	0	Really?! Yuh, you mean, REALLY?!  Hey Stan! I uh- Hey Sharon! Hey everybody!	[]
Other	20	0	Well, I guess we'd better call the old champion and let him know his record has just been broken.	[]
Other	35	0	He has won twenty-two Grammy's, countless humanitarian awards, and is the only person ever to be nominated for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, and the Nobel Peace Prize. Ladies and gentlemen, Bono!	[]

Other	45	1	Hello everyone! I, am Bono.  For years it has been my honor to try and bring focus to the needs in Africa, and today, I have very exciting news. Last night, at twenty past eight, I took a crap weighing nine and a half Courics.	['crap']
Other	1	0	Whoa!	[]
Other	1	0	Bono?!	[]
Other	27	1	As you can see, it is one solid piece.  It is my biggest crap to date, and I swear to its authenticity. Thank you, and God bless.	['crap']
Other	17	1	You heard it, ladies and gentlemen! The official biggest crap is... 9.5 Courics! Congratulations to Bono!	['crap']
Other	4	0	Bo-no! Woo-ooo!	[]
Stan	8	0	Dad, um, I think dinner's almost ready.	[]
Randy	55	0	I almost did it. I almost made something of myself. You know, when you get real close, you start thinking that maybe your life is gonna matter.  I mean, this was something I made! Something that came from me! That was a part of me! The only thing I ever made that was any good!	[]
Stan	5	0	Gee, thanks a lot, Dad.	[]
Randy	24	0	You're welcome.  And I just,.. I know that this late in my life I'll never come so close to finally having ...meaning.	[]
Other	6	0	Come on guys, lasagna's ready.	[]
Randy	20	0	Oh. Lasagna's ready.  You hear that, Stan? Mom says lasagna... is ready! I can see through your sarcasm, Sharon!	[]
Other	5	0	What are you talking about?	[]
Randy	35	0	You can say it, Sharon! I know Bono's better than me! I'm sorry I'm not Bono, all right?! Sorry that I don't have... billions of dollars and a Nobel prize nomination!	[]
Other	4	0	Randy, this is ridiculous!	[]
Randy	30	0	Oh, that's real mature, Sharon! Just act like everything's funny! It's a big joke to you, isn't it?! Just a big joke!  Don't touch me!	[]
Other	13	1	Can you believe him?! All this over what guy took the biggest crap!	['crap']
Stan	10	0	You don't understand, Mom. You just don't understand.	[]
Other	2	0	Wha? Wha?	[]
Other	14	1	How come they just let that Bono guy send a picture of his crap?	['crap']
Other	7	0	'Cause he's Bono, that's why.	[]
Other	10	0	But he could have faked it. It isn't fair!	[]
Randy	15	0	Doesn't matter. He's got the record now; there's nothing I can do.	[]
Other	9	0	Oh yes there is! You could do it again!	[]
Randy	1	0	What?	[]
Other	22	1	Think about it: you weren't even trying to take the biggest crap last time. Imagine if you actually worked at it!	['crap']
Other	5	0	Hey. Hey that's right.	[]
Randy	13	0	Nooo. I can't go through all that again. It's too much.	[]
Other	13	1	Come on, Randy. I'll bet you can crap that big again easy!	['crap']
Other	13	0	With the right diet and training, who knows what you're capable of?	[]
Randy	19	1	Guys, forget it! It's over! It was a fluke crap; I'll never take one that big again!	['crap']
Other	60	2	Is it over, Randy?! We all saw that crap you took! That was no fluke! There's something inside you that made you able to do it! Randy, you have a gift. Now who knows why God chose you, but he did! And if you walk away now, you'll always... wonder... how big a crap you could have taken!	['crap', 'crap']
Randy	7	0	I would need a lot of help.	[]
Other	7	0	That's what we're here for.	[]
Other	7	0	Come on, Randy, what do you say?!	[]

Other	15	1	But first, the record for the world's biggest crap: will it again be broken?	['crap']
Other	1	0	Agh!	[]
Other	26	1	Randy Marsh of Colorado is now three weeks into his quest to make a new crap, spending nearly every waking hour at P.F. Chang's. .	['crap']
Other	4	0	Is this really newsworthy?	[]
Other	5	0	You just don't understand.	[]
Other	6	0	You're right. I don't.	[]
Other	37	0	At the same time, some people are questioning Bono's current record entry, saying nobody has ever seen it in person. Bono could not be reached for comment, as he is currently in Africa helping the needy.	[]
Other	2	0	Hello, hello.	[]
Other	13	0	Marsh is attempting to break the record again. We thought you should know.	[]
Other	10	0	He can't beat my nine and a half Courics!	[]
Other	6	0	Well he's going to try.	[]
Other	14	1	Fine, but he has to take the crap in front of you! In Zurich.	['crap']
Other	8	0	Bono, we've never had that rule before.	[]
Other	23	1	I's the only way you can know 'e's not cheating! If he doesn't crap in Zurich, it shouldn't count!	['crap']
Other	28	0	Ultrasound is very simple, Mr. Marsh. We're going to use harmless waves to look inside your belly. Just gonna put some warm gel on your stomach first.	[]
Randy	1	0	Oooooo.	[]
Other	25	1	Okay, take a deep breath.  I see the crap now. I can't say for sure, but I, I'd say is about... 14 Courics.	['crap']
Other	1	0	Fourteen?!	[]
Other	4	0	That's great, Randy!	[]
Randy	6	0	Can I, can I see it?	[]
Other	15	0	Sure. This is your colon, a-and here...  is the feces growing inside your belly.	[]
Randy	1	0	Ahhh...	[]
Other	21	1	Guys, we have a problem!  I talked to the EFSM and they say Randy has to take the crap in Zurich.	['crap']
Randy	2	0	In Zurich?	[]
Other	13	0	They say that Bono is demanding it and that their hands are tied.	[]
Other	27	1	I'm sorry Mr. Marsh, I I cannot condone you traveling on an airplane in your condition. It is never safe to fly during your turd trimester.	['turd']
Stan	8	0	Hi, could I speak with Mr. Bono, please?	[]
Other	8	0	Mr. Bono, you have a young gentleman caller!	[]
Other	11	0	Get the jet ready, Bovis! I've got to be going.	[]
Stan	17	1	Hi, my name is Stan Marsh. My dad's trying to beat your record for biggest crap.	['crap']
Other	10	0	Oh right. He can't make it to Zurich, right?	[]
Stan	31	1	That's kind of what I'm here for: Do you really need the biggest crap record? Could you maybe see your way to just... letting my dad have this one?	['crap']
Other	9	0	Let him have it? Why would I do that?!	[]
Stan	38	0	Look, you you gotta understand, sir. My dad's never won an award for anything. Ever. He doesn't have one single trophy. I mean, even I have a second-place trophy for most Sports Illustrated subscriptions sold.	[]
Other	8	0	I have the first-place trophy for that.	[]
Stan	44	1	Dude, don't you have enough? I mean, you got tons of money, a jet, and the biggest rock band in the world, a hot wife, and, you've been knighted. I mean, at some point, can't you just kind of... fuck off?	['fuck']
Other	13	0	I want people to know that I'm worth something. That I matter.	[]
Stan	25	0	All I'm asking is that maybe with this one thing, let my dad be number 1. A-and you can still be number 2.	[]
Other	4	0	Number two?! NUMBER TWO?!	[]
Stan	1	0	Agh!	[]
Other	16	0	Nobody calls me that anymore and gets away with it! Take it back! TAKE IT BACK!	[]
Stan	4	0	I take it back!	[]
Other	6	0	Say I'm not number two!	[]
Stan	5	0	You're not number two!	[]
Other	6	0	That's right! I'm not!	[]
Stan	6	0	What is wrong with that guy?	[]
Other	9	0	Your father is in grave danger. Come with me!	[]
Other	6	1	It must be quite a crap.	['crap']
Other	7	0	Come on, Randy. You have to push!	[]
Stan	13	0	What are you saying?! How do you know my dad is gonna die?!	[]
Other	10	1	Because nobody has ever taken a crap that big before!	['crap']
Stan	8	0	So Bono's newest record is a lie!	[]
Other	25	1	Look, I first knew something was wrong when I looked at Bono's first award for biggest crap. It said he took it in 1960.	['crap']
Stan	1	0	So?	[]
Other	47	2	So that's the year Bono was born. Then it all made sense to me. How could Bono be so talented, so caring, and yet seem like such a piece of crap? Because he is crap. Don't you get it? Bono is not the record holder...	['crap', 'crap']
Stan	4	0	He's the record.	[]
Other	1	0	Yes.	[]
Randy	10	0	I can't do it! I can't do it!	[]
Other	13	1	The crap is simply too big, Mr. Marsh. We must perform a Caesarean!	['crap']
Randy	6	0	But then, does it still count?	[]
Other	10	2	Oh no! The biggest crap means you crapped it out!	['crap', 'crapped']
Other	24	3	I believe that's true. We are sorry, Mr. Marsh, but, if you cannot crap out the crap, it's not really a crap.	['crap', 'crap', 'crap']
Randy	2	0	No... Nooo...	[]
Other	10	0	There there Randy, you... You gave it your best shot.	[]
Randy	6	0	I want my wife. Sharon? Sharon?	[]
Other	1	0	What?!	[]
Randy	17	1	I'm sorry, Sharon. Sorry that I let you down. Sorry I can't crap like Bono.	['crap']
Other	9	0	Well congratulations, Bono, it appears your record is intact.	[]
Other	7	0	I had a feeling it would be.	[]
Stan	16	2	Wait! Stop! Dad, your old crap counts. Bono never took a second crap to beat yours.	['crap', 'crap']
Other	5	0	Get him out of here!	[]
Other	7	0	What are you talking about, young man?	[]
Stan	17	0	Somebody's been keeping it a secret. Bono was never the record holder! He's the record!	[]
Other	11	0	It's not true! Kill the kid! I want him dead!	[]
Other	11	0	It's too late, Bono. The boy has learned the truth.	[]
Other	8	0	Herr Broloff, what do you know of this?	[]
Other	38	2	It's true, I'm afraid. You see, until Mr. Marsh came along, I was the record holder for the biggest crap. I took it back in 1960. It was the most amazing crap I'd ever taken.	['crap', 'crap']
Other	5	0	Poppa no! Say nothing more!	[]
Other	38	1	Come to me my... darling precious child.  After I had broken the record I took the crap home. I was so proud of it that I... decided to keep it, to try and raise it like a child.	['crap']
Other	4	0	No Poppa... No Poppa...	[]
Other	28	1	There there, my little crap.  Don't cry.  Here, do you want the biddy? Hm?  Does Bono want the biddy?  Yes, he likes the biddy doesn't he?	['crap']
Stan	1	0	Dude.	[]
Other	39	1	I kept the crap in my office, nursed it, fed it biddy. And soon biddy made him strong. Biddy made him grow up! Into one of the most influential figures of our time.  Easy Bono, that hurts the biddy.	['crap']
Other	1	0	Biddy.	[]
Other	33	1	My little crap has accomplished many things. But he could never shed the fact that he was really... a number two. So he spent his life trying to be number one, in everything.	['crap']
Stan	25	1	That's why he's able to do so much, try to help so many people, but still seem like such a piece of shit.	['shit']
Other	11	0	You have blemished this noble society's good name, Herr Broloff.	[]
Other	37	1	Have I?!  Look at the crap I took all those years ago! Bono is now almost six feet tall and over 80 Courics in weight! No matter how you look at it he IS still the record!	['crap']
Randy	27	1	Oh God, here it comes!  Ohhh hot hot hot hot! HOTTT hot hot hot hot hot! Hot! Hot!  Ho-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ot	['ho']
Other	2	0	My God...	[]
Other	7	0	It must be over a hundred Courics!	[]
Stan	5	0	Dad, are you all right?	[]
Randy	10	0	Yeah, I'm...  I'm good!  Feel a lot better.	[]
Other	21	0	Mr. Marsh, we apologize, and if it's okay with you, we would like to present you... your long overdue trophy.	[]
