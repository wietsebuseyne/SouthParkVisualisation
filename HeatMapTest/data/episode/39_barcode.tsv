Stan	10	0	I don't want to go to this stupid party!	[]
Randy	10	0	Come on, Stan, you're gonna have a great time.	[]
Stan	36	0	No, you guys are gonna have a great time! Whenever there's a party, the adults get to hang out and have fun while the kids spend the night locked in the basement eating stale pretzels.	[]
Randy	19	0	Well, your mom and I don't get out much, so you'll just have to bear through it.	[]
Mr. Mackey	10	0	Hello! Welcome, hmkay? This is already a wild party, hm.	[]
Randy	18	0	Yeah, well uh, sorry we had to bring the kid along. We had nowhere else to put him.	[]
Mr. Mackey	15	0	Oh, that's okay. I've got a special kids' room down in the basement.	[]
Stan	1	0	Awww!	[]
Mr. Mackey	20	0	Be sure to help yourselves to the crab souffle, and uh, eh, Juanita?  Juanita?  We need some more finger sandwiches?	[]
Stan	15	0	I don't wanna hang out in the kids' room. I won't know anybody	[]
Randy	42	0	Well, it would be good for you to make new friends. You can't just hang out with your buddy Kyle all the time. People will think you guys are, you know, funny. Now I bet you'll have a great time.	[]
Mr. Mackey	8	0	Here you go, it's right in here.	[]
Randy	9	0	We'll be upstairs if you need anything, Stan.	[]
Stan	12	0	Dad! You can't leave me here! These guys are total Melvins!	[]
Other	4	0	You have fun, Stanley.	[]
Stan	11	0	No! Mom, please! They're the geekiest kids at our school!	[]
Mr. Mackey	11	0	We'll come get you kids when the meteor shower starts.	[]
Other	14	0	Cheerio, Stahan. I do say it's quite a nice surprise seeing you here.	[]
Stan	3	0	Shut up, Pip.	[]

Stan	8	0	Butters, is there any way out of here?	[]
Butters	53	0	Nope. No way out. Buh, but there ain't nothin' upstairs but an old, stupid party anyways. It's better down here in the kids' room.  Uh, this here is Dougie. He's not too old, but he sure is a hoot to hang with. Uhuh, he's in first grade, I think.	[]
Other	3	0	I like math.	[]
Stan	3	0	Oh my God.	[]
Other	15	0	We were just playing a game called Wickershams and Ducklers. Do you want to play?	[]
Stan	1	0	No.	[]
Other	60	0	I'm the head Wickerknicker. And you are all little Wickershams  We all sing the merry tune of Stratford until I yell, Turrah! and then you all fall down laughing, and I join you, as I find it funny too. Stan, would you be the Wickersham of Brumble Briar?  And all right, here we go. Whippy-tippy tootoo, tralala-la.	[]
Other	10	0	Whippy-tippy tootoo, tralala-la. Whippy-tippy tootoo, tralala-la.	[]
Mr. Garrison	19	1	Great party, Mr. Mackey. Mr. Hat just grabbed Principal Victoria's ass.  No! Mr. Hat, you get back here!	['ass']
Mr. Mackey	12	0	Anyone for some meteor mai tai punch? It packs quite a wallop.	[]
Other	10	0	Oh, I'll pass. I don't drink hard alcohol.	[]
Mr. Mackey	13	0	Come on! Loosen up! Meteor showers only come once in a great while.	[]
Randy	15	0	One little drink isn't going to hurt anything, honey. Come on, live a little.	[]
Other	13	0	Well, it is kind of a special night. I guess I could... experiment.	[]
Randy	2	0	Yeah, experiment.	[]
Other	5	0	Whippy-tippy tootoo, tralala-la.	[]
Other	14	1	Wickersham tally-ho ugh.  Are you sure you don't want to play, Stanley?	['ho']

Other	5	0	What are you? A sourpuss?	[]
Butters	49	0	Uhuh, you uh really oughta play, Stan. It's an awfully fun game. Ah I've never been to England, but uh I'll bet the people there are really nice.  Are people nice in England, Pip? I bet they are, huh?  They got those thick noses and all.	[]
Other	4	0	Hey, look at this!	[]
Butters	15	0	Uh what is it? Is it something neat? Uh I wonder what it could be.	[]
Other	8	0	It's a box filled with ladies' clothes.	[]
Other	1	0	Neato.	[]
Butters	21	0	Hey, you know what we could do with these lady clothes, huh? Wuh-y why we could play Charlie's Angels.	[]
Stan	8	0	Oh, dude, you've gotta be kidding me.	[]
Other	10	0	Yes, let's! Can I be Jaclyn Smith? Can I?	[]
Butters	28	0	No, uh I get to be Jaclyn Smith. See, uh I thought of Charlie's Angels, and I get to be Jaclyn Smith 'cause I thought of it.	[]
Other	24	0	Oh, this sounds as much fun as Wickershams and Ducklers! Come on, Angels. Let's get dressed.  Which ladies' garments would you like, Stan?	[]
Stan	38	0	Dude, I'm not putting on ladies' clothes, and I'm not playing Charlie's Angels! You guys are Melvins, and I'm not one of you! So you go ahead and be Melvins, and leave me alone!	[]
Other	3	0	Well.  Alrighty then.	[]
Mr. Mackey	13	0	Here it is. I just had the hot tub put in last week.	[]
Other	2	0	Wow, neat!	[]
Other	4	0	It looks quite inviting.	[]
Mr. Mackey	14	0	Yeah, you can get a lot of action when you have a hot tub.	[]
Other	5	0	Oh Mr. Mackey, you nut.	[]
Randy	5	1	Hell, we should get in.	['hell']
Other	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Mr. Mackey	14	0	Sure, go ahead. It's a-it's a party, isn't it? Mkahy?	[]
Other	11	0	Oh, I'm not hot-tubbing. I have nothing to wear.	[]
Mr. Mackey	5	0	Hm huheh, that's okay.	[]
Other	5	0	No hot tub for me!	[]
Other	4	0	Well, screw you guys!	[]
Randy	9	0	I'm getting in for a while, too.  Geronimo!	[]
Other	15	0	Oh, look at our boys, Sheila.  It's just like they're in college again.	[]
Other	8	0	Okay, Angels, what's our mission this week?	[]
Butters	20	0	Well, I don't know what our mission is. Do you know what our mission is, little first-grade kid?	[]
Other	4	0	How should I know?	[]
Other	14	0	Oh, dear. We're Charlie's Angels, but we don't have a mission.	[]
Butters	28	0	Hey, that's because we need Bosley. Uh Bosley always told the Angels what their mission was. Remember Bosley? Wah uhwhy uhwhy we need somebody to be Bosley.	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Other	16	0	Well, we hate to trouble you, Stan, but would you mind terribly being Bosley for us?	[]
Stan	6	0	What do I have to do?	[]
Butters	31	0	Uh you just got- you just gotta tell us what our mission is, that's all. That's all Bosley does. Just give a mission, and us Angels will accomplish it.	[]
Stan	32	0	Alright, alright. Here's your mission. In ten minutes this room is gonna fill up with water and drown everybody. You have to find me a way out of this room, fast.	[]
Other	6	0	Oh, that's a splendid mission!	[]
Butters	28	0	Well, what are we waitin' for? We've gotta find a way out of this room, by golly, or else we're gonna get drowned. Come on, Angels!	[]
Other	5	0	Which Angel am I again?	[]
Randy	14	0	Oh boy, it's nice to have a night out without the kids, huh?	[]
Other	6	0	Yeah, I know what you mean.	[]
Randy	25	0	I love havin' a family and all. I just... miss being able to party. Drinking and socializing, and experimenting with all kinds of different things.	[]
Other	43	0	Well, that's what being young is all about. Once you have a family and a career, your experimenting days are over. But tonight is the exception; that's why I'm gonna smoke this cigar.  Only 'cause I've never smoked before.	[]
Randy	2	0	Good idea.	[]
Other	12	0	What haven't you tried that you've always wanted to try?	[]
Randy	21	0	Hohn.  Um, I don't know. Maybe I'll drink a few more beers and see where the party takes me.	[]
Other	5	0	Yeah! ...Was that your leg?	[]
Randy	5	0	Huh? Oh, you mean, this?	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Randy	5	0	Yeah. That, that was me.	[]
Other	2	0	Bosley! Bosley!	[]
Stan	2	0	What, Pip?	[]
Other	16	0	Oh no no no. My name is Sabrina Duncan. Remember? We're playing Charlie's Angels.	[]
Stan	6	1	What the hell do you want?!	['hell']
Other	11	0	Well, we've completed our mission. Jill found a way upstairs.	[]
Stan	2	0	You did?	[]
Other	2	0	Air shaft.	[]
Butters	37	0	Dougie pushed that big box out of the way and found this old ventilation duct. And I reckon it's got to lead somewhere, and and it's good 'cause, uh 'cause now we won't drown.	[]
Other	7	0	So Bosley, what's our next mission?	[]
Stan	4	0	We're going upstairs.	[]
Butters	19	0	Upstairs? Uhwhy why there's ain't nothin' upstairs but adults. Uhwhy would we want to go upstairs for?	[]
Stan	11	0	Because, you stupid Melvins, they have rad food and desserts upstairs!	[]
Randy	11	0	Hey, did you see Principal Victoria in there? She looks hot.	[]
Other	10	0	She sure does. I wouldn't mind takin' that home.	[]
Randy	11	0	O-hoh, yehah, I'm sure your wife would love that.	[]
Other	16	0	I wish. That's the one thing I've always thought of experimenting with. A threesome.	[]
Randy	6	0	With two girls or two guys?	[]
Other	16	0	Huh, well, two girls, of course! I mean ...with another guy, you know, that'd be...	[]
Randy	11	1	You, you never have a homosexual fantasy? Not that I have.	['homosexual']
Other	3	0	You haven't?	[]
Randy	14	0	No, I mean... Well, they say everybody has at some point, don't they?	[]
Other	25	1	Well, I never really wanted to experiment with anything too crazy. You know... maybe just... I don't know... masturbate in front of another guy.	['masturbate']
Randy	10	1	Yeah well, that, that's not really ...gay, is it?	['gay']
Other	8	0	NO, no, uh I don't think so.	[]
Randy	7	0	...Well it is a night for experimenting.	[]
Other	2	0	Sure is.	[]
Randy	4	0	Okay, I'll start.	[]
Other	17	0	This must be the place. They've got all kinds of crazy stuff going on in there.	[]
Other	12	0	Code 7. We believe we have found the compound. Request immediate backup.	[]
Other	9	0	Okay, so just what is going on here, people?	[]
Other	2	0	Get down!	[]
Other	1	0	What?	[]
Other	26	0	It's just like we told you, officer! There's a religious cult in there that plans to commit mass suicide when the meteor shower starts.	[]
Other	3	0	Are you sure?	[]
Other	24	0	Of course we're sure!  We're the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms! It's our job to know what these fanatics do!	[]
Other	14	0	So what does the ATF do when religious fanatics are gonna commit mass suicide?	[]
Other	24	0	Oh, don't worry! We won't let that happen! Even if it means we have to kill each and every one of them.	[]
Other	4	0	What's the situation?	[]
Other	23	0	Apparently, we've got at least five dozen men and women in there who intend to commit suicide when the meteor shower starts.	[]
Other	8	0	Any luck talking to somebody in the house?	[]
Other	19	0	We've tried calling, but there's no answer. I think we're gonna have to move in, sir.	[]
Other	2	0	Alright. Johnson!	[]
Other	1	0	Sir!	[]
Other	8	1	I'm sending you in. Watch your ass.	['ass']
Other	2	0	Yes, sir!	[]
Mr. Mackey	15	0	Oh, come on in. Join the party, mkay?  Would you like a meteor mai tai?	[]
Other	5	0	Heeey, I love mai tais!	[]
Other	6	0	We did it! Great job, Angels!	[]
Butters	20	0	So what's our mission now, huh Bosley? Uh wha what do you want us to do now, I wonder?	[]
Stan	16	0	Alright, Angels. Uh, your next job is to get Bosley some cookies and a TV set.	[]
Other	8	0	What kind of cookies do you want, Bosley?	[]
Stan	6	0	I don't care, just hurry!	[]
Butters	2	0	Well, hooray!	[]
Other	7	0	So uh. Well. That was certainly... interesting.	[]
Randy	1	0	...Yeah.	[]
Other	10	0	Uh, you don't regret doing it now, do you?	[]
Randy	31	2	No no. ...Wuh what's there to regret, right? I mean..., all we did was watch each other ...masturbate. That's that's not gay or anything. We said so, right?	['masturbate', 'gay']
Other	9	0	Thuh that's right. It's just harmless experimenting.	[]
Randy	14	0	Well, let's get back into the party and see what everyone is doing.	[]
Other	12	0	Hey.  Nothing changes between us, right? I mean, we're still friends.	[]
Randy	5	0	Um... Yeah yeah sure sure.	[]
Other	5	1	Damn it, where is Johnson?!	['damn']
Other	10	0	No communication, sir. It doesn't look good for him.	[]
Other	2	1	Those bastards!	['bastards']
Other	8	0	Great party, Mr. Mackey. Thank you so much.	[]
Mr. Mackey	10	0	Well, are you sure you have to leave so early?	[]
Other	11	0	We both have to be up early tomorrow, but thanks again.	[]
Mr. Mackey	4	0	Mkay. Drive carefully, mkay?	[]
Other	26	0	Hold it right there! Whatever it is you are intending to do, do not do it!  Your freaky religious cult will not succeed in its plan!	[]
Other	1	0	What?	[]
Other	21	1	Do not move, or we will be forced to shoot-  God damn it, who was that?!  Did you see them move?!	['damn']
Other	2	0	...I did.	[]
Other	1	0	Yah.	[]
Other	4	0	Yeah, they moved alright.	[]
Other	22	0	Well, I tell you what: we may not have Elway this year, but Brister won every game he started in last year.	[]
Other	17	0	Eh that's true, but Elway was the heart of the team. Who's the leader now?	[]
Other	16	0	I think the Jets are gonna be the team to beat this year in the AFC.	[]
Randy	14	2	Yeah. Hey uh, if you watch another guy masturbate, does that make you gay?	['masturbate', 'gay']
Other	1	0	...What??	[]
Randy	17	0	Well I just... I have this buddy, uh, he, sat and watched another guy ...play with himself.	[]
Other	7	1	Well... Let's go kick his ass!	['ass']
Other	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Other	3	0	Where is he?!	[]
Randy	7	0	Oh he, he lives in, like, Florida.	[]
Other	1	0	Aw!	[]
Other	6	0	Hey, Randy. What are you doing?	[]
Randy	9	0	Nothing. Uh. I'm gonna go get some chips.	[]
Other	5	0	Can I come with you?	[]
Randy	1	0	Okay.	[]
Butters	55	0	Come right on in here, Bosley. Huhwell, it was my idea.  Uh I got to thinkin', Wuh, where do people keep TV sets? and then I remembered that lots of grownups have TV's ih in their bedrooms. So, so I walked into Mr. Mackey's bedroom and er and sure enough, here it was.	[]
Stan	1	0	Rad!	[]
Other	16	0	Okay, Bosley, we got you cookies and a TV set. So what's our next mission?	[]
Stan	10	0	There are no more missions. I have everything I want.	[]
Butters	23	0	Wwe ain't got no more missions? Uhwhawhat are we supposed to do? We're Angels. Whawhat do Angels do without a mission?	[]
Stan	5	0	Just... play something else! God!	[]
Other	6	0	Oh dear. We've angered Bosley.	[]
Other	24	0	Tom, I'm standing in front of a house where a religious cult is planning to commit mass suicide when the meteor shower starts.	[]
Stan	2	0	Whoa, cool!	[]
Other	6	0	I wanna be a reporter someday.	[]
Other	45	0	Just moments ago, a couple emerged from the house.  According to the ATF, the couple refused to cooperate, then pulled out very big guns and started shooting everyone. The ATF had no choice but to shoot the insane couple, and now a standoff has ensued.	[]
Other	13	0	Oh, looks like that cult is about to be blown into tiny bits.	[]
Other	44	0	The ATF commander tells us that he has reason to believe there may be children inside and that they are the primary concern of all. There are choppers here along with several tanks.  The commander is very concerned about what the mood is inside.	[]
Stan	19	0	Wait a minute  Oh my God!  Dude! That's this house. They think our parents are the religious cult!	[]
Other	9	0	Do you think someday I can be a reporter?	[]
Other	30	1	We just received a photo from the recon team of the action inside the house  showing evidence that there are indeed innocent children trapped inside. Those sick cult fanatic bastards!	['bastards']
Stan	1	0	Dude!	[]
Butters	22	0	Hey, uhour parents aren't religious fantastics. Why, we gotta tell them that they're makin' an awful mistake, don't we?	[]
Other	11	0	Yes. Come on, Angels. Looks like we have a new mission.	[]
Other	11	1	Randy, you're making me feel unimportant. Talk. Talk, damn you.	['damn']
Randy	15	0	I'm just having a hard time with what we did in the hot tub.	[]
Other	8	0	So, so now we can't be friends?	[]
Randy	48	0	I didn't say that. I mean, I don't know, I... I just feel so strange. I know it's ridiculous, but I can't help feeling like people here know. You know? Like, even though nobody could know, 'cause we said we'd never tell anybody.	[]
Other	7	0	We said we'd never tell anybody?	[]
Randy	6	0	Well, of course we wouldn't.	[]
Other	7	0	Oh, uh I didn't realize that.	[]
Randy	8	0	Yuh... You didn't ...tell anybody, did you?	[]
Other	7	0	Well, uh uh a few people, yeah.	[]
Randy	8	1	What?! Why the hell would you do that?!	['hell']
Other	8	0	You didn't say not to tell anyone.	[]
Randy	27	1	Well, of course! I thought it would be implied! When you masturbate with another guy in a hot tub, you assume that nobody is gonna tell anybody!	['masturbate']
Other	15	0	Listen to you. You're yelling at me; you've never yelled at me before.	[]
Randy	1	0	AAAW!!	[]
Stan	29	0	Hey you guys! We've got a big problem!  The ATF is outside and they think you're all a religious cult. You've gotta go talk to them.	[]
Butters	21	0	Huh how come they're actin' that way, Stan, huh? Uh how come they're laughin' and fallin' down and such?	[]
Stan	4	0	Mom, go look outside.	[]
Other	5	0	Mommy's little boopie-kins	[]
Butters	70	0	Uh let me handle this, Stan.  Uh now l-listen up and listen good, everyone! Why, I'm awful disappointed in you drinkin' and carryin' on this way! Why you uhyou should be ashamed of yourselves! Uh if you don't get outside right now, and tell those army guys you're not religious fantastics, there's, why there's gonna be heck to pay. Uh, heck, I tell ya!	[]
Stan	11	0	Come on, we're gonna have to go tell 'em ourselves.	[]
Other	4	0	Lay down your weapons!	[]
Stan	6	0	We don't have any weapons.	[]
Other	22	0	Go back inside and tell everyone that they are surrounded! Tell them to come out peacefully, and we will not shoot them.	[]
Butters	1	0	Whoa!	[]
Stan	3	0	Get back inside!	[]
Other	13	0	I don't think they're gonna come out. Use the Ganz technique.	[]
Other	5	0	What's the Ganz technique?	[]
Other	45	1	This is what we did in Waco.  Play really bad music really loud until it drives them nuts and makes them want to come out.  Nobody can stand this much Cher. This is her new album. If this doesn't drive them out, nothing will.	['nuts']
Mr. Garrison	9	0	That's great music, Mr. Mackey. What is that?	[]
Mr. Mackey	9	0	Uh this is Cher. This is her new album.	[]
Mr. Garrison	5	1	Well, hell, turn it up.	['hell']
Other	14	1	Yeah, well, you know what I heard? I I heard that he's gay.	['gay']
Other	3	0	Oh, is he?	[]
Randy	1	0	Who?!	[]
Other	1	0	Huh?	[]
Randy	8	1	Who who did you hear is, is gay?!	['gay']
Other	4	0	Ricky Martin, the singer.	[]
Randy	1	0	Oh.	[]
Other	5	0	Hey, Randy, what's up?	[]
Randy	8	1	What the hell is that supposed to mean?!	['hell']
Other	1	0	Huh?	[]
Randy	12	0	Ssh-shouldn't you be hangin' out with your wife right now?	[]
Other	9	0	Wulluh uh I just felt like talkin' to you.	[]
Randy	6	0	There's nothing to talk about.	[]
Other	7	0	You're having regrets, aren't you?	[]
Randy	6	0	No, I-... I don't know.	[]
Other	4	0	Hey. Talk to me.	[]
Randy	1	0	No!	[]
Other	15	0	I thought we agreed what happened in the hot tub wouldn't change our relationship.	[]
Randy	9	0	Will you stop it?! I don't... I just...	[]
Other	15	0	Hey, Mr. Withdrawn, you might not need to talk about it, but I sure do.	[]
Randy	7	0	Aaww!  Sharon?  Sharon, cuh can we go?	[]
Other	9	0	Go?? The meteor shower hasn't even started yet.	[]
Randy	22	0	Uh I know, but I want to make love to you right now. I have to make love to you right now.	[]
Other	15	0	Randy, relax. We don't ever get to party. Now come on! Loosen up! Experiment!	[]
Randy	4	0	Ogh, I already did.	[]
Stan	6	0	Dad! Dad, they shot at us.	[]
Randy	3	0	Not now, Stanley.	[]
Stan	1	0	Mom!	[]
Other	1	0	Whoopee!	[]
Butters	37	0	Hey, what are we gonna do, huh?! Ughuh uh they shot at us! They really shot at us! They, they ain't gonna stop until we're all dead, I betcha. Huh us and all our families.	[]
Stan	6	0	Get a hold of yourself, man!	[]
Butters	17	0	How come you slapped my face, Stan, huh? Why uhwhy on earth would you do that, anyways?	[]
Stan	10	0	Come on. We have to find out what's happening.	[]
Other	17	0	I'm standing now with Danny Ganz, the commander of the ATF. Commander, what is the latest?	[]
Other	38	0	We have not had any cooperation with the cult inside the house. They are refusing to come out, and apparently they still plan to commit mass suicide once the meteor shower starts, which should be any moment now.	[]
Other	17	0	See how reporters get to wear those cool jackets? That's why I wanna be a reporter.	[]
Other	6	0	So what are your plans, commander?	[]
Other	25	0	Right now, our plan is to burn the house down. If we set it on fire, they'll have no choice but to come out.	[]
Butters	37	0	Oh dear God, they're gonna set us on fire. Uhoh, great Jesus, son of Mary, wife of Joseph, what are we gonna do, huh? Huhoh, sweet Joseph, husband of Mary but not father of sweet Jesus-	[]
Stan	1	0	Sh!	[]
Other	9	0	Setting them on fire seems a little dangerous, commander.	[]
Other	10	0	It is, but we can't let them kill themselves.	[]
Stan	13	0	We have to let them know that this isn't a cult party.	[]
Other	11	0	But we can't. They'll just shoot at us again.	[]
Butters	33	0	Uhuh, they're gonna burn us up and act like nothin' happened. Oh, sweet Jesus, Mary, mother of Jesus, wife of Joseph, father to Mary, well- Wait. Mary, wife uh... Oh, hold on.	[]
Stan	16	0	Come on, Angels. We've got a new mission. And this time, it's for real.	[]
Other	32	0	For hours now, the ATF has tried to communicate with the religious fanatics inside this house. The meteor shower is expected to begin at any moment, and so time is running out.	[]
Other	10	0	Hoh, look. Harold's doing it again, hm huh hnmkay?	[]
Other	39	0	This is Jill Munroe reporting live from inside the meteor shower party.  As you can see, this is a perfectly normal party. Nobody is killing themselves. We tried to tell ATF people, but they shot at us.  Anything else?	[]
Stan	7	0	Tell them not to burn us down.	[]
Other	11	0	Oh yeah. Don't burn us, please. Jill Munroe, GFN news.	[]
Other	5	0	Now what do we do?	[]
Stan	13	0	Now we find a way to get this tape to the real reporters.	[]
Other	6	0	Hey, I'm a real reporter.	[]
Stan	11	0	You're right. You are, Dougie. You did an awesome job.	[]
Other	36	0	Attention, cult people! Do not commit mass suicide! There are so many reasons not to kill yourselves! Flowers, for instance. And back rubs.  Alright, I'm through trying to reason with them. Send in the Negotiator!	[]
Other	15	0	Excuse me, but what proof do you have that those people inside are religious fanatics?	[]
Other	13	0	We know what we're doing. We did this all before in Waco.	[]
Other	23	0	Uh yes, but you totally screwed up Waco. You killed a bunch of innocent people and then tried to say they killed themselves.	[]
Other	7	0	Look. You see this? You see this?	[]
Other	1	0	Yes.	[]
