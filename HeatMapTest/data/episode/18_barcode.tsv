Chef	19	0	Okay, children, it's Friday, and you know what that means for PE class. We're gonna play dodgeball!	[]
Kyle	8	0	We don't wanna play dodgeball. It hurts.	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Chef	17	0	So let's have half the children on this side  and half the children on that side.	[]
Other	16	0	Uhh... Excuse me a moment, gentlemen. I don't believe I know how to play dodgeball.	[]
Cartman	8	0	What? Don't you have dodgeball in France?	[]
Other	9	0	Well, no. And actually, I'm not from France--	[]
Stan	29	0	Look, Pip, the rules are simple. A kid from that team is gonna try to bean a kid on our team in the head with a big red ball.	[]
Other	2	0	Oh, dear.	[]
Stan	27	0	If the ball hits you, you're out, but if you catch the ball, he's out, and the last team to still have anybody standing wins.	[]
Other	5	0	Oh, what jolly good fun!	[]
Kyle	17	0	No it isn't, it hurts! I can't believe they let us play this in school.	[]
Chef	2	0	Play ball!	[]
Clyde	4	0	Ow! Ahow-ow-ooooowww!	[]
Stan	5	1	Dammit, we lost one already!	['dammit']
Chef	6	0	Aheeheh, you're out, Clyde! Heheheh.	[]
Stan	7	0	Jordan, Swanson, pull forward! We need backup!	[]
Other	1	0	Aagghhh!	[]
Stan	7	0	We're losing men fast out here!	[]
Chef	9	0	Concentrate on your ge-hame! Be the buhaw-hall!	[]
Kyle	6	0	I caught it! I caught it!	[]
Chef	9	0	Great catch, Kyle! Now your team's on offense!	[]
Kyle	4	0	Here, Pip, you throw.	[]
Other	6	0	Ugh... Oh, no, I couldn't.	[]
Kyle	20	0	Come on, limey, don't be a wuss! Are you just gonna be a little French pig your whole life?	[]
Other	4	0	I'm not French--	[]
Kyle	23	1	Throw the ball, you stupid frog!  God-damn, maybe if you didn't eat all those croissants,  you'd be able to-- Ow!	['damn']
Chef	18	0	Okay, that was pretty good, Pip, but you're supposed to hit the kids on the other team.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Ow, my nose! You broke my nose!	[]
Cartman	11	1	Damn, Pip. I didn't know you had it in you.	['damn']
Other	5	0	Ogh! I'm dreadfully sorry!	[]
Chef	19	0	That nose is bleeding pretty bad, Kyle. I think you might have to go to the nurse's office.	[]
Kyle	6	0	No. No, it'll be okay!	[]
Chef	14	0	Sorry, son. You'll have to let the nurse look at it. Come on.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Oh-- Noooo!	[]
Cartman	9	0	Dude! He's going to the nurse's office.	[]
Clyde	8	0	I heard the school nurse is hideously deformed.	[]
Bebe	10	0	I heard she has tentacles and eats children for lunch.	[]
Cartman	14	0	Stan? Has anybody actually seen the nurse, and come back to tell about it?	[]
Stan	5	0	No, Cartman. Nobody ever has.	[]
Other	4	0	Are you Kyle Broflovski?	[]
Kyle	2	0	Ye-yes.	[]
Other	10	0	I'm the school nurse. Did you hurt your nose?	[]
Kyle	2	0	Ye-yes.	[]
Other	15	0	Young man, Why do you have your eyes closed? I'm not gonna hurt you.	[]
Kyle	2	0	I know.	[]
Other	3	0	So open them.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Oh!  Phew.	[]
Other	7	0	Now, what seems to be the problem?	[]
Kyle	8	0	Aw, I just hit my nose playing dodgeball.	[]
Other	9	0	Oh. Well, I'll get you an ice pack.	[]
Kyle	1	0	AAGGGGGHHHH!!	[]
Other	1	0	What?	[]
Kyle	3	0	OOOOOHHHHH MY GOD!!	[]
Other	18	0	Oh, I see you've noticed my disorder. I have a stillborn fetus growth attached to my head.	[]
Kyle	1	0	AAAARRRRGGGGGGHHHHH!!!	[]
Kyle	11	0	...And when she moved up and down, the little fetus jiggled.	[]
Other	1	0	Eewwww!	[]
Cartman	9	0	Did it talk? The little fetus, did it talk?	[]
Kyle	5	0	No. No-it looked dead.	[]
Other	1	0	Eewwww!	[]
Stan	5	0	Wa-was it wearing clothes?	[]
Kyle	8	0	Dude, where is she gonna get fetus clothes?	[]
Stan	3	0	Oh, yeah. Eeww.	[]
Other	1	0	Eewwww!	[]
Kyle	6	0	And then she walked over to--	[]
Other	30	0	Kyle! That is enough! I've been reading up on your poor nurse's condition, and it is nothing to be made fun of. It's called conjoined twin myslexia.	[]
Cartman	18	1	Who the hell cares what it's called, as long as she doesn't have to touch me.	['hell']
Other	44	0	Now, that's just the kind of unawareness that we need to fight against. Sit down, boys.  You see boys, sometimes, when babies are born, they're born as twins. But sometimes the twins get hooked together, and they're born as Siamese twins.	[]
Other	1	0	Gross!	[]
Other	51	0	But sometimes, after the Siamese twins are joined together, one of the twins dies before birth. The living baby is born with the dead baby still attached.  Sometimes, this dead twin is inside the living person, so even you could have a dead twin inside you and not even know it!	[]
Stan	1	0	AGGGGGGHHHHHH!	[]
Cartman	5	0	AGGHHH! Let me live! AGGGHHH!	[]
Other	20	0	So now that you're educated about her disease, you won't need to make fun of her. Right, bubbe?	[]
Kyle	2	0	Uhhhh... Yeah.	[]
Other	7	0	Can you imagine that poor, poor woman?	[]
Other	2	0	Mm-hmm.	[]
Other	8	0	Feeling like an outcast, being ridiculed every day...	[]
Other	2	0	Mm-hmm.	[]
Other	1	0	Hello?	[]
Other	8	0	Hello, Sheila? It's Sharon, Stan's mother.	[]
Other	4	0	Oh, yes. Hello, Sharon.	[]
Other	23	0	Sheila, I was just wondering if you might know why my son is trying to split his head open with an ice pick?	[]
Stan	7	0	No! I have to get it out!	[]
Other	13	0	Well, Sharon, I was just trying to educate them about conjoined twin myslexia.	[]
Other	5	0	So this is your fault.	[]
Stan	1	0	ARRRGGGGGGGHHHHHH!	[]
Randy	6	1	Damn it, stop.  Oh!  Damm it!	['damn']
Other	33	1	Would you do me a favor? Next time you want to scare the hell out of my child, just go outside and sit in the road until a truck runs you over instead?	['hell']
Other	13	0	That does it! I must educate the entire town about this awful disease!	[]
Other	2	0	Mm-hmm.	[]
Stan	12	0	Dude, I don't get it. Why are we playing dodgeball again?	[]
Cartman	8	0	Yeah. I thought we only played on Fridays.	[]
Chef	15	0	Children! Great news! We've been asked to play in the State Finals for dodgeball!	[]
Other	1	0	Awww...	[]
Stan	5	0	Aw, do we have to?	[]
Kyle	12	0	Can't we just play with that big parachute again or something?	[]
Chef	21	0	You-you don't understand, children. If we can win State, we can play in the Nationals in Washington, D.C.!	[]
Cartman	6	0	Heyh! They have a zoo there!	[]
Chef	14	0	That's right! Now, come on! We have a lot of practicing to do!	[]
Stan	15	0	Aren't we supposed to have won something in order to go to State Finals?	[]
Kyle	10	0	Hey, Pip. Do you wanna be on my team again?	[]
Other	4	0	I'd love to!	[]
Cartman	15	0	Now, let's try not to send anyone to that monster nurse this time, Frenchy.	[]
Other	23	0	Hey! I get quite disturbed when you call me that! You shouldn't make fun of foreigners.  And besides, I hate French people.	[]
Other	21	0	Well, Mrs. Broflovski, it certainly is a thrill seeing your cheery face again. What seems to be pissing you off today?	[]
Other	11	0	Nothing is pissing me off! I just wanta start a movement.	[]
Other	5	0	O-of course you do.	[]
Other	11	0	I want to talk to you all about your school nurse.	[]
Mr. Mackey	9	0	Uh, Nurse Gollum is absolutely qualified to be a--	[]
Other	36	0	No, no no. I'm not upset about her. I want to make the public aware of her. Her disease should be brought to light so that it can be understood rather than made fun of.	[]
Other	7	0	Oh, and uh, what disease is that?	[]
Mr. Mackey	9	0	Uh, Principal Victoria, Nurse Gollum has conjoined twin myslexia.	[]
Other	3	0	What's that?	[]
Other	9	0	She has a dead fetus attached to her head.	[]
Other	2	0	She does?	[]
Mr. Mackey	5	0	Y-you never noticed that?	[]
Other	5	0	No-o, I never did.	[]
Other	40	0	Well, that's exactly what I'm talking about. This poor woman is forced to live in the shadows because she feels like an outcast. It is up to us to make her feel comfortable and welcome in our town!	[]
Other	10	0	Did you say a fetus, sticking out from her head?	[]
Other	27	0	I want to invite your nurse to a dinner party at my house this evening. I'd appreciate it if both you and Mr. Mackey would attend.	[]
Mr. Mackey	7	0	Do we have to eat kosher stuff?	[]
Other	20	0	Well, I'll talk to Nurse Gollum, but I'm sure she'll be delighted. Let's say around 8?	[]
Other	1	0	Wonderful!	[]
Other	11	0	Now, you did say she has a fetus on her head?	[]
Chef	10	0	Okay children.  Now, who's gonna win the State Finals?	[]
Clyde	1	0	Denver?	[]
Chef	30	0	Here we go Ca-ows, here we go: Unh, unh! Here we go Ca-ows, here we go: Unh, unh! I think we need to get off on this exit.	[]
Other	3	0	SIT DOWN, KID!!	[]
Chef	12	0	But it's quicker to get to the Denver school that way!	[]
Other	6	0	DO YOU WANT AN OFFICE REFERRAL?!	[]
Chef	25	0	How many times do I have to explain this to you?! I'm not a student! You can't give me an office referral, and-!	[]
Other	4	0	I SAID SIT DOOWWN!!!	[]
Chef	3	0	Yes, ma'am.	[]
Stan	6	0	Whoa, dude, this is a school?	[]
Other	12	0	Hello, there. I'm Bob Thomas, the coach for the Denver Cougars.	[]
Chef	9	0	I'm Chef, coach of the South Park Cows.	[]
Other	52	0	Well, I certainly want to thank you for bringing your team down. Apparently, nobody else would play us, because they knew we'd just beat 'em silly. So I told the school board to find me some hick school from the mountains, and here you are.  You're from South Park, yeah?	[]
Chef	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Other	34	0	My G-hod, amazing where people can live nowadays. Well, we might as well get this over with; we've gotta start thinking about D.C. Promise we won't make it too painful.	[]
Other	2	0	Play ball!	[]
Other	10	0	So, uhh, where did you get your degree, Nurse Gollum?	[]
Other	2	0	Colorado State.	[]
Other	1	0	Ahhh.	[]
Other	1	0	Oh.	[]
Other	12	0	Sheila, could you pass me the dead fetus?  I mean, gravy.  Ow!	[]
Other	1	0	Ow!	[]
Chef	7	1	Dammit, come on!  Somebody catch the ball!	['dammit']
Other	12	1	All right, boys, just five more of the little bastards to go!	['bastards']
Cartman	6	0	I caught it, I caught it!	[]
Other	14	1	Oh, that's not fair! He's so fat, it stuck in his belly!	['fat']
Other	4	0	South Park on offense!	[]
Chef	7	0	Great job, children! Just stay focused now.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Go for it, Pip.	[]
Other	2	0	Oh, bother.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Come on, you Frenchy little frog!	[]
Other	1	0	Gagghh!	[]
Chef	7	3	Whoa-ho-ho-ho! Great shot, Pip!	['ho', 'ho', 'ho']
Other	17	0	Ehsooo, I hear that the South Park Cows are playing for the State Finals in dodgeball tonight.	[]
Mr. Mackey	18	0	Yeah, but you know, it-it doesn't matter though. The-the Denver team always wins, m'kay?	[]
Other	18	0	Oh, I don't know. I think our boys might just have the dead fetus to win-- Heart!	[]
Other	6	1	Gerald!  Keep your damn mouth shut!	['damn']
Other	7	0	I-it's okay, Ms. Broflovski. Really.	[]
Other	10	0	Please forgive us. I-I'm terribly sorry, Nurse Gollum.	[]
Other	7	0	No, I'm quite secure with it.	[]
Other	15	0	I have felt so bad ever since I heard the boys making fun of you--	[]
Other	21	0	They're just young boys. Joking is a way for them to come to terms with what they don't understand.	[]
Mr. Mackey	6	0	Could I get some more pork?	[]
Other	13	0	So did you ever think of just, you know, having it cut off?	[]
Other	15	0	Yes, Principal Victoria, the thought had occurred to me. Unfortunately, it would mean my death.	[]
Other	13	0	Ooohh, so I suppose that's out. Uh-how about a hat, then?	[]
Other	7	0	No, really, I don't need a--	[]
Other	18	0	Yes, we could get you a few hats and wear a different one every day. No big whoop.	[]
Other	21	0	I really appreciate what you're trying to do here, but it's not necessary. I'm a pretty happy person.	[]
Other	21	0	I've got it! We could set aside a whole week to make the public aware of folks just like you.	[]
Other	15	0	Ooohh, yeess, a Conjoined Twin Myslexia Awareness Week. You know, that has a nice ring.	[]
Other	6	0	But I really don't think--	[]
Mr. Mackey	18	0	Th-the school could put out pamphlets, m'kay? And we could have seminars to educate, m'kay?	[]
Other	16	0	Ooooh, this is so exciting! I'm gonna get the mayor on the phone right now!	[]
Chef	15	0	You got just one more, Pip. You get this kid, and we are State Champions.	[]
Cartman	16	1	Yeah, and if you don't, you're a big dumbass European hippie piece of crap.	['crap']
Kyle	3	0	Get him, Frenchy!	[]
Other	1	0	Gaagghh!	[]
Other	3	0	South Park wins!	[]
Chef	14	0	We did it, children, we did it! We're going to Washington, D.C.!	[]
Other	13	0	Uh-hu-hu-hu-howieee!  Ihit hurhurts! Howieee!  Mommy, it huurts! Ihit hurhurts!	[]
Chef	30	3	Oh, sorry about whoopin' your ass there, Coach! Ooo, baby, come on Just whooped Denver's ass Gonna need some cream for your ass It's all swollen and red	['ass', 'ass', 'ass']
Other	125	0	Ladies and gentlemen, this is indeed a great week for South Park. Ms. Hermans has opened the east wing of the library, and our own South Park Cows Elementary School Dodgeball Team is going to the national finals;  where they will undoubtedly be beaten senseless by the Washington team.  But most importantly, this week has brought to my attention a very serious and dreaded disease: conjoined twin myslexia. And so it is in honor of this that I declare this exciting week as Conjoined Twin Myslexia Week!  And now, let's kick off our weeklong festivities with the first annual Grand Conjoined Parade!  Let's hear it for these brave souls!  What a glorious parade that was! Let's hear it for the parade coordinators!	[]
Other	21	0	You know, Mayor, I really should be accompanying those kids to Washington in case they get hurt. That is my job.	[]
Other	10	0	Nonsense. This is your week. You aren't going anywhere.	[]
Chef	7	0	How much further is Washington, D.C.?	[]
Other	3	0	SIT DOWN, KID!!	[]
Chef	9	0	I need to know how far it is, lady!	[]
Other	4	0	I SAID SIT DOWN!!!	[]
Chef	8	1	Yeah, whatever, you old, dried-up, fat hog.	['fat']
Other	4	0	WHAT DID YOU SAY?!	[]
Chef	9	0	I said, I've always wanted to visit Prague.	[]
Other	3	0	Oh, me too.	[]
Stan	5	0	Okay, what have you got?	[]
Kyle	5	1	Some hadka fish, some gafagga...	['gafagga']
Cartman	10	0	I got a jelly roll! I got a jelly roll!	[]
Stan	7	0	Sweet! A jelly roll is perfect!  Places!	[]
Other	1	0	ARRRRRRGGGGHHHH!!!	[]
Other	1	0	Whoa!	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Sheesh!)	[]
Chef	8	1	Damn, man. This is the big time, alright.	['damn']
Stan	4	0	Chef, we're hungry.	[]
Chef	25	0	You can eat after the game. You children win this one, and you're National Champions! Then you can go on and play the Chinese.	[]
Cartman	12	0	My mom says there's a lot of black people in China.	[]
Chef	1	0	What?	[]
Other	3	0	Are you Chef?	[]
Chef	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Other	12	0	The Washington team has forfeited the game. Congratulations, you're national champions.	[]
Chef	7	0	What? We did it! Children, we won!	[]
Kyle	4	0	Wow, that was easy.	[]
Other	21	0	Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear a round of applause for the new national champions of dodgeball, the South Park Cows!	[]
Kyle	6	0	Hey, why did you guys forfeit?	[]
Other	6	0	You mean you don't know?	[]
Kyle	2	0	Know what?	[]
Other	30	0	Last year's national champions were the Austin Pirates. They played China for the world championship. Only four of them came back alive. Chinese dodgeball players aren't like us.	[]
Other	7	0	Bush langli. Woon taun. Waya ching gia!	[]
Other	35	0	They do nothing but dodgeball, day in, and day out. They use steroids and advanced training equipment to make them, not kids, but animals.  Well, good luck. We've got our futures to think about.	[]
Chef	6	0	Okay, children, back in the bus.	[]
Other	29	0	And so, at this honorary dinner we take a look back at our beloved Nurse Gollum and the brave life she has lived. Roll the tape, please, Mr. Garrison.	[]
Other	2	0	Oh, no..!	[]
Other	45	0	You've got the strength, you've got the courage Even with a dead fetus on your head You carry on You fight for tomorrow Dead fetus or no, you never let go You're my conjoined-twin-dead-thing-hanging-off-your-head woman	[]
Other	92	0	She's painting her house orange, and annoyed that Garrison is filming it. She looks out the window, and is annoyed that he is still there, filming. She's in her office. She's at the supermarket, annoyed, she's trying to cover the camera lens so Garrison would stop filming. At the post office, she's trying to shoo him away, she's very angry that he's filming her. She's on the toilet, and she clamps her legs shut, with hands before them for added security. She's outraged.	[]
Other	5	0	Oh, that was so touching.	[]
Other	32	0	And now, friends, it's time to present the Lifetime Conjoined Twin Achievement Award. This award goes to outstanding conjoined twins who have made a mark on society. And the winner is...	[]
Other	2	0	Nurse Gollum.	[]
Other	2	0	Nurse Gollum!!	[]
Other	2	0	Oh, boy.	[]
Other	38	0	Excuse me, Mayor, but I just received some news that you might all be interested in.  Our South Park Cows have just beaten the Washington dodgeball team, and are on their way to the world championship in China.	[]
Chef	19	0	Okay, children, now, we're almost to China. I want you all to try and focus on your game.	[]
Stan	9	0	But Chef, we don't wanna play the Chinese!	[]
Chef	10	0	Nonsense! If we win this one, we're world champions.	[]
Kyle	5	0	But we could get killed!	[]
Chef	24	0	And just what price would you pay for eternal glory?  Just imagine: a big yellow Dodgeball Champions banner hanging in the cafeteria! Imagine it!	[]
Stan	5	0	Dude, Chef has lost it.	[]
Chef	28	0	You'll be in the news all over the world. South Park will finally have a sport that it's good at. Ohh, children, it'll be glorious!	[]
Cartman	9	0	So, Captain Ahab has to get his whale, huh?	[]
Kyle	5	0	Dude, what does that mean?	[]
Cartman	2	0	I dunno.	[]
Stan	7	0	Hey, isn't that kid Kevin Chinese?	[]
Kyle	5	0	Yeah, you're from China.	[]
Other	9	0	No, I'm from America. My parents are Chinese.	[]
Stan	7	0	Tell us how the Chinese play dodgeball!	[]
Other	5	0	I have no idea, dude.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Come on, rice picker!	[]
Chef	19	0	Hey, hey hey!  Children, that's not cool! You don't make fun of somebody because of their ethnicity.	[]
Stan	3	0	You don't?	[]
Kyle	8	0	But Chef, you just ripped on Chinese people.	[]
Chef	52	0	No, no, no, no, no, that's different. I made fun of them because they are from China. You see, it's not okay to make fun of an American because they're black, brown, or whatever, but it is okay to make fun of foreigners because they are from another country.	[]
Other	1	0	Ohhh.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Oooh, I get it.	[]
Other	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Other	1	0	AAAGGGGHHHH!	[]

Other	28	0	Okay, Tom, rooks rike A-mericans are getting ready to play. I don't suppose they'll have any problems seeing the ball with their big American eyes!	[]
Other	21	0	Yeah. Good thing they have those big eyes so that they don't have to rery on that amazing American interrect.	[]
Other	5	0	Oh, you say such things.	[]
Other	4	0	That's a zinger!	[]

Other	54	0	Ladies and gentlemen, on this fourth day of Conjoined Twin Myslexia Week, all our prayers are with our little South Park Cows now playing their hearts out in China.  Now, join me in saluting our Cows and help make Nurse Gollum not feel like an outcast with our first official Conjoined Twin Myslexia hats!	[]
Other	21	0	And there is-a only a one South Park prayer left.  Still all Chinese prayer. This should be over veerry shortly.	[]

Other	10	0	Yes yes!  Y'all come a-back now, you hear?	[]
Chef	86	0	Oh, what have I done?  You know, Eric, I just realized something. I have been obsessed, and obsession isn't good.  If we had won the world championship, what then?  It would only be a bigger letdown the next year if we didn't win! Our lives would have to revolve around dodgeball. Our lives were fine before.  Oh, I'm sorry, children. I let it all go to my head. Can you ever forgive me?  Come on, forget this stupid game. Let's go home.	[]
Other	4	0	Come on! Throw ball!	[]
Other	11	0	Hey, if you wanna make him throw the ball, say this.	[]

Other	19	0	Did you all see? I can't believe I threw such a ball with my own arm. It was--	[]
Other	3	0	Shut up, Pip!	[]
Other	41	0	As this year's Conjoined Twin Myslexia Awareness Week draws to a close, I would like to personally thank all of you for your enthusiastic cooperation.  Now, let's hear it one more time for our world champion South Park Cows!	[]
Kyle	9	1	What the hell is everyone wearing on their heads?	['hell']
Other	16	0	And now, let's hear from the woman of the week! The incredible, courageous Nurse Gollum!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Agghh!	[]
Stan	6	0	Dude, it's the freak nurse!	[]
Cartman	2	1	Holy crap!	['crap']
Other	13	1	Dammit, Kyle! We've been working all week against that kind of behavior!	['dammit']
Kyle	7	0	Well sorry, dude, we weren't here.	[]
Other	20	0	Thank you, Mayor. I uhhh, wa-I... I don't know what to say; this has been quite a week.	[]

Other	95	1	Don't you realize that the last thing I ever wanted was to be singled out?  I just wanted to do my job and live my life like any normal person, but instead you've made everybody focus on my handicap all week long.  Look, I don't want to be treated different. I don't want to be treated special orh-or treated gingerly. I just want to be ridiculed, shouted at, and made fun of like all the rest of you do to each other.  And take those stupid things off your heads!	['gingerly']
