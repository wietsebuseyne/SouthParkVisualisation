Other	44	0	As we steer our boat down , looking for these dangerous predators... Boy, there's a king croc right here.  He must be four meters; 12, 13 feet long at least.  This croc has enough power in its jaws to rip my head right off.	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Oh, no!)	[]
Other	24	1	I've got to be careful. So, what I'm gonna do is sneak up on it and jam my thumb in its butthole.	['butthole']
Stan	3	1	Holy crap. dude!	['crap']
Other	33	1	If I get bit out here, I'm 200 kilometers from the nearest hospital: I'd better be real careful jamming my thumb in its butthole.  Oh, boy, it's pissed off now.	['butthole']
Kyle	3	0	Go, dude, go!	[]
Other	29	1	I'm gonna jam my thumb it its butthole now! This should really piss it off!  Oh, yeah, that pissed it off, all right!  I've gotta be careful!	['butthole']
Stan	3	0	This guy rules!	[]
Kenny	4	0	(He actually killed it!)	[]
Cartman	4	0	I told you guys.	[]
Other	48	0	Well! That was quite an angry croc! But I managed to escape with only a few bruises and a shattered left testicle. Next week we'll look for more of these beautiful creatures, so we can learn more about them by pissing them off immensely. Thanks for watching.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Dude! Let's go look for crocodiles!	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Cartman	24	0	There's bound to be some crocs up here. I'll use my croc call and try to bring 'em out. Brigeghus, brigeghus! Brig-!	[]
Kyle	10	1	That's not how a croc sounds, you fatass penis!	['penis']
Cartman	18	0	Ogh! Now I'm gonna kick my friend Kyle in the beanbag and see what happens, by crikey!	[]
Kyle	5	0	Get away from me, Cartman!	[]
Cartman	3	0	Come 'ere, crocky.	[]
Kyle	1	0	AAAAAAAAAA!	[]
Stan	1	0	Dude!	[]
Kyle	1	0	HELP!	[]
Stan	6	0	Good job, Cartman! You killed Kyle!	[]
Kenny	2	1	(You bastard!)	['bastard']
Cartman	8	1	Well, he shouldn't have called me fat.	['fat']
Stan	11	1	Why the hell not?! That's like calling the sky blue!	['hell']
Cartman	12	0	Well, screw him, he's dead! Let's go look for crocodiles!	[]
Kyle	2	0	You guuuys!	[]
Stan	8	0	Hey, he's still alive.  Kyle, you okay?	[]
Kyle	7	0	I think so. Is Cartman up there?	[]
Cartman	5	0	I'm right here, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	14	6	Cartman, you fucking hunk of fat, rat-fucking hunk of pig-fucking ass fat.	['fucking', 'fat', 'fucking', 'fucking', 'ass', 'fat']
Cartman	10	1	Oh yeah?! Oh yeah?! Say that to my face, pussy!	['pussy']
Stan	6	0	Can you climb back up, dude?	[]
Kyle	5	0	I don't think so.	[]
Stan	11	1	Damn it, I guess I'll have to go get him.	['damn']
Cartman	11	0	Nah. Come on, guys. Let's go look for crocodi-iles.	[]
Stan	9	0	Whoa, dude. This is making me sick. Blaach!  Bluchluchluchluch.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Sick, dude!	[]
Stan	9	2	Sorry.  What the hell are you doing, fat boy?!	['hell', 'fat']
Cartman	3	0	Screw you, hippie!	[]
Kyle	9	0	Come on, dude. I wanna get out of here.	[]
Stan	12	0	All right. Just grab the rope. Wait a minute. What's this?	[]
Other	1	0	AAAAAAAAAAAAA!	[]
Kyle	5	0	Dude, it's a dude!	[]
Stan	6	0	He's like, some frozen guy.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Come on, you guys, it's getting cold up here!	[]
Stan	27	0	Shut up, Cartman!  Dude, I saw this in a movie once. The old cavemen get frozen, and then people discover them and make them their caveman friends.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Wow. Cool.	[]
Stan	17	0	You guys, there's a frozen ape man from the past down here! Send some more rope!	[]
Cartman	9	0	Really?  Hey, there's a frozen guy down there.	[]
Stan	8	0	Help me chip some of the ice away.	[]
Cartman	63	0	Hey you guys. This is just like that one movie, um, John Travolta and that, French chick were doing it, all summer long and went back to school and sang songs about Greased Lightning.  You know, that movie where Sandra Dee thinks she's all prissy, and then they try and try to get an abortion, but she doesn't have all the-	[]
Other	12	1	Cartman, will you shut the hell up and get some more rope?!	['hell']
Cartman	5	0	Aww, screw you guys anyway!	[]
Stan	12	0	Hey, remember when that kid found a wallet and got a reward?	[]
Kyle	12	0	Yeah, sweet! Maybe we can get a reward for the frozen guy!	[]
Other	1	0	Hooray!	[]
Cartman	2	0	For what?	[]
Stan	5	0	Where shall we bring it?	[]
Kyle	22	0	I don't know. We just have to get it to town and let them figure out what to do with it.	[]
Stan	9	0	I think I'm going to name it Gorak.	[]
Kyle	8	0	No, dude! We have to name it Steve.	[]
Stan	10	1	Steve? What the hell kind of caveman name is Steve?	['hell']
Kyle	8	0	It's my name, and I found him.	[]
Stan	8	0	You didn't find him, I found him.	[]
Kyle	15	0	What are you talking about, dude?! I fell down that abyss and there it was!	[]
Stan	14	0	You wouldn't even have noticed it if I hadn't pointed it out.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Kenny, who found the ice man?	[]
Kenny	9	0	(Well, I think you guys should name it Steve)	[]
Cartman	8	0	I think we're almost there, you guys.	[]
Other	34	0	Aalll right, people. The next order of business is a very serious matter. We need to vote on whether South Park should reinstate the death penalty or not. All those in favor, say yippee.	[]
Other	1	0	Yippee.	[]
Other	9	0	Wait, what was that? I missed the question. Yippee!	[]
Other	5	0	All those opposed, say nay.	[]
Other	1	0	Nay.	[]
Other	2	0	Screw you!	[]
Other	3	0	Ey! Screw you!	[]
Stan	3	0	Huh, excuse me?	[]
Other	14	0	Not now, kids. The town is having a very important debate on capital punishment.	[]
Kyle	10	0	But we found a frozen ice man from the past!	[]
Stan	9	0	I found this frozen guy in the woods today.	[]
Kyle	10	0	No. I found this frozen guy in the woods today.	[]
Other	7	1	What the hell is going on here?	['hell']
Kyle	5	0	We came for our reward.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Yeah, like the kid with the wallet.	[]
Other	3	0	Reward? What reward?	[]
Other	55	0	Mayor, I think the boys may have stumbled onto something here. You see, Mayor, frozen links are often found: dinosaur eggs, woolly mammoths. This specimen could be a missing link  in our evolution. If I can unfreeze the body, and perform an autopsy, I could learn much about this creature's people and its time.	[]
Other	10	0	Sure sure sure, be my guest, knock your socks off.	[]
Other	29	0	Thank you, Mayor. Oh, and boys, I, I can't give you a reward for finding this creature, but if you'd like, I'll let you name him.	[]
Stan	1	0	Really.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Sweet. How about Steve?	[]
Other	3	0	Steve it is.	[]
Stan	7	0	Wait a minute! His name is Gorak!	[]
Other	27	0	Come on, Steve. We've got work to do.  Unfreezing this body will be quite delicate work. We'll have to use the most advanced methods available.	[]
Other	71	0	This is very exciting. He could be a Neanderthal. Or an Australopithecus from the Paleolithic era.  Do you see that, Kevin? These clothes are from Eddie Bauer. I haven't seen anybody wear clothes from Eddie Bauer since... 1996!  This is incredible! Think of all we can learn from this body! All that it can teach us! Let's just hope the press doesn't get wind of this right away.	[]
Other	9	0	Stand back, people. There's nothing to see here.	[]
Other	6	0	What about the prehistoric ice man?	[]
Other	5	0	Oh, yeah. There is that.	[]
Other	11	0	Dr. Mephesto, could you please tell us what's going on?	[]
Other	52	0	Ladies and gentlemen, we still have a lot of work to do.  But it is my opinion that this man has been frozen in time for over 32 months!  Yes, it's true, although at this early stage we know very little about this man or the time from which he comes.	[]
Other	48	0	Fascinating news tonight from South Park. An ancient discovery of a prehistoric man actually frozen in ice. A team of scientists continues to try and unfreeze the body so that it can be autopsied, and studied. The caveman was discovered by Kyle Broflovski, who had this to say:	[]
Kyle	23	0	Well, I fell down this ice cavern,  and I saw this block of ice, so I told my friend to throw a rope-	[]
Other	31	0	The prehistoric ice man is thought to be from the late neo-post-Jurassic era, where he was probably part of a hunting and gathering tribe that lived on Waterston Street.	[]
Other	10	0	That's it, Kevin. Now we can begin the autopsy.	[]
Other	4	0	Ugh? What's this?	[]
Other	5	1	Holy crap! He's alive??	['crap']
Other	8	0	That's impossible!  Do an EKG on him!	[]
Other	12	0	My God, he really is alive. The ice must have preserved him!	[]
Other	4	0	Well, quick, do something!	[]
Other	32	0	Nono, we've got to think this through.  Mayor, this man has not been conscious for almost three years. He won't understand what he sees! He'll be frightened and confused!	[]
Other	8	0	Well, you just can't let him die.	[]
Other	16	0	Perhaps death is better than the shock he will take trying to adapt to our time.	[]
Other	12	0	Oh my God. It looks as if he's about to speak!	[]
Other	1	0	What?	[]
Other	4	0	What's he saying?	[]
Other	3	0	Is that English?	[]
Other	6	0	What? You're, you're hungry?	[]
Other	5	0	You're, you're hungry?	[]
Other	11	0	Me friend. Friieend. Me friend. Ma-phes-to. Mah-phehs-to.	[]
Other	39	0	Hawgh! If we could understand what he's saying, then maybe we could get some answers.  If only there was someone who could communicate with him on a level as primitive as his own, a mind like... a child.	[]
Stan	7	0	Dude, I wanted to call him Gorak.	[]
Kyle	5	1	Gorak's a gay name.	['gay']
Stan	4	0	No, it isn't!	[]
Kyle	7	1	Why are you being such a dick?	['dick']
Stan	11	2	I'm not being a dick, you're being a dick!	['dick', 'dick']
Kyle	2	0	Nuh-uh!	[]
Other	20	0	Hello, children. Dr. Mephesto needs one of you to help him out in his lab with the prehistoric ice man.	[]
Kyle	3	0	I'll go.	[]
Stan	7	0	No, I'll go! I found him!	[]
Cartman	10	1	Damn, I've never seen you guys fight like this!	['damn']
Other	38	0	All right, there's only one fair way to do this. Everyone stick out their potatoes.  My mother and your mother were out hanging clothes. My mother punched your mother in the nose. What color blood came out?	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Blue.)	[]
Other	34	0	B L O O uh oh-O spells blue and that means that you will go to the lab and help out Mephesto and then we can all go home and watch Murphy Brown.	[]
Other	2	0	Steve. You-	[]
Other	8	0	Steeve. Steeeve. Steeeve.  Oh good, you're here.	[]
Stan	6	0	Oh my God, they revived Gorak.	[]
Kyle	2	1	You bastards!	['bastards']
Other	18	0	Yes, and I need you to communicate with him. See if you can understand what he's saying.	[]
Stan	2	0	Uh. Hi.	[]
Other	4	0	What'd he say?	[]
Stan	3	0	He said, hi.	[]
Other	2	0	Very interesting.	[]
Other	1	0	What??	[]
Stan	7	0	He wants to know where he is.	[]
Other	7	0	Tell him, tell him he's... home.	[]
Stan	3	0	You're... home.	[]
Other	4	0	In the year 1999.	[]
Other	9	0	He's been frozen for the last 32 months.	[]
Stan	7	0	Dude, you've been frozen 32 months.	[]
Other	4	0	And we found you-	[]
Other	5	0	All right, all right, all-	[]
Other	6	0	All right, all right, calm down.	[]
Other	7	0	I think that's enough for today.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Good job, dude! You freaked him out!	[]
Stan	15	0	Oh, shut up, assmaster. You're just jealous 'cause they had me talk to him.	[]
Kyle	15	0	Guess what? You're not my best friend anymore! Cartman's my new best friend!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Sweet.	[]
Stan	17	0	Oh yeah? Well You're not my best friend anymore, either! Cartman is now my best friend!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Killer.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Fine!	[]
Stan	1	0	Fine!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Fine.	[]
Other	4	0	Are you Alphonse Mephesto?	[]
Other	2	0	The same.	[]
Other	15	0	We understand that you are currently in possession of the prehistoric ice man from 1996.	[]
Other	3	0	That's right.	[]
Other	14	0	We would like to...  we would like to offer our services in your experiments.	[]
Other	6	0	Oh? Where are you gents from?	[]
Other	7	0	We are from the University, of... America.	[]
Other	38	0	Well, there's not a lot to see, but... Come in.  He's still not responding much to us; the shock is still settling in,  but we've made great progress now that he's in the habitat.	[]
Other	1	0	Habitat?	[]
Other	23	0	Yes. Kevin and I designed a habitat for Steve to live in that is completely like his own world. Everything is 1996-oriented.	[]
Other	7	0	Amazing. He looks so much like us.	[]
Other	26	0	Yes, well, Kevin has done a lot of work in figuring out just how related to us Steve really is. He came up with this drawing:	[]
Other	19	0	Dr. Mephesto, we realize that scientific study is expensive. We want to help you make this project more... lucrative.	[]
Other	5	0	How would we do that?	[]
Other	3	0	It's easy.	[]
Other	30	0	As you can see, the ice man is listening to Ace of Base, which was a very popular group during his era, and primitive drumming soothed his people's tempers.	[]
Stan	8	0	He doesn't look very happy in there.	[]
Kyle	5	0	No, he sure doesn't.	[]
Stan	12	1	I wasn't talking to you, buttpipe! I was talking to Cartman!	['buttpipe']
Kyle	7	0	Well, I was talking to Cartman, too!	[]
Cartman	10	1	Damn, I'm pretty freakin' cool all of a sudden.	['damn']
Other	58	0	Ah! Here we see the ice man trying to gain Internet access on the computer. The Internet was still not very big in his time, so the Web frightens and confuses him.  It's okay, he can't hurt you.  It's one-way glass: he can't even see us.  And now the ice man watches television.	[]
Other	19	0	This grizzly bear has the strength of over ten Morgan Freemans. I'm really pissing him off right now.	[]
Other	5	0	Wait. This could be dangerous.	[]
Other	2	0	How so?	[]
Other	14	0	He's changing the channel. Something on the television could frighten and confuse him.	[]
Other	14	0	And they've done it! The Atlanta Falcons are going to the Super Bowl!	[]
Stan	10	0	You guys aren't being very nice to my creature.	[]
Kyle	4	0	He's my creature!	[]
Other	12	0	He's fine, boys. And we're learning so much from him.	[]
Stan	7	0	Let him out, dude. He's scared.	[]
Other	32	0	He would be more scared on the outside. Do you think this stuff freaks him out? How do you think he'd react to what's happening in the government right now?	[]
Kyle	5	0	But it isn't right!	[]
Other	14	0	Little boy, sometimes, what's right isn't as important as what's profitable.	[]
Kenny	3	0	(Uh oh. Ow!)	[]
Stan	6	0	Oh my God, they killed Kenny!	[]
Kyle	7	0	What?! I'm not talking to you!	[]
Stan	6	0	Gorak!  Gorak! Gorak! Are you there?	[]
Stan	22	0	I don't think it's fair for them to keep you captive like this, Gorak. I came to bust you out.	[]
Stan	5	0	What are you doing here?	[]
Kyle	7	0	I'm here to bust out Steve.	[]
Stan	11	0	What?! You can't. I'm here to bust out Gorak.	[]
Kyle	4	0	His name is Steve!	[]
Stan	4	0	His name is Gorak!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Steve!	[]
Stan	1	0	Gorak!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Steve!	[]
Stan	8	1	What kind of stupid-ass name is Steve?!	['ass']
Kyle	12	0	Because, he kinda like looks like Steve Austin, the $6 million man	[]
Stan	4	0	No he doesn't!!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Does so!	[]
Other	17	0	Uh. Hey, kids, could you just open the door so I can get back to my family?	[]
Stan	7	0	I found him, I'm rescuing him!	[]
Other	1	0	Thanks.	[]
Stan	4	1	You're a dick!	['dick']
Kyle	4	1	You're a dick!	['dick']
Stan	15	2	You're a dick, and I've had it with your dicketry! I choose you!	['dick', 'dicketry']
Kyle	10	0	You want a fight? Well, that's fine with me!	[]
Stan	8	0	Tomorrow at the bus stop, 4 o'clock!	[]
Kyle	9	0	Well, why don't we make 3 o'clock?	[]
Stan	8	0	Dude, Terrance and Phillip is on at 3.	[]
Kyle	10	2	Oh yeah.  Fine, I'll kick your ass tomorrow, dick!	['ass', 'dick']
Stan	22	2	I'll kick your ass so bad you'll wish you never had it- to begin with! Your ass, I mean.  Wait.	['ass', 'ass']
Other	13	0	I just smelled your britches and they're stinky Stinky Britches Stinky Britches	[]
Other	1	0	Arrrggh!	[]
Other	9	0	He's gone! The ice man has broken out!	[]
Other	8	0	No, that's impossible! How could he have?	[]
Other	6	0	He must have used this... door	[]
Other	4	2	Damn it, Damn it!	['damn', 'damn']
Other	14	0	We have to find him! He won't survive long out in the world!	[]
Other	19	0	Yes, and if he isn't found, we won't be able to use him for our military war-	[]
Other	1	0	Sshhhh!	[]
Other	1	0	Right.	[]
Other	1	0	What?	[]
Other	1	0	What?	[]
Other	1	0	Nothing.	[]
Other	10	0	No, what did you say? Uh, use him for what?	[]
Other	1	0	Butlutlutlutlup!	[]
Other	8	0	Dr. Mephesto, where could the creature have gone?	[]
Other	4	0	I have no idea!	[]
Other	15	0	We'll never track him down on our own. This calls for some special assistance.	[]
Other	4	0	Can I help you?	[]
Other	7	0	Leslie. It's me, Larry.  Your husband?	[]
Other	6	0	Husband? You're not my husband.	[]
Other	12	0	Think hard, Leslie. We used to be together, for over eight years?	[]
Other	18	0	I seem to remember a husband, but I think he was lost and never found on Kenosha Pass.	[]
Other	3	0	That was me!	[]
Other	1	0	Oh.	[]
Other	4	0	Who is it, lover?	[]
Other	11	0	It's my former husband, who I had forgotten all about.	[]
Other	25	0	Ooooo.  Well, sir, let me shake your hand. I'm proud to meet the man whose wife I'm currently sticking it to every night.	[]
Other	3	0	So you... remarried.	[]
Other	2	0	Yes, Lorry.	[]
Other	1	0	Larry!	[]
Other	38	0	Uhlarry. Larry-y, you disap-peared. I waited for you to come home for over three days! I. I remember how cold and lonely the nights got. By the fourth day I knew: I had to move on.	[]
Other	8	0	Didn't anybody send out a search party?	[]
Other	13	0	We did, Larry. We looked all afternoon. But we found nothing, no trace.	[]
Other	13	0	Please, Leslie, I don't know where else to go. I'm confused.	[]
Other	6	0	Leslie, I'm with Buck now.	[]
Other	3	0	You're Leslie.	[]
Other	29	0	Right. I'm with Buck now. We have children together.  Calvin is eight, and little Buck is 13. I just can't up and leave them. I'm sorry.	[]
Other	12	0	I'm sorry, too. I'll leave you alone.  Eight and thirteen?	[]
Cartman	9	0	Well, I don't see any crocs out here.	[]
Stan	20	1	Damnit, Cartman, you're supposed to be helping me to get ready to fight Kyle, not playing Australian outback guy!	['damnit']
Cartman	37	1	Or, in other words, I'll let this jagu-ar bop me in the face and see if it hurts. Come on, jagu-ar, let's see what you've got!  Aaah! Ow, son of a bitch!	['bitch']
Stan	7	0	You suck as a best friend, Cartman!	[]
Cartman	6	1	You son of a bitch cat!	['bitch']
Stan	5	0	What are you doing, Gorak!	[]
Other	12	0	I can't live in your time. I'm freezing myself again.	[]
Stan	4	0	Wow, that sucks, dude.	[]
Other	26	0	Tell me about it. I've been doing this for over three and a half hours now, and only my toes are starting to ice over.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Steve, wait!	[]
Stan	16	1	What are you doing here, dick?! We're not supposed to fight until 4 o'clock!	['dick']
Kyle	8	1	I've got something to show Steve, dick!	['dick']
Stan	7	1	Gorak is busy freezing himself again, dick!	['dick']
Kyle	9	0	Steve, you don't have to freeze yourself. Look!	[]
Other	3	0	What is that?	[]
Kyle	37	0	It's this place called Des Moines. It's like, lost in time, see?  Everybody looks like you do.  Fashion is two years behind, Technology is two years behind, fads, are two years behind, just like you.	[]
Other	1	0	Home.	[]
Kyle	9	0	Come on, Steve, you're going to Des Moines!	[]
Stan	18	0	Oh, no you don't, glory-monger! Gorak is my responsibility. I'll take him to Des Moines!	[]
Kyle	5	1	No you don't, butthole!	['butthole']
Other	5	0	They're coming for me!	[]
Stan	2	0	Come on!	[]
Cartman	18	0	Yeah, you jagu-ars can be real mean. I'm gonna have to smack it in the face.	[]
Other	5	0	Was the ice man here?	[]
Cartman	6	0	He might have been, by crikey.	[]
Other	11	0	We have to get him back. Well, can you do it?	[]
Other	8	0	Sure I can! I can hunt down anything!	[]
Cartman	3	1	Wow! Kick ass!	['ass']
Stan	10	0	We need a one-way ticket to Des Moines, please.	[]
Other	6	1	Des Moines? What the hell for?	['hell']
Kyle	7	0	We have to get our friend, Steve-	[]
Stan	3	0	My friend, Gorak!	[]
Stan	13	1	No, he's not gonna melt away! That's Frosty, you stupid butthole!	['butthole']
Kyle	3	0	Frosty, Steve, whatever.	[]
Other	9	0	Well, okay. Uh, I'll find him a seat.	[]
Stan	7	0	Dude, look, it's 4 o'clock.	[]
Kyle	15	0	Oh. We'll wait for you over there, Steve. We have to start fighting now.	[]
Other	3	0	Okay, boys. Thanks.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Okay. First one to die, loses.	[]
Stan	1	0	'K.	[]

Kyle	4	0	So, here we go.	[]
Stan	1	0	'K	[]
Kyle	1	0	Go.	[]
Other	10	0	Wait a second.  I think he came through here recently.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Yeah, I think the same thing.	[]
Other	16	1	Well, where the hell is he? We've got to get him back to the lab.	['hell']

Cartman	9	1	Yeah, calm down, calm down, you sons of bitches.	['bitches']
Other	2	0	Wait! Look!	[]
Other	3	0	Is it him?	[]
Other	62	2	No! It's a Rocky Mountain rattle snake.  This is the most poisonous snake in this entire region.  Now, what I'm gonna do, is carefully sneak up on him, and jam my thumb up his butthole. Crikey!  Oh, this snake is really pissed!! I'm gonna jam my thumb in his butthole now!  Awww, yeah, that pissed it off all right!	['butthole', 'butthole']
Other	5	0	Does he always do this?	[]
