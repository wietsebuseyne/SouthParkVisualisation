Mr. Mackey	227	8	M'kay, kids, as your counselor, I know it can sometimes be difficult to talk about subjects like drugs and sex and alcohol, m'kay? So, as you remember, last week I told you to write down any difficult questions you had and put them in this box anonymously so we could discuss in class, m'kay? I got a lot o' responses, so let's read some aloud.  Mr. Mackey is gay.  Okay kids, that is not funny! M'kay?! This box is supposed to be used for serious questions! About, about serious issues! M'kay, let's let's stop the tomfoolery!  M'kay, this looks like a real one here.  Dear Mr. Mackey, you are gay.  All right, all right. That's enough, kids. Let's quiet down and try to be mature, 'kay?  Uh here we go. Okay, Mr. Mackey, sometimes my parents hit me, and you are gay.  dammit, is there not one serious question in here?!  Mr. Mackey is gay, Mr. Mackey is gay  Okay, here.  I am a boy at South Park Elementary. Sometimes, when I'm sitting in class, my penis becomes hard for no reason. What should I do?  All right kids, all right kids, that's enough!  If you all can't be serious about the question box,  then we'll just do drug identification exercises, unkay?!

Cartman	13	1	Hey, that's bullcrap! How come Jimmy doesn't have to do it?!	['bullcrap']
Mr. Mackey	10	0	Well, because uh, Jimmy is pitching a tent right now.	[]
Stan	3	0	He's what??	[]
Stan	16	0	A hundred dollar gift certificate to South Park Mall?  Maybe we should do the talent show.	[]
Kyle	13	0	Well, what's the point? Jimmy always wins with his stand-up comedy.	[]

Other	14	0	Well fellas, entertainment is my life. I love being in front of everyone.  Aaah!	[]

Other	22	0	I gotta guh, I gotta go! See ya fellas.  Eh, excuse me! Evuh evuh - excuh, cuh, cuse me! Excuse me, puh-please.	[]
Craig	3	0	It's occupied.	[]
Cartman	7	0	No room at the inn, Virgin Mary.	[]
Butters	25	0	Hehey Jimmy!  M'boy, did you see that first prize for the talent show? Why you must be excited! You'll probably win like always.	[]
Other	18	0	Yeah. Yeah, I'm real excited. REAL excited... for some reason... Oh, Jesus! What's wrong with me?	[]
Butters	12	0	Hey, who's droppin' bombs in there?! How about a courtesy flush?!	[]
Cartman	3	0	Up yours, Butters.	[]
Other	5	0	Hey Jimmy, how was school?	[]
Other	2	0	Fine, Mom.	[]
Other	10	0	Jimmy, we understand you're getting erections in the classroom.	[]
Other	6	0	What? Uh who told you that?	[]
Other	4	0	Mr. Mackey, your counselor.	[]
Other	7	0	Aw J-j-j-j...j-Jesus!	[]
Other	46	0	Now, Jimmy, it's nothing to be ashamed of. But we know it's something you might have a hard time talking about. Get it? A hard time. So, we took your counselor's advice 'nd called Doctor Pal to help us all talk about this.	[]
Other	4	0	Dz-n-Doctor Pal?	[]
Other	22	0	Hey Jimmy, I'm Doctor Pal. That's because I'm a doctor, but I'm also your pal. Are we cool?	[]
Other	2	0	Uh, sure?	[]
Other	52	0	A lot of times parents call me in because I can relate to younger kids. I'm I'm down, I'm dope, you dig? Now, I understand you have some concerns about erections.  Oops, can't say erection in front of the parents right. Oh God, I feel so weird huh?	[]
Other	4	0	Well, a little, yes.	[]
Other	39	1	Jimmy, there's nothing weird about random erections. Almost every boy goes through a phase where his penis becomes hard... for no particular reason. It's just part of growing up. Growing up? Growing out is more like it.	['penis']
Other	14	0	But I have to make it stop! The talent show is this F-Friday.	[]
Other	21	0	Tell you what, Mom and Dad, why don't you skedaddle for a tick and let us hipsters talk in privo.	[]
Other	6	0	A-all right, come on, honey.	[]
Other	39	0	Jimmy, as you get older your body goes through a lot of changes. Certain hormones start to release as your whole reproductive system begins to awaken, and so, if you like, we can take off our shirts and kiss.	[]
Other	4	0	Ke...c-come again?	[]
Other	42	0	Oh, hey, nothin', you see? See, that set you off on a different tangent, got you thinkin' a different way. That's what Doctor Pal is here to do.  Unless, of course, you think we should take off our shirts and kiss.	[]
Other	13	0	N-no, I do NOT want to take off my shirt and kiss	[]
Other	17	1	Well then to hell with you, kid. You can just deal with your problems on your own.	['hell']
Other	16	0	Next up for the talent show, put your hands together for the incredibly talented Jimmy Valmer!	[]
Other	130	0	Wow, what a what a great audience. So apparently Martha Stewart is out of jail. Have you have you heard about this, have you seen this? She's very excited to get started on her new show, Martha Stewart Living, with an electronic ankle bracelet.  So it looks like the Vatican has finally chosen a new Pope. Have you seen this, have you heard about this?  A-a-apparently they're going to call him New Pope, a-and refer to John Paul as P-Pope Classic.  Uh,.. so it so it looks like Michael Jackson is having back problem in court.  You know... huh... you uh you know what they say about b-b-b-b-back problems.  Uh, uh gee, what a terrific audience.  What a fantastic audience.	[]

Butters	12	0	Oh Gosh, I'd never make fun of somebody with a problem.	[]
Other	15	1	Butters, do you know what you're supposed to do when your penis gets hard?	['penis']
Butters	4	0	Well sure I do.	[]
Other	1	0	Really??	[]
Butters	63	3	Yes, now sit down, Jimmy, we should have a little talk.  You see, Jimmy, when a man's penis becomes hard, the man puts it into a lady. Into her vagiiina.  Then, the hard penis sneezes milk inside the lady's tummy, and after it's all done sneezin' milk, the penis stops bein' hard, and the man loses interest in the lady.	['penis', 'penis', 'penis']
Other	23	2	So, when your penis becomes hard, you're supposed to put in in a lady's vagina. And then it stops being hard?	['penis', 'vagina']
Butters	4	0	That's right, Jimmy.	[]
Other	20	1	But where am I going to find a lady to stick my penis in? The talent show is this Friday.	['penis']

Cartman	9	1	Jimmy, Jimmy, what the hell are you doing, man?	['hell']
Other	11	0	I'm trying to get laid. What's it look like?	[]
Cartman	38	2	Dude, you don't just go up to a girl and ask her if you can stick your penis in her vagina. Ye-you have to ask her on a date, take her out for some Italian food.	['penis', 'vagina']
Other	16	0	Wow, seems like you know a lot about this stuff, Eric. Have you gotten laid before?	[]
Cartman	12	0	Sure, lots of times. I've been laid, like, five thousand times.	[]
Other	6	0	Well, wha-what do I do?	[]
Cartman	21	0	I told you: a date and then Italian food. And then you gotta make her think you're a good listener.	[]
Other	32	0	Eric, I can't tell you why, but it's very important that I score to-night! Can you come on the date and help me? You're like a white... Hitch.	[]
Cartman	36	0	Why sure, they do this all the time in movies and TV shows. You go on the date and wear an earpiece, and I'll be nearby, secretly telling you all the right things to say.	[]
Other	3	0	Wow! Thanks, Eric.	[]

Other	12	0	Uh, I think we're gonna try your authentic pizzareli casserona poppers.	[]

Other	14	0	You know that girl Sally Rauman at our school? I can't stand her.	[]
Cartman	26	0	Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy, even though what she's saying now isn't interesting at all, you say, Wow, that is very interesting. Please tell me more.	[]
Other	9	0	Wow, that is very interesting. Please tell me more.	[]
Other	32	0	Really? Well, Kelligan bought the same purse and I was like, No WAY do I want it now! because who wants a purse that both their best friends have, right? And so-	[]
Cartman	22	0	All right, when she stops yappin' again, say Wow, I've never thought of it that way before, but you're right.	[]
Other	12	0	I guess that's why I figured, Who needs friends like THAT?	[]
Other	14	0	Wow, I've never thought of it that way before, but you're right.	[]
Other	15	0	It's like I told Debbie: If you're gonna go out with my friends-	[]
Cartman	26	0	All right Jimmy, when she finally shuts her trap again, I want you to repeat whatever she said, and then follow it with Wow, how insightful.	[]
Other	17	0	And so if you're gonna be that way, I don't need to be your friend.	[]
Other	18	0	If you're gonna be that way, I don't need to be your friend. Wow, how insightful.	[]
Other	8	0	You know, Jimmy, you are a great listener.	[]

Other	12	1	Well of course not, Jimmy. Little girls don't wanna have sex.	['sex']
Other	28	2	Then why does God make it so that my penis gets hard if girls don't wanna have it in their vaginas? It's like a cruel joke.	['penis', 'vaginas']
