Towelie	6	0	Yep! And it's all true.	[]
Other	14	0	Chapters 4 through 8, however, seem to all be about Doritos Brand Corn Chips.	[]
Towelie	9	0	I guess I could edit those chapters down some.	[]
Other	20	0	Don't bother. I'm sorry to tell you this, sir, but nobody's ever going to publish your memoirs.	[]
Towelie	3	0	Huh? Why not?	[]
Other	15	0	Well, just the small trivial fact that... people aren't interested in autobiographies of towels.	[]
Towelie	18	0	Wull yeah, but, maybe people will read my memoirs and like, apply its lessons to their own lives.	[]

Towelie	4	0	You're a towel!	[]
Other	22	0	No. I'm a big book publisher who's not the least bit interested in your stony memoirs. You're a towel.	[]
Towelie	56	0	Now what am I gonna do? I gotta pay rent and I just wasted three weeks writin' my memoirs. It's time for me to stop bein' so irresponsible. I've gotta shape up, focus, an' come up with real solutions to my problems.  I'd better get a little high.  Oh, maybe I shouldn't.	[]
Other	14	0	But you have to think of somethin' fast, an' gettin' high makes you smart.	[]
Towelie	32	0	All right, I'll just use my special gettin'-high powers one more time.  Hey. Hey, wait a minute. Of course! That's it! Why didn't I think of it before?	[]

Towelie	3	0	McTowelie. Steven McTowelie.	[]
Other	48	0	It's heartbreaking passages like this one: I am a person who often gets hung out to dry by all those around me. I know this company would be honored to publish this book. I just have one small question first. You're not... a towel, are you?	[]
Towelie	17	0	...No. If I was a towel, why would I be wearin' this hat, an' this fake mustache?	[]
Other	32	0	Right, I'm sorry.  Well Steveen, if it's all right with you, I'm gonna to get our agents and lawyers on the phone right now. We're in business, sir.	[]
Towelie	2	0	All right!	[]
Other	71	0	Thank you so much.  Once in a while I come across a book that is sooo honest and sooo moving that it changes my life.  A Million Little Fibers is the true story about a man who was born in a laboratory. Please welcome author Stevem McTowelie!  Steven, when I read your book, I thought to myself, How can a human being go through all this and still turn out okay?	[]
Towelie	11	0	Well, I guess I'm just an extra-special tow-  person.	[]
Other	41	0	You talk in your book how you would sometimes have to spend days hung up on a rack. What would that do to you emotionally? You have been through... so much,  and I think that people all over America could benefit...	[]
Other	24	0	Oh God, there she goes again, babblin' about people's lives and carryin' on. She hasn't paid any attention to me in years!	[]
Other	10	0	...a life that kept getting up whenever it was down...	[]
Other	39	0	Nobody knows what it's like to be Oprah's minge. All she does is work, never gives her ol' minge a nice rub now and again. A minge needs attention! At least a scratch once in a while!	[]
Other	21	0	Well Steven, your book hasn't sold a lot of copies yet, but I have some pretty exciting news for you!	[]
Other	49	0	Used to be a time when Oprah would play with me night and day. She'd pet me for hours usin' every finger. Now I just sit here, in the dark, not even so much as a pinky! I should write a book! Be much more depressin' than his!	[]
Other	15	0	And so, Steven, I'm making your book my official Book of the Month selection!	[]
Towelie	9	0	Really?  Wow. I'm gonna get super-rich now.	[]
Other	41	0	Uh huh, okay. Well listen, maybe we can get her in as a guest on the 19th. All right, is John Travolta available to be a guest the week after that? Okay, that might work better since it's Sweeps Week.	[]
Other	35	0	Can't take it anymore. All she ever does is work work work, never pays attention to the ol' minge. I'm always trapped in these stuffy pantsuits. I want attention! I'm bloody bored!	[]
Other	11	0	Oh stop your complainin'! I'm tryin' to sleep back here.	[]
Other	8	0	Ay, 'oo's that? Is that you, Gary?	[]
Other	21	0	Yes it's me. You think you've go' it bad? Oprah hasn't paid any attention to me in years.	[]
Other	17	1	Oh, what do you care? You're just an asshole. I'm a minge! Minges need stimulation.	['asshole']
Other	48	2	Assholes need stimulation too, you bastard! I want to travel. I want to see Paris. I thought lamp was goin' to get better, but Oprah's always busy. Werkin' and werkin', diyatin' and not diyatin'. I need a pukin' up mounds of chocolate cake or teaspoons of weedgrass.	['assholes', 'bastard']
Other	26	0	She's a workaholic. Let's face it: the only way we're ever goin' tuh get any attention is if Oprah doesn't work anymore.	[]
Other	5	0	Well that'll never happen.	[]
Other	5	0	Not unless she gets fired.	[]
Other	6	0	Fired... You got a plan, Mingie?	[]

Other	5	0	Ooo. How d'you know?	[]
Other	37	0	I'm a minge. Minges know a towel when they hear one. If evidence gets out that Oprah's champion author is a towel, she'll look right foolish. Fans'll start droppin' off by the millions.	[]
Other	5	0	'Ow do we get proof?	[]
Other	15	0	We get somebody else to do it. The greatest investiga'ive reporter of our time.	[]

Other	33	0	We need to tell the audience why you changed some of the facts in your book; that you thought it necessary to heighten certain things to make the book more relevant to people.	[]
Towelie	2	0	Hey yeah.	[]
Other	26	0	Just come on the show and explain in a very level-headed way that changing some facts shouldn't matter if the book helps people, okay?	[]
Towelie	8	0	Okay. Thanks Oprah! You're a real friend.	[]

Towelie	40	0	All right, I got one chance here. I need to focus and come up with what I'm gonna say.  Maybe I should get a little high.  No! Wait a minute! I'm not going to get high this time.	[]
