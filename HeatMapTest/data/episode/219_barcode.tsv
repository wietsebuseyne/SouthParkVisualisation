Cartman	28	0	Okay okay, so what do we call Pete Melman when we see him? I was thinking, Poopypants Pete, but th- but then I also thought of Mushpants Melman.	[]
Mr. Mackey	19	0	Attention South Park Students: will the following students report to the Principal's office immediately? Eric Cartman? Thank you.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Oh Jesus, what now?!	[]
Other	19	0	Eric, as you might have heard, a student here in South Park Elementary had an accident in the classroom.	[]
Cartman	12	1	Puh-I know, dude. Pete Melman crapped his pants. So freakin' funny!	['crapped']
Other	20	0	Oookay, but you probably understand that for Pete, it isn't that funny. For him it's embarrassing and terrifying.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Tchehe, right. That's why it's super funny to me.	[]
Other	24	0	Eric, it has been almost one year since Corey Duran defecated in his pants here in school. Now, you remember what happened to him?	[]
Cartman	4	0	Yeah, he killed himself.	[]
Mr. Mackey	23	0	Yes, and the reason he killed himself, Eric, was that the ridicule and the torment from other students,  spearheaded by you, cause him-!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Hey! Whoooa.	[]
Mr. Mackey	14	0	Spearheaded by you, m'kay, made him feel there was no other way out.	[]
Cartman	30	1	'Kay, whoa, whoa! We've been through this, you cannot put Corey Duran's death on me! I'm not the one who crapped him pants in front of everyone!	['crapped']
Other	20	0	Eric, we are asking you to please just remember what happened to Corey and not let it happen to Pete.	[]
Other	5	0	Please just let it go.	[]
Cartman	42	1	You're asking me to simply ignore a kid who - excuse my language but I have to be harsh here - a kid who shits in his pants in front of everyone - to just ignore that so he can have a normal life?!	['shits']
Mr. Mackey	21	0	We are hoping that if you don't fan the flames, Eric, the other students might forget might forget about it!	[]
Cartman	40	1	Do you really think information like this will just die down? There's Internet! There's Eavesdropper! You might be worried Pete Melman is gonna kill himself, but the truth is, he was dead the second he crapped his pants.	['crapped']
Other	29	0	Alright Eric, here's the deal: This school cannot have another suicide on its hands. We want you to see Pete Melman through this, and turn public opinion around.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Heh! You're crazy! It can't be done!	[]
Other	15	0	If Pete Melman does not kill himself,  we will make it very worth your while.	[]
Cartman	12	0	You aren't listing to anythin-  Make it worth my while how?	[]
Stan	2	0	No way.	[]
Kyle	3	0	What's up?	[]
Stan	18	0	The-hay've got a video of Pete Melman's mom showing up with fresh underwear on Eavesdropper!	[]
Kyle	5	1	Dude, that's fucked up.	['fucked']
Stan	7	0	Come on dude, it's pretty funny.	[]
Kyle	21	0	It's funny that something that should be completely private is put up on a Web site for everyone to see??	[]

Cartman	47	0	I know. Ah I know you don't like me back. I ju- Yeah, you know, the- this was stupid, I'm sorry. Will you just take a cupcake?  Oh, don't take the cupc- I, I'm sorry. I, I'm sorry I wasted your time.	[]
Other	20	0	Hey. Wait.  Look, I'm sorry. That was mean. I'd love to try one of your mom's cupcakes.	[]

Other	9	0	Gah I just need to go to the restroom!	[]
Mr. Garrison	2	0	Well okay.	[]
Cartman	25	0	Ah, Mr. Garrison, I don't think that's quite fair, uh I mean, you rarely let us get up and leave during the class.	[]
Other	6	0	Please! I've gotta go now!	[]
Cartman	15	0	Well just, give it a couple of minutes, Jenny. It could just be a cramp.	[]

Butters	1	0	Sick!	[]
Cartman	2	0	WAY worse!	[]
Other	1	0	Run.	[]
Other	18	0	...The Doctors say that Jenny Simon barely survived the fall. Jumping off the school roof fractured her pelvis.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Alright, kewl.	[]
Mr. Mackey	17	0	No, not cool! M'kay, she's on suicide watch, Eric! She's given up on life!	[]
Cartman	28	1	You said Pete Melman couldn't kill himself! By making Jenny Simon crap her pants worse than Pete, I've made her the number one story on Eavesdropper!	['crap']
Other	21	0	That's wasn't the point, Eric! Nobody was supposed to kill themselves! Unless you fix this our deal is off!	[]
Cartman	14	1	Mobody can be made fun of for crapping their pants, and nobody can die!	['crapping']
Other	1	0	Yes!	[]
Cartman	27	0	Jesus Christ!  Okay, okay.  Um, Jesus-  ah... Okay, look.  Okay those, those tests we took last week? The state efficiency tests? How did we do on those?	[]
Mr. Mackey	8	0	Our students did average, maybe just below average.	[]
Cartman	72	2	Okay, no, they all did awesome! In fact our students did so good on the tests that you...  you decided to reward them all. At lunch you're serving the students pizza from Pizza Hut! But we're going to put laxatives and Arby's horsey sauce in the pizza so that every kid in the school craps their pants after recess. Everyone craps their pants, nobody's singled out, problem solved.	['craps', 'craps']
Other	3	0	That's insane!	[]
Cartman	13	0	Okay, well if you have a better idea, then why am I here?	[]
Mr. Mackey	37	0	Uh, hi Jan, it's Counselor Mackey. Uh... how long would it take to organize a Pizza Friday for the students? Yeah, yeah no they uh, they actually did really well on the state exam. Yeah, mkay.	[]
Stan	19	0	Dude, check it out! Eavesdropper found an e-mail from Jenny Simon's boyfriend calling her soft-serve Simon.	[]
Kyle	4	0	That's not funny.	[]
Craig	13	0	Hey, here's a post about Token: Token Black's Private Gym Photos	[]
Kyle	6	0	I'm not looking at that!	[]
Stan	7	0	Come on, dude, it's pretty funny!	[]
Kyle	13	0	It wouldn't be funny if that Web site posted something about you!	[]
Stan	4	0	I wouldn't care.	[]
Craig	11	1	Exclusive: Stan Marsh thinks Elise Thompson has a hot butt crack.	['butt']
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Craig	46	2	In an email sent yesterday to KENNY McCormick, Stan Marsh wrote 'Dude, you should have been in PE today. Elise Thompson's butt crack was totally showing.' He went on to call her butt crack quote 'nice' and that the whole experience was quote 'pretty awesome'.	['butt', 'butt']
Stan	5	1	Kenny! Kenny, what the fuck?!	['fuck']
Kenny	1	0	(What?)	[]
Stan	12	0	How did Eavesdropper get a hold of my e-mail to you?!	[]
Kenny	4	0	(I don't know.)	[]
Stan	12	0	Do you just leave your e-mails open for everyone to read?!	[]
Kenny	1	0	(No!)	[]
Stan	12	0	That was a private e-mail from me to you!  Hey Wendy.	[]
Wendy	8	1	You like looking at girls' butt cracks, Stan?!	['butt']
Kenny	8	1	(Oh fuck I'm gettin' out of here!)	['fuck']
Stan	9	0	No, I was telling Kenny he would like it.	[]
Wendy	9	0	Do you have any idea how embarrassed I am?!	[]
Stan	25	0	Wendy, it was just a quick e-mail to Kenny. New stories pop up on Eavesdropper every hour. People are gonna forget all about this.	[]
Wendy	15	1	So you didn't e-mail anybody else about Elise Thompson's butt crack, right?!	['butt']
Stan	26	0	This is an issue of trust and privacy! We have to all work together to put an end to Eavesdropper once and for all!  Yes, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	12	0	So, just to be completely clear, now it isn't funny, right?	[]
Stan	11	0	Ugh, What's funny about having our private lives hacked into?!	[]
Wendy	12	0	Specially when they're writing about your boyfriend's addiction to crack.	[]
Stan	50	1	Shut up Butters! What we have to find out is who in the school is running Eavesdropper! I've done an extensive profile, and I've narrowed it down to somebody in this very room!  Now whoever you are, you're a gossiping little bitch!  And we're not gonna-!	['bitch']
Craig	7	0	It's not somebody in this room.	[]
Stan	5	0	What? How do you know?	[]
Craig	26	0	Because whoever it is just now posted a new story on Eavesdropper: Allison Taft reveals embarrassing secret about Craig Tucker.  Yeah. Hey wait, that's me.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Where is it coming from?	[]
Craig	1	0	Huh?	[]
Kyle	27	0	If it's on the school network we can track the IP address.  This way. In here.  Whoever it is using the computer in the music room.	[]
Stan	7	0	We only have music class on Thursday.	[]
Wendy	14	0	Of course. A kid could use the computer in there and nobody would know.	[]
Kyle	22	0	Get ready guys. Whoever is in here is the kid that's hacking our e-mails and phone calls! You guys ready?!	[]
Stan	4	0	Oh I'm ready!	[]
Kyle	3	0	One.  Two. Three!	[]
Craig	4	0	It's a rat!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Get it!	[]
Stan	6	0	Don't let him get away!	[]
Token	3	0	He's gone!	[]
Stan	11	1	What the hell? A stupid rat is in charge of Eavesdropper?	['hell']
Kyle	8	0	Wikileaks.  It says here his name is Wikileaks.	[]
Other	38	0	Lemmiwinks! I come with news of great gravity. Another rodent is out there, spreading terrible rumors and hacking e-mails.  Yes. And I'm afraid the news is worse. The creature doing this, Lemmiwinks, is your brother, Wikileaks!	[]
Other	25	1	''Wikileaks, the bum hacker with a heart of doom.Everyone knows the gerbil king, but no one ever speaksOf Lemminwinks's brother, the evil Likiweaks...	['bum']
Other	17	0	Once again Wikileaks is trying to wreak havoc on our world. Only you can stop him, Lemmiweaks.	[]
Other	9	0	Lemmiwinks, King of Gerbils, stop your brother of doom!	[]
Other	17	0	It's just so embarrassing. What if the other girls find out my mother is in rehab?	[]
Other	17	0	It's okay Emily. Can I tell you a secret? My mom has a drinking problem too.	[]
Other	3	0	Really? You too?	[]
Other	6	0	That's just between us, okay?	[]
Other	12	0	Of course, Tammy. I'm really glad I shared this with you.	[]
Stan	3	0	Stop that rat!	[]
Stan	3	0	Knock it off!	[]
Other	16	0	I just want you to know that I have a hure crush on you and-  HEY!	[]
Butters	3	0	NO Wikileaks! Bad!	[]
Cartman	18	0	Yup, a few more laxatives on that one, a little more Arby's horsey sauce on there, mhm.	[]
Mr. Mackey	5	0	Eh, Is this one good?	[]
Cartman	7	0	Yeah, I think they're all ready.	[]
Other	17	0	You sure this will work, Eric? What if some of the students don't eat the pizza?	[]
Cartman	21	1	It doesn't matter. Enough students will crap their pants to make everyone forget about Pete Melman and Jenny Simons forever.	['crap']
Mr. Mackey	19	0	Alright Eric, well, well get back to class. We don't want anyone seeing you in here with us.	[]
Cartman	32	0	Uh, hold on just a second! I believe we discussed the little matter of my payment?!  I'm not letting you guys screw me over again. Give me what I wanted, now!	[]
Mr. Mackey	6	0	Alright, fine. Bring her in, Adler.	[]
Cartman	12	0	Oh my God! Selena Gomez! You  you actually got her to come!	[]
Other	15	0	Hi Eric. I understand you really wanted to meet me. Wanna get a picture together?	[]
Cartman	4	0	No thanks. Okay, proceed.	[]
Mr. Mackey	15	1	I/m sorry about this, Ms. Gomez.  Alright, get her the fuck out of here.	['fuck']
Other	10	0	Okay, Eric, you got what you wanted. Are we straight?	[]
Cartman	3	0	That. Was. Amazing.	[]
Mr. Mackey	41	1	Alright now, get back to class! Adler, get rid of those laxative bottles! Trash all the Arby's horsey sauce packages too! There cannot be one piece of evidence of what we did here!  What the?  Oh shit!  Stop that rat!	['shit']
Other	26	0	Alright Lemmiwinks, we should probably get going now... The time is nigh, Lemmiwinks. Let us chase your destiny.  Ah! Sparrow Prince! What news do you bring?	[]
Other	21	0	Wikileaks grows stronger with each passing moment.  The birds are tweeting that he is about to release his biggest story yet.	[]
Other	24	0	Then the moment is truly here! Come Lemmiwinks! Let us make haste! Le-le-Lemmiwinks? His heart is so heavy. I weep for him.	[]
Other	13	0	Indeed. Could you do it, Frog Prince? Could you kill your own brother?	[]
Other	20	0	I thank God I don't have to make that decision.  We might need to bring in some outside help.	[]
Stan	16	0	You see? There, look! It says Eavesdropper's biggest story every is coming out this afternoon.	[]
Butters	4	0	Biggest story about who?	[]
Craig	11	0	There's no telling. It could be about any of us.	[]
Other	8	0	Well met, children of Adam. I, am Catatafish.	[]
Other	5	0	Catatafish of the Salmon School.	[]
Kyle	1	0	What?	[]
Other	23	0	I come asking for your help. There is only one thing that can stop Wikileaks. But right now Lemmiwinks is being held prisoner.	[]
Stan	5	0	Lemmiwinks? Our old class gerbil?	[]
Kyle	4	0	What is that thing?	[]
Other	24	0	I am Catatafish. I am a great wizard and, I am a friend. And I'm a ghost, besides of course being a fish.	[]
Other	7	0	Catatafish's tale will soon be told.	[]
Stan	21	0	Do you know why a gerbil is running around hacking our phone calls and putting our secrets up on the Internet?	[]
Other	101	1	He does it purely for reasons of evil. And his treachery is not limited to humans. Wikileaks posted exaggerated things about me, too. He posted on his Web site that I had sex with an underage fish, and that I made her perform bass to mouth. If you accept this quest you will help the Gerbil King defeat Wikileaks once and for all! But the choice is yours. I'm not here to make you do anything. Like that underage salmon. I didn't make her do anything. If she wants to do bass to mouth, how is it my fault?	['sex']
Other	6	1	Catatafish made a salmon suck asshole.	['asshole']
Other	11	0	No! No, see, that's wrong! It's being exaggerated again!	[]
Kyle	16	0	Just tell us where Lemmiwinks is being held prisoner so we can kill this stupid rat!	[]
Other	55	2	Careful child! I assure you, Wikileaks is anything but stupid, except when he said I made that teenage fish perform ass to trout. That was stupid and untrue. Did I say ass to trout? I meant to say bass to mouth, though I guess it's basically the same thing, not that I did it.	['ass', 'ass']
Other	7	0	Alright, are we sure we're alone?	[]
Mr. Mackey	11	1	We're alone, now what the hell are we gonna do?	['hell']
Other	10	0	What can we do? We're all gonna get fired!	[]
Other	13	0	This story hasn't gone up on Eavesdropper yet. Maybe it won't!	[]
Mr. Mackey	18	0	Oh right! The School Faculty Tries To Poison All Their Students. That's not gonna be on Wikileaks!	[]
Other	23	0	Oh, let's just face it: We made our beds when we enlisted Eric Cartman's help. We have to lie in them.	[]
Mr. Mackey	20	0	All we were tryin' to do was keep another one of our students from killing themselves! We're not bad!	[]
Other	6	0	No, no, we're not bad.	[]
Mr. Mackey	43	0	We're not bad. I mean, maybe what we needed was just to think outside the box here. I mean, if there's anything we've learned is that the only thing that makes a juicy story go away is a juicier story.	[]
Other	12	0	What's a bigger story than all the students being made sick?	[]
Other	4	0	Our students committing suicide?	[]
Mr. Mackey	38	0	Hey that's right. Corey Duran killed himself last year and we're STILL dealing with the fallout. Maybe there is a way out of this. But we're gonna have to throw Eric Cartman under the bus.	[]
Other	5	0	How do we do that?	[]
Mr. Mackey	12	0	We get a bus... and then we... throw Eric Cartman under it.	[]
Other	1	0	Yes?	[]
Stan	7	0	Hi. Does a Vernon Trumski live here?	[]
Other	5	0	Yes, Vernon's around somewhere.	[]
Stan	3	0	Come on, guys!	[]
Other	2	0	Excuse me.	[]
Butters	6	0	There he is!  It's Lemmiwinks!	[]
Stan	8	0	Quick, we need something to carry him in!	[]
Kyle	4	0	Here's a shoebox!	[]
Other	8	0	Hey! What are you doing with my gerbil?!	[]
Stan	7	0	We just need to borrow him, kid.	[]
Other	7	0	MOOOM! SOME KIDS ARE STEALING MY GERBIL!	[]
Stan	23	0	Look dude, we don't have much time. Wikileaks is about to post his biggest scoop ever on Eavesdropper! Lemmiwinks can stop him!	[]
Other	1	0	MOOOM!	[]
Other	10	0	There's no time, children! You must take Lemmiwinks now!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Grab him!	[]
Other	1	0	MOOOM!	[]
Other	4	0	Go Lemmiwinks! Stop Wikileaks!	[]
Other	7	0	Quickly! We must get to the school!	[]
Stan	4	0	Whoa whoa wait, wait!	[]
Other	15	0	Run, run, the battle's on! Wikileaks and Lemmiwinks. Run, run, the battle's on!	[]
Stan	7	0	Can't this thing go any faster?	[]
Butters	3	0	Hang on, Lemmiwinks!	[]

Other	9	0	Faster driver! The final battle is about to begin!	[]
Other	4	0	Go Lemmiwinks! Stop Wikileaks!	[]
Kyle	4	1	What the hell happened?!	['hell']
Mr. Mackey	57	1	Oh! Oh God! Oh God he killed himself! Eric Cartman killed himself! Did you see that? Oh why would he do it?  Oh wait uh here, here's a suicide note. Mkay.  Dear Guys, I just cannot go on mkay. I'm tired of being FAT, mkay, and I have to end it all. Mkay. -Eric Cartman.	['fat']
Stan	25	0	Please, can this wait? A big story is about to about to come out on Eavesdropper and we have the only way to stop it!	[]
Mr. Mackey	14	1	Well why the hell didn't you say so! Come on, let's go!	['hell']
Other	3	0	Go by car!	[]
Other	4	0	Go Lemmiwinks! Stop Wikileaks!	[]
Other	8	0	Quickly, while Lemmiwinks still has it in him!	[]
Other	15	0	Run, run, the battle's on! Wikileaks and Lemmiwinks. Run, run, the battle's on!	[]
Stan	6	0	Stop right there, you little rat!	[]
Other	17	0	Go Lemmiwinks! Stop Wikileaks! Run, run, the battle's on! Wikileaks and Lemmiwinks. Go Lemmiwinks! Stop Wikileaks!	[]

Other	7	1	Oh dude, he is fucking him up!	['fucking']
Butters	6	0	Look! I think Lemmiwinks killed him!	[]
Other	3	0	He did it!	[]
Mr. Mackey	10	0	Okay, let's just delete all this tabloid garbage, mkay.	[]
Stan	9	0	Phew. I'm sure glad that's over with.	[]
Kyle	19	0	Yeah, but you know? I think we all learned an important lesson about laughing at other people's misfortunes.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Boy, I say.	[]
Mr. Mackey	27	0	Oh Eric! Uh, Eric, I know we kinda threw you under the bus, mkay, but I hope you understand the faculty didn't really have a choice.	[]
Cartman	10	0	It's okay Mr. Mackey. I'm totally over it.	[]
Mr. Mackey	29	0	Well I think you're being very mature about this, Eric. It was an overly generous move to give all the faculty those cupcakes. I wanna thank you. Mkay.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Oh, you're most certainly welcome.	[]
Mr. Mackey	11	0	Well students, why don't we uh-  Oooh. Oh, gee, uh...	[]
Cartman	6	0	Are you feeling okay, Mr. Mackey?	[]
Mr. Mackey	28	0	Yeah, I j-I just uh I'll be right back. Oh!  Aaaah! Oh it's bad!  Excuse me kids, I need to run, I gotta WUUGH!  OW!	[]
