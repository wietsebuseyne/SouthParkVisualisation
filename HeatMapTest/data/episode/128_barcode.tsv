Other	32	0	Children, children, we have a very special announcement.  Your classmate, Token, has just returned from winning the Colorado Child Star Contest with his incredible singing! Well let's give him a hand!	[]
Stan	2	0	Token sings?	[]
Cartman	7	0	Of course he sings. He's black.	[]
Other	30	0	Token is going to sing in front of a huge audience at the Miss Colorado Pageant in Denver. And for doing it he's gonna be paid two hundred dollars.	[]
Other	1	0	Whoa!	[]
Stan	3	0	Two hundred dollars.	[]
Other	31	0	Now of course, as a woman, I'm a bit against those chauvinistic pageants, but I hope that you children take a moment today to congratulate Token for being so special.	[]
Stan	7	0	Wow, two hundred dollars. Can you imagine?	[]
Kyle	8	0	How come we never get opportunities like that?	[]
Cartman	7	0	You wanna know what it is, guys?	[]
Kyle	4	0	We're not talented?	[]
Cartman	19	0	That's right. We're not talented. See, we're not the artistic side, we're the thinking side.	[]
Stan	8	0	Yeah. We're too smart to be talented.	[]
Cartman	26	0	Wait, you guys! I just had an amazing idea. Token is going right to the top, right. I mean, he's gonna be a huge star.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Probably.	[]
Cartman	26	0	So, why shouldn't we get some of that money? We can be Token's agents. That way, we get ten percent of whatever he makes!	[]
Stan	12	0	Hey yeah! We deserve that money just as much as he does.	[]
Cartman	43	0	We just need a really kickass office and some nice suits. A and a fountain in our lobby. All top agencies have fountains in their lobbies. We gotta make Token think he needs us, when actually he doesn't need us at all.	[]
Stan	6	0	He's looking at the sign.	[]
Cartman	15	0	Perfect! All right, you guys get back to the office, I'll bring Token there.	[]
Stan	2	0	All right.	[]
Cartman	30	0	Wait a minute! You guys, this is very important: when I bring Token back to the office, have Kenny hide in another room, and call the phone on my desk.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Why?	[]
Cartman	26	0	Because I'll answer and pretend I'm talking to somebody super famous and important. When Token sees that, maybe he'll think we're legit.	[]
Stan	3	0	It's genius.	[]
Cartman	25	0	Okay, go go, here he comes.  Yeah? Well then tell him we're just not interested.  Oh hey, Token! Buddy, my man, what is up?!	[]
Token	1	0	Nothin'	[]
Cartman	15	0	Hey, you know, I heard you were doing some thing down in Denver tomorrow night.	[]
Token	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Cartman	53	0	Yeah I don't know if I ever told you this before, but I'm actually an agent over at the Super Awesome Talent Agency. You may have seen our ads around town. Anyway, why don't you come down to the office, Token? Maybe I can convince the company to represent you.	[]
Token	9	0	I'm supposed to be home by 3:30.	[]
Cartman	6	0	This will only take a second.	[]
Cartman	40	0	Welcome to our offices, Token. As you can see, we are quite a successful company. Did you notice the fountain? Pretty nice, hm?  Come on over this way, Token.  Guys, you remember Token. He's thinking about becoming a client.	[]
Stan	11	0	Ohhhh Token. Right, yeah, you're makin' a smart move, man.	[]
Cartman	29	0	Now, Token, I I know what you're saying to yourself: You're saying, Hey, why do I need an agency? Why should I give them ten percent? Right?	[]
Token	1	0	...Yeah?	[]
Cartman	58	0	Token, the truth is that without representation, you're in danger of being taken advantage of.  Uh uh, excuse me just a second, Token.  Super Awesome Talent Agency. Oh yes, hello! How are you, Abraham Lincoln?  Yeah, yeah, no, I'm happy you called, Abraham Lincoln. I'm just sort of in the middle of something right now.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Can I talk to you?!	[]
Cartman	8	0	I'll I'll call you back, Abe.	[]
Kyle	6	1	What the hell are you doing?!	['hell']
Cartman	10	0	I'm making it look like important people call us.	[]
Kyle	9	0	Abraham Lincoln has been dead for two hundred years!	[]
Cartman	6	0	...well Token doesn't know that.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Yes he does!	[]
Cartman	1	0	How?!	[]
Kyle	9	0	Token actually pays attention in school! Unlike you, fatass!	[]
Cartman	1	1	Jew!	['jew']
Stan	8	0	You guys, we're gonna lose our client.	[]
Cartman	24	0	Yes, yes, I think that's a good idea, guys. Let's give Michael Jordan a call about that.  Ah, now, where were we?	[]
Token	10	0	We were at why I should give you ten percent.	[]
Stan	41	0	Look, Token, here's the bottom line. You're gonna start having a lot of offers comin' at you from all directions. A media storm is about to hit you and you can't handle it on your own. Nobody can.	[]
Kyle	17	0	Eminem, Justin Timberlake, Hootie... They all have agents. You need somebody to manage it all for you.	[]
Stan	19	0	This thing in Denver is is just the crust, Token. With our support, you can have the whole pie.	[]
Token	8	0	Well, I guess that makes sense. All right.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Uh if... we could just get you to sign right here?	[]
Kyle	5	0	Welcome to the team, Token.	[]
Stan	7	0	Ah Kenny, Token just signed with us!	[]

Token	30	0	Whoa, I'm not braggin' on myself, babyBut I'm the one who loves youAnd there's no one else! No-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh one else.	[]
Other	14	0	Just between us girls, nothin' gets my vadge wetter than a black man singing.	[]
Other	7	0	Mr. Garrison, for the love of God.	[]
Token	31	0	... (you're gonna miss my lovin')I know you're gonna my lovin' (you're gonna miss my lovin')You're gonna miss, you're gonna miss my lo-o-ove.	[]
Stan	4	0	You were awesome, Token!	[]

Cartman	14	0	Two hundred dollars, Token, that's great! And ten percent of two hundred is...	[]
Kyle	2	0	Twenty dollars.	[]
Token	3	0	Here you go.	[]
Kenny	2	0	(All right!)	[]
Cartman	1	0	Sweet!	[]
Stan	20	0	This is just the beginning. I bet we start to see all kinds of offers comin' in for Token now.	[]

Other	30	0	Mm, no. Uh, look, Token, there's some shows in LA we wanna book you on right away. If you come out to my limo we can talk everything through.	[]
Token	4	0	Oh my God! Okay!	[]
Cartman	5	0	Token, you signed with us!	[]
Token	16	0	Oh, come on, guys. You have to see what a huge opportunity this is for me.	[]
Cartman	17	0	What?! Uh they're not so great! They probably don't have a fountain in their lobby!	[]
Other	7	0	Actually, our fountain is two stories tall.	[]
Cartman	1	0	...Oooo...	[]
Other	10	0	Come on, Token, we have a lot to talk about.	[]
Kyle	8	0	Mister, you can't do this to us!	[]
Other	21	0	Sorry kids, nature of the business, you know?  Do you like steak, Token? I know a great place for you locally.	[]
Cartman	1	1	...Goddamnit!	['goddamnit']
Stan	4	0	So unfair... so unfair.	[]
Kyle	16	0	All that time and effort we spent helping Token and this is the thanks we get?!	[]

Kyle	6	0	Dude, maybe we should give up!	[]
Stan	22	0	No! Screw that, dude! If we keep letting CAA take all our clients, we're never gonna make it as talent agents!	[]
Cartman	13	0	Yeah, if these talent agents wanna play rough, we can play rough too!	[]

Kyle	5	0	Her life belongs to us!	[]
Stan	63	0	Guys! Guys! Guys! Don't you see what we're doing? Jesus... we're not talking about an object here, we're, we're talking about a person. I mean, look at what we've all become. All this violence and anger and, and for what? For control over somebody's life who... w-we're all just trying to leech off of.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Stan	23	0	Wing doesn't belong to us or to you. We're all just caught up in a business that treats people like commodities.	[]
Other	23	0	Perhaps... you're right. We spend all this time... mooching off the hopes and dreams of others, forgetting that they are human beings.	[]
Kyle	8	0	Yeah. It's not a very satisfying feeling.	[]
Other	14	0	I am tired of this business. It is a very dirty and perverse business.	[]
Stan	7	0	It's a lousy business. I quit.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Me too.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Aw aw guys, come on!	[]
Other	28	0	We quit too.  It's time for us to find another way to make money. From now on, all contracts we have on people are null and void.	[]
Other	2	0	All right!	[]
Other	30	0	Mr. Stallone thanks all of you for coming to his son's wedding. And now as a special treat, it is his pleasure to give you the music of... Wing!	[]

Other	12	0	Boys, thank you so much for eveything. You rearry helped us out.	[]
Other	24	0	Yes, you were right, kids. Her voice is so beautiful.  To think we would have made it so nobody would ever hear her sing.	[]
Stan	15	0	I think we all learned it's best to leave talent to the talented people.	[]
Token	7	0	Send a cress in your plates, folks?	[]
Kyle	1	0	Token?	[]
Token	9	0	Oh... Hey guys.  What, what are you doin' here?	[]
Cartman	5	0	Token, you're... waiting tables?	[]
Token	23	0	Yeah. Well, it turns out an agency doesn't really do anything for you.  I'm trying to work my way back home.	[]
Cartman	24	0	Aw man, that's too bad, Token. Hey, could you bring us some more bread, huh? Oh and some more olive oil. Chop chop!	[]
Other	7	0	My God, her voice is sooo beautiful!	[]
