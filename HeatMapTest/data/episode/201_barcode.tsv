Other	39	1	Saigon. It's a hell of a place. I've seen a lot of death.  A lot of suffering. Darkness that most people couldn't stand to see.  I tried to sit it out as much as I could.	['hell']
Other	12	0	What's the matter, Conner? You don't like a little blood?	[]
Other	28	0	No, I don't like a little blood. Blood ain't the stuff for eighteen year old boys from Sheboygan. Blood ain't the stuff... for Mitch Conner.	[]
Other	1	0	Incoming!	[]
Other	6	0	Conner, Mitchell. You're discharged, son.	[]
Other	71	0	And that's that. Pack your bags, you're headed home. Hugs and kisses from Uncle Sam.  So how do I end up here, with a nine year old kid who just wants to know who his father is? Life is funny like that. One day you're sifting through the guts of some gook in Vietnam and the next you're playing Dr. Phil with some kid and his teacher.	[]
Mr. Garrison	13	0	Eric I,  I'm really sorry that you were put through all this.	[]
Other	21	0	Sorry is a four letter word with a y on the end. That doesn't mean anything to this poor kid.	[]
Cartman	8	0	That's right! Tell me the truth! Now!	[]
Mr. Garrison	41	0	All I can tell you, Eric, is that we were all told to stick to the story, to protect someone very important. I can't say more, I won't. But I'll... I'll tell you who has the answer.	[]
Randy	12	1	Look, gingers! You said you wanted Muhammad, we got him for you.	['gingers']
Other	17	0	We have no way of knowing if Muhammad is really in there. It could be a trick.	[]
Stan	19	0	It's no trick, dude. My friend and I went to the Super Best Friends and brought him here!	[]
Other	17	0	Then have him step out of the bear costume! You have until the count of ten! One!	[]
Other	13	0	Don't do it, Randy. If Muhammad is seen, we could get bombed.	[]
Other	1	0	Two!	[]
Other	13	0	Idiot, if he isn't seen, we're about to definitely get bombed.	[]
Other	1	0	Three!	[]
Randy	22	0	Alright, alright, stop! We'll do what you say.  I'm sorry, Muhammad. Will you please step out of the bear costume?	[]
Stan	7	0	Okay, so um, see? This is Muhammad.	[]
Other	8	0	That isn't Muhammad, that's Santy Claus.	[]
Other	4	0	Sorry, boys. I tried.	[]
Kyle	2	1	Aw crap.	['crap']
Randy	8	0	Boys, you got Santa to be Muhammad? When?	[]
Stan	25	0	When you all said you were gonna hand Muhammad over to Tom Cruise. We promised Jesus that Muhammad would stay safely in the U-Haul!	[]
Other	13	0	I'm sorry, Kyle. I really thought my idea would work for you.	[]
Stan	21	1	If we were gonna have someone in a bear costume, why would we actually have it be Muhammad, you fucking idiot?!	['fucking']
Other	4	0	So where is he?!	[]
Other	9	0	Meanwhile, at the Hall of the Super Best Friends...	[]
Jesus	15	0	Buddha, will you lay off that stuff already?! It's gettin' to be a problem.	[]

Jesus	5	0	On the Super Best Screen!	[]
Other	15	0	Super Best Friends! You've got to help us! The Casa Bonita is under attack!	[]
Jesus	6	1	Great Scott! It's Barbra Streisand!	['streisand']
Other	10	1	I thought Barbra Streisand had been destroyed by Robert Smith.	['streisand']
Other	7	0	Yeah. Who would have activated her again?	[]
Jesus	5	0	I don't know, Seaman.	[]
Other	4	0	It's Sea-Man!	[]
Other	8	0	The Casa Bonita is gone! Jesus help us!	[]
Jesus	20	0	Jesus... That's where the boys took Muhammad. We have to stop her!  On the Super Best Friends power cycles!	[]
Other	69	0	There there, my little mouse friend. Soon you will have more asses than you ever dreamed of.  Ah, Kevin. You brought me my Fonseca. That's a good boy.  What's this? Someone is at the door, Kevin.  We tried to be left alone, Kevin. Who would disturb us at this hour? We must be careful.  Why, it's an African-American man, Kevin.  Yes? What do you want?	[]
Other	21	0	Yo man, sorry to bother you, but there's been an accident down the street, man. Can I use your telephone?	[]
Other	12	0	Oh I'm... terribly sorry, but I don't let strangers in.	[]
Other	40	2	Yo, I understand, man, but this accident is real bad, dawg. My lady's leg is all busted up and shit; she all crawlin' around on the road lookin' like a crippled crab, man. I just need an ambulance, dog!	['shit', 'crippled']
Other	17	0	There's a gas station about half a mile down the road. They have a phone there.	[]
Other	19	0	Okay, I see. I guess I understand. You just don't wanna let a black man in yo' house.	[]
Other	8	0	No, please, it isn't that at all.	[]
Other	38	1	No, I gets it man. Thought things had changed, dog. Thought when we got a black president, things would be different. We gots our black president, but Whitey still don't trust me to use his motherfuckin' phone.	['motherfuckin']
Other	20	0	No wait, I'm sorry, you're right you're right, we do have a black president. Please, come in.	[]

Other	10	0	How do you like that?! Celebrities can get violent too!	[]
Randy	11	1	Mr. Cruise, please call Barbra Streisand off!  She's destroying everything!	['streisand']
Other	10	0	We will call her off when you give us Muhammad!	[]
Randy	12	0	We don't have Muhammad. We aren't sure where he is.	[]
Other	13	0	That's your problem! Get him back or Babs will kill you all!	[]
Other	2	0	Oh boy!	[]
Stan	13	1	Kenny! Kenny! Dude, what the hell?! You're supposed to be watching Muhammad!	['hell']
Kenny	6	0	(I am. He's right here.)	[]
Stan	5	0	Oh thank God. Hey Muhammad.	[]
Kyle	20	0	Really sorry about all this, dude.  So what the heck are we gonna do now? Muhammad isn't safe here.	[]
Stan	18	1	The gingers and celebrities all want a piece of him. I don't know where we can go.	['gingers']
Kyle	14	0	Wait. No wait a minute! I've got it. I've totally got it!	[]
Kenny	1	0	(What?)	[]
Kyle	14	0	Remember the time when we got an elephant to make love to a pig?	[]
Stan	1	0	...Yeah.	[]
Kyle	21	1	I totally know how we can give the gingers and the celebrities what they want, but keep Muhammad safe. Come on!	['gingers']

Cartman	2	0	Them who?!	[]
Other	10	0	Eric, you have to understand, it's all very complicated.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Then start explaining it to me!	[]
Other	2	0	Very well.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Come on, Muhammad, the door is open.	[]
Stan	6	0	Dr. Mephesto, we need your help!	[]
Other	11	0	Oh for crying out loud, now everyone is letting themselves in!	[]
Kyle	21	2	Doctor, this is Muhammad. We want you to clone him, so we can give his copies to gingers, and Barbra Streisand.	['gingers', 'streisand']
Other	3	0	Oh, all right.	[]
Cartman	16	0	No nooo no no no! He's not doing anything except explaining who my father is!	[]
Stan	9	0	Dude, that doesn't matter to people right now!	[]
Cartman	5	0	It's all that matters!	[]
Kyle	20	1	Dude, nobody gives a crap about who your stupid father is! Muhammad is an important issue with actual ethical ramifications!	['crap']
Cartman	12	0	I guarantee you people care way more about who my father is!	[]
Other	27	0	In the small mountain town of South Park, the holy prophet of the Mormon religion is trying to fly up the nose of a deadly female singer.	[]
Other	6	0	Our powers aren't working, Swallow.	[]
Other	12	1	We can't attack Streisand's nose! It's just too big!	['streisand']
Jesus	8	0	We have to find another weak spot!  Moses!	[]
Other	1	0	What?	[]
Jesus	10	1	We need to know any weakness Barbra Streisand might have!	['streisand']
Other	18	1	Um... Let me think... Um... Oh I know... Barbra Streisand can't resist singing duets with Neil Diamond.	['streisand']
Jesus	36	0	All right. I'll build a stage. Lao Tse, use mind control to get a huge audience. Buddha and Smith, use powers to find a band. Seaman,  you and Swallow go get us sushi for dinner.	[]
Other	6	0	It's Sea-Man and Swallow.	[]
Jesus	6	0	Okay, Seaman, you guys head off!	[]
Other	3	0	Fine! Swallow, come.	[]
Other	9	0	Heh heh heheheh. No way he just said that.	[]
Stan	16	0	Alright alright, just tell Cartman who his dad is real quick so we can clone Muhammad.	[]
Other	12	0	It's a complicated story. I just can't tell him quickly.	[]
Kyle	11	0	Then we'll wait, because we have to clone Muhammad now!	[]
Other	11	0	Is Muhammad more important than a little boy's broken heart?	[]
Kyle	7	0	Oh, you are not doing that again!	[]
Other	15	0	Look, Mephesto, just tell this kid who his father is and you do it now!	[]
Kyle	6	0	Stop talking with your stupid hand!	[]
Cartman	5	1	Who you calling stupid, Jew?	['jew']
Stan	9	0	Come on, guys, we're running out of time!	[]
Other	1	0	Yes?	[]
Other	18	0	Hey, I'm sorry to bother you. There's uh, been an accident and I need a phone.	[]
Other	10	0	Yeah, right, let me guess: You're an African-American.	[]
Other	16	0	...Well, yes I am, but I don't know what that has to do with anything.	[]
Other	7	0	Beat it I'm not helpin' you!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Dude!	[]

Other	2	0	What?! Impossible!	[]
Other	6	0	They are sending a message now!	[]
Other	2	0	On screen!	[]
Other	6	0	We got Muhammad! We got Muhammad!	[]
Other	25	0	He's useless to you! You can't get Muhammad's power to not be made fun of without the Rob Reiner Goo Transfer Machine!	[]
Other	7	0	Why do you think we're calling?!	[]
Other	20	0	Our boss is willing to share Muhammad with you if you're willing to share the goo machine with us!	[]
Other	2	0	...Your ...boss?	[]
Other	14	1	What's going on? You got what you wanted, gingers, so let us go.	['gingers']
Other	10	1	Oh no no! The head ginger has plans for you!	['ginger']
Stan	7	1	What head ginger?! And where's Cartman?!	['ginger']
Other	11	1	Heheh, the head ginger has somethin' reeeally special planned for him.	['ginger']

Other	26	1	Form of... Neil Diamond.  If you all wouldn't mind, I'd like to invite a special friend to join me on stage. Miss Barbra Streisand!	['streisand']
Jesus	7	0	Let's hope to Christ this works.	[]
Other	58	0	Hello gorgeous. What do you say? Shall we sing together again like the old times?  Well that's because I love the girl.  And I still love you now. What have you got to say?  That might be true, but I still miss ya at night.  When you roll over, by my side, and you kiss me goodnight.	[]
Other	3	0	It worked, Jesus!	[]
Jesus	11	0	Yeah. And now to find Muhammad and take down Tom Cruise!	[]
Other	77	0	Do you remember when you had my parents killed and fed them to me as chili? I spent quite a while in a mental institution, Eric.  A lot of time for me to learn everything about you, so that one day I could take you down. I even learned the name of your father.  Oh, I know you're confused. Who wouldn't be?  You've been lied to by everyone!  Even by your own mother!  Hahahahahahahaha.	[]
Cartman	4	0	What do you know?!	[]
Other	23	0	I wanted to torment you with your father's identity. But what I found was more shocking than I could have possibly guessed!	[]
Other	5	1	Meanwhile, at the gingers' lair...	['gingers']

Other	5	0	Please, leave my boy alone!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Mom?	[]
Other	16	0	I got them all here for you, Eric! So listen while you got told the truth!	[]
Mr. Garrison	8	0	Please don't. We have to protect 'em.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Protect who??	[]
Other	7	0	Yes, protect... who? Tell him! Mr...  Jimbo!	[]
Other	4	0	Protect... the Denver Broncos.	[]
Other	1	0	Meanwhile...	[]
Other	8	0	This is incredible. Who wants to go next?	[]
Other	5	0	I want to be next.	[]
Other	4	1	No, gingers go next.	['gingers']
Other	8	1	Gingers can suck it! I'm next, ha!	['gingers']
Other	8	0	It's my goo machine! I'm next!	[]
Jesus	13	0	Nobody is going next!  Muhammad is our super best friend! Let him go!	[]
Other	9	0	They can't stop all of us! Get 'em!	[]
Jesus	1	0	Kyaaaaa!	[]
Other	31	1	The Denver Broncos.  There was a right tackle, see? Who had an illegitimate child with your slut of a mom, and everyone here covered it up! To protect the Bronco name!	['slut']
Mr. Garrison	13	0	They were having a really good year! There couldn't be any distractions!	[]
Cartman	6	0	My dad was a Denver Bronco?	[]
Other	33	0	Would you like to meet him? Well, you can't. Ever. 'Cause you see, Eric, we have something in common. Did I ever tell you that my father... played for the Denver Broncos?	[]
Cartman	2	0	No- nooo.	[]
Other	25	1	The only Bronco who lived in South Park. He got a little bored one week and had an affair with a slut named Liane Cartman!	['slut']
Other	2	0	No please!	[]
Other	20	0	Tell him! You almost did before but you got shot by your brother who was a Bronco fan! Tell him!	[]
Other	8	0	It's true... Jack Tenorman was your father.	[]
Other	14	0	You killed your own father and then you fed him to your half... brother!	[]
Cartman	2	0	No! Noooo!	[]

Other	6	0	I'll get you, Tom Cruise!	[]
Stan	9	0	Hey look! Tom Cruise has Seaman on his back.	[]
Other	4	0	What did you say?!	[]
Kyle	10	0	Oh yeah. Tom Cruise does have Seaman on his back.	[]
Jesus	7	0	I guess maybe Tom Cruise likes Seaman.	[]
Other	22	1	Whoawhoa whoa whoa!  You're not supposed to be able to make fun of me anymore! What the hell's going on?!	['hell']
Other	7	0	I'll be back, Super Best Friends!	[]
Jesus	6	1	Who's the creepy ginger kid?	['ginger']
Other	14	0	Reiner, you said the goo machine would work! But I got made fun of!	[]
Kyle	75	0	That's because there is no goo, Mr. Cruise. You see, I learned something today. Throughout this whole ordeal, we've all wanted to show things that we weren't allowed to show. But it wasn't because of some magic goo. It was because of the magical power of threatening people with violence. That's obviously the only true power. If there's anything we've all learned, it's that terrorizing people works.	[]
Jesus	31	1	That's right. Don't you see, gingers?  If you don't want to be made fun of anymore, all you need are guns and bombs to get people to stop.	['gingers']
Other	31	0	That's right, friends. All you need to do is instill fear and be willing to hurt people and you can get whatever you want. The only true power is violence.	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Other	12	0	Alright, people, let's start rebuilding our town! For the 39th time.	[]
Stan	5	0	Oh dude, look.  Hey, Cartman...	[]
Kyle	13	0	Look man, w-we know what you learned was pretty tough to hear.	[]
Cartman	18	0	Tough to hear? My dad was Scott Tenorman's dad. Don't you guys realize what that means?	[]
Stan	8	0	Yeah dude, we, we know what it means.	[]
Cartman	5	1	My dad was a ginger!	['ginger']
Kyle	2	0	Wwait, what?	[]
Cartman	17	1	I mean, obviously I take after my mom, but I have the ginger gene inside of me!	['ginger']
Kyle	12	0	Dude, you killed your own dad, and you're worried about that?!	[]
Other	3	0	Hey Eric, Eric!	[]
Cartman	1	0	What?	[]
Other	4	0	Come on, cheer up.	[]
Cartman	6	1	Cheer up? I'm half ginger!	['ginger']
Other	16	0	Yeah, but you're forgetting, you're also half Denver Bronco. That makes you pretty cool.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Hey, you're right. That does make me pretty cool.	[]
Kyle	5	0	You gotta be kidding me!	[]
Other	24	1	Shut up Kyle, you dumb Jew.  You've got Bronco blood in you, kid. That makes you awesome. Me? I should be movin' on.	['jew']
Cartman	7	0	Really Mitch? Ya, you've gotta go?	[]
Other	24	0	There's a bounty on my head and I can't afford to stay in one place for too long. So long... Denver Bronco.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Take it easy, Conner.	[]
Stan	19	0	Look, Mr. Cruise, I'm sorry I said you were a fudge packer and that seaman on your back.	[]
Other	27	0	I... I just can't do it anymore. I wanna go away. But there's nowhere on earth that people aren't around to rip on me.	[]
Kyle	26	0	Hey... Hey, we know a place! We know a place where everything is just happiness and joy. And no humans are there to mess it up.	[]
Stan	7	0	We do? Oh Oh yeah, we do!	[]
Other	24	0	You... really? Somewhere where I can just ...live out my days in peace and quiet and- Oh.  Oh please, can you show me where?	[]
Stan	12	0	We'll do better than that. We'll help you get there.	[]
