Other	146	3	Aaah.  Dickens. The imagery of cobblestone streets, cragging London buildings, and nutmeg-filled Yorkshire puddings.  Hello, I'm a British person. For years now, the character Pip has been featured prominently in the American show, South Park. However, many Americans don't realize where Pip came from. He's the prowling little adorable Englishman from Charles Dickens' timeless classic, Great Expectations  And so tonight, the makers of South Park have agreed to take a break from their regular show, and instead present the prestigious Dickens tale in its entirety from beginning to end. Indeed, after watching this show, you'll know the timeless classic as if you'd... read the Cliff Notes themselves. Our story is set in England, in the small town of Drop-A-Chair-Upon-Top-Snot,  where a young blond-haired boy named Pip was on his way to see his parents.	['dickens', 'dickens', 'dickens']

O, we have such fun together.  But it's getting dark, Mom and Dad. I'll see you again soon.  Wa-a-ah!	[]
Other	8	0	Wha' are you doin' 'ere, you little whippersham!	[]
Other	27	0	Oh, hello. Why, you look like an escaped convict. Did we breaky-wakys out of prison?  Oh dear! But you're shackled. Here, let me help you.	[]
Other	6	0	Wha' are you doin' wit' those?	[]
Other	17	0	I'm an apprentice blacksmith.  There you are.  And here's a sandwich. You must be starving!	[]
Other	9	0	Here. W-why are you easy to help me?	[]
Other	25	0	Well, it's not for me to judge you, sir. We are all the same.  Don't quite all smell the same, I'm afraid.	[]
Other	5	0	Pip, where 'ave you been?!	[]
Other	6	0	Waaah!  Lovely day, isn't it?	[]
Other	14	1	What the hell's lovely about it?!  Joe, teach this boy some bloody cynicism!	['hell']
Other	25	0	I don't know about that. I just thought I'd keep to me blacksmithing.  Ey, look! I've made me a metal fire poker.	[]
Other	28	0	A lot of bloody good a fire poker's gonna do while I'm starvin' to death! Why don't you make us some bloody food to eat!	[]
Other	9	0	Alright. Look 'ere, I made me a metal orange.	[]
Other	36	1	STOP your metal orange, you bastard! You never want a tablespoon of nigh'ingale droppin's, you me'al-poundin' fairy!  And you! Why don't you ge' a job?! You're eight years old now!	['bastard']
Other	11	0	Oh, lookie heeah!  I've gone and made a metal newspaper!	[]
Other	15	0	Shut up, you silly lip! What are we supposed to do with a metal newspaper?	[]
Other	28	0	Well, for starters we can look in the want ads and see if we can find Pip a job. Ohhh, lookie here! Young man wanted for paid position!	[]
Other	1	0	Where?	[]
Other	1	0	Where?	[]
Other	18	0	Havisham residence seeks young boy to play with lonely daughter. Will pay up to... TWENTY QUID A DAY??	[]
Other	7	0	That's a lot of  money-loney.	[]
Other	24	0	You can keep a little girl company for 20 quid a day, Pip. And Old Mrs. Havisham is the wealthiest woman in the town.	[]
Other	30	0	Well, the very next day, Pip went to Old Ms. Havisham's house to inquire about the job.  and it was there that he met the girl of his dreams.	[]
Other	3	0	Who are you?!	[]
Other	8	0	...I've come to answer the want ad.	[]
Other	7	1	Is that so, you smelly little bastard?!	['bastard']
Other	1	0	What??	[]
Other	28	2	This way, you pathetic squirt of vaginal discharge!  This way, you beef-witted shriveled-up monkey's penis.  Up here, you gamy mass of baby vomit!  In here.	['vaginal', 'penis']
Other	4	0	Eho. After you, miss.	[]
Other	14	0	I'm not going in there, you stupid puddle of a homeless man urine!	[]
Other	3	0	Who is that?	[]
Other	10	0	I've come to answer the want ad, ma'am.	[]
Other	24	0	Come closer. Look at me.  Does it frighten you to look upon a woman who has not seen the sun in over 20 years?	[]
Other	26	0	Oh, no, no! You you sort of look upon one when you have not seen the sun for over 20 years quite a lot these... days.	[]
Other	20	0	I sometimes have sick fancies.  And I have a fancy I should like to see someone play. So, play. Play.	[]
Other	1	0	Um.	[]
Other	5	0	Estella, play with this boy.	[]
Other	8	0	With HIM?  But he's just a commoner!	[]
Other	6	0	But, you can break his heart.	[]
Other	5	0	...Alright, boy, let us play.	[]
Other	8	0	Righty-o. What are we going to play?	[]
Other	20	0	We're going to play a little game called, Smack the Blond Boy In the Head With a Large Log.	[]
Other	18	0	Oh, yes! My sister and I play that game at home all the time!  Who will go first?	[]
Other	5	0	Oh, you stupid pathetic boy!	[]
Other	6	0	What do you think of her?	[]
Other	8	0	Well, uh... I think she's very pretty.	[]
Other	5	0	Hm-m-m. What else?	[]
Other	6	0	I think she's rather insulting.	[]
Other	18	0	Hm, you quite fancy her, don't you? Come back again next week. We shall play some more.	[]
Other	19	0	That night, Pip spent all his sleeping hours unable to get Estella's beautiful face out of his mind.	[]
Other	9	1	Stop dreaming about me, you slow-witted rectal belch!	['rectal']
Other	24	0	Day after day Pip visited Estella. Sometimes they would play, sometimes they would talk. But every single day Pip's love for Estella grew.	[]
Other	6	0	Don't you wanna play anymore?	[]
Other	8	0	Boy, do you still think I'm pretty?	[]
Other	4	0	Oho. Well, yes, miss.	[]
Other	8	0	And, do you still think I'm insulting?	[]
Other	8	0	Oh, um, not so much as before.  Ow!	[]
Other	12	0	I hate you! You're an oozing, painful hemorrhoid that belches pus!	[]
Other	2	0	Oh, dear.	[]
Other	15	0	You may kiss me if you like.  Come. Let us walk in the daisy garden.	[]
Other	35	0	Oh, what fun it is to splash about in the fountain!  You there, the prowling little boy! I bet you can't jump on my back!  Go on, then. Try and jump on my back!	[]
Other	3	0	Who is that?	[]
Other	18	0	Just another playmate hired to amuse me. You didn't think you were the only one, did you?	[]
Other	6	0	Oh I... rather thought I was.	[]
Other	14	0	Oh, you silly small-testicled boy. Come, let us walk through the rose garden.	[]
Other	12	0	Yes, good. She will break his pathetic heart into a million pieces.	[]
Other	88	0	Well, what a spot poor Pip was in. He was hired to be the friend of the very harsh and beautiful Estella. And although she treated him like dirt, or perhaps because she treated him like dirt, Pip found himself more in love with the little girl each and every day.  Oh, bless him! Isn't he lovely??  But, isn't it sad? Because Pip knew that someone as sophisticated and as wealthy as Estella could never love him, for he was just a simple blacksmith's apprentice.	[]
Other	23	0	And so you bang on this side, and bang on that side, and there you have it.  Your very own metal fuzzy dice.	[]
Other	5	0	Yes. I see.  Hoh, lovely.	[]
Other	6	0	Eeyyyy, what's all this, Pip?	[]
Other	7	0	Joe, do you know anything about girls?	[]
Other	9	1	Sure! They're those things with vaginas in them.	['vaginas']
Other	11	0	But, do you know anything about them? About how they work.	[]
Other	15	0	Oh, I don't know about that. I just like to keep to me blacksmithin'.	[]
Other	19	0	Do you think that a girl who is rich and educated would ever want to be with a blacksmith?	[]
Other	14	0	Oh. D'ooooh. No, I don't think so, Pip.  Who could that be?	[]
Other	3	0	Joe, the blacksmith?	[]
Other	2	0	The same.	[]
Other	14	0	I'm a lawyer from London in search of a young lad named Pip.	[]
Other	4	0	I'm Pip, sir.	[]
Other	20	0	Mr. Blacksmith, I've been sent here to offer you a reasonable sum of money in exchange for your apprentice.	[]
Other	9	0	Oh, well, uh Pip's not for sale, sir.	[]
Other	20	0	I have a client who wishes to give this bright child a future. Anything he desires.  Do you still object?	[]
Other	13	0	Heaven forbid I should stand in the way of Pip's future, but-	[]
Other	27	0	He will one day inherit a handsome property. But the owner of that property wants him first to travel to London and learn to be a gentleman.	[]
Other	4	0	That's great news!	[]
Other	12	0	There's only one condition, Pip. Your benefactor wishes to remain anonymous.	[]
Other	7	0	Oho. But it must be Ms. Havisham!	[]
Other	23	0	OH OH! If you have any suspicion of who that person might be, you are to keep it in your own breast. Understood?	[]
Other	2	0	Yes sir.	[]
Other	20	0	Then you will go to London in a week's time.  Here's 20 sterling. Well, blacksmith, you look stunned.	[]
Other	3	0	I am, sir.	[]
Other	19	0	Then I should take my leave.  Good evening, gentlemen, and we shall see you in London next week, Pip.	[]
Other	3	0	Good-bye, sir.	[]
Other	7	0	Pip!  A young gentleman! Of great expectations!	[]
Other	34	0	You shall stay here with your roommate, Mr. Pocket. He is a distinguished young lad who will help you on your way to being a gentleman. I trust you see no problem with this?	[]
Other	2	0	None, sir.	[]
Other	14	0	I should think not.  On up, then, and prepare for school on the morrow.	[]
Other	5	0	Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.	[]
Other	2	0	Mr. Pip?	[]
Other	2	0	Mr. Pocket?	[]
Other	3	0	Pray, come in!	[]
Other	8	0	Thank you kindly. You do look rather familiar	[]
Other	47	0	As do you. Perhaps we've seen each other before. As to our lodging, it's not by any means splendid. This is our sitting room - just chairs and tables and carpet and so forth.  This is my little room - rather musty, and this is your bedroom.	[]
Other	3	0	My, how lovely.	[]
Other	48	3	Oh, what a gay time we shall have, and I do mean gay as in festive, not as in penetration of the bum. Oh, but dear me! I beg your pardon! You're holding your bags all this time! Pray, let me take them!  I'm quite ashamed!	['gay', 'gay', 'bum']
Other	22	0	Oh it's... quite alright.  Lord bless me! Why, you're the pale young man I saw at Ms. Havisham's house!	[]
Other	15	0	Why, yes of course! You're the prowling little boy! Boy, what a smashing coincidence!	[]
Other	10	0	Perhaps, but perhaps not. Ms. Havisham is very generous indeed.	[]
Other	19	0	That old biddy? Oh, I assure you, I have nothing to do with her anymore. She's absolutely mad!	[]
Other	5	0	Well, what do you mean?	[]
Other	37	0	Well, don't you know about Ms. Havisham's melancholy past? Dear me, it's quite a story, and should be discussed over dinner. Come!  Right, time for a smashing meal and the story of Ms. Havisham.	[]
Other	36	0	Pocket, may I ask you a favor? I am desperately trying to become a gentleman! For the love of a certain girl. So, will you please tell me if I do something wrong at the table?	[]
Other	52	0	You'll do fine, dear fellow, just fine. Now on to Ms. Havisham: She was raised by a wealthy father and grew up to be a somewhat of a spoiled brat.  And now I might mention, Pip, that in London it is not the custom to put the knife in the mouth.	[]
Other	6	0	Hoh, dear, I'm terribly sorry!	[]
Other	50	0	Not at all, I'm sure.  Anyway, Ms. Havisham grew up to be a lovely young lady, and soon a man came along, which gets me to the cruel part of the story, merely breaking off, Pip , to remark that a dinner napkin should never be placed into the tumbler.	[]
Other	2	0	Sorry! Sorry!	[]
Other	70	0	Not at all, I'm sure.  So this man pursued Ms. Havisham closely and professed to be devoted to her. She passionately loved him back. The marriage day was fixed, the wedding dress was bought, the wedding guests were all invited, and finally the day came. But not the groom.  And I break from the tale now only to mention that one should never pass gas at the dinner table!	[]
Other	3	0	Oh. Excuse me.	[]
Other	27	0	Not at all, I'm sure. So the groom never showed. He simply wrote a letter, a letter that Ms. Havisham received 20 minutes before the wedding.	[]
Other	14	0	At half nine, the time when she stopped all the clocks in the house.	[]
Other	50	0	But afterward she laid waste to the entire house, as you have seen it, and has never since looked upon the light of day. And the story ends, Pip, with me suggesting that one should never pull out the wee wee and check it for scabs whilst at the table.	[]
Other	3	0	Terribly sorry, Pocket.	[]
Other	6	0	Not at all, I'm sure!	[]
Other	83	0	And so Pip spent the next several months learning how to be a gentleman. He was schooled in several languages. He was taught fencing and marksmanship, and he was shown how to dance and eat box. And after it all, after WEEKS and weeks of intense schooling, Pip was finally a full-fledged gentleman. Proud of himself, Pip decided to pay Ms. Havisham a visit, to thank her for her generosity, and to see if he was indeed, now, good enough for Estella.	[]
Other	4	0	Good evening, Ms. Havisham.	[]
Other	13	0	Come closer, Pip.  My, you're quite the gentleman now, aren't you?	[]
Other	3	0	Thanks to you.	[]
Other	24	0	Perhaps. Estella's been off to school as well.  She's become quite the lady. Would you like to see a picture of her?	[]
Other	8	0	Oh, my! She is even prettier than before.	[]
Other	8	0	Ohoh, you love her, don't you, Pip?	[]
Other	12	0	I don't know. I mean, I think about her every day.	[]
Other	36	0	Do you know what love is, Pip? It is blind devotion, unquestioning self-humiliation, utter submission, trust and belief against yourself and against the whole world, giving up your whole heart and soul to snip it.	[]
Other	1	0	Righto.	[]
Other	16	0	Love her, Pip. I developed her into what she is so that she might... be loved.	[]
Other	7	0	Yes, but... where will I find her?	[]
Other	23	0	There's a dance at the Palace tomorrow night. Estella will be there. Go and seek her out. And love her. Love her!	[]
Other	14	0	Thank you, Ms. Havisham! For everything!  I'm the happiest boy in the land!	[]
Other	25	0	And if she warms to you, love her; she tears your heart into pieces. And as you get older it will tear deeper.  Lover her.	[]
Other	69	0	Yes. Our young Pip had come a long way. From the apprentice of a blacksmith to a fine young gentleman of great expectations. And now he was to finally see his beloved Estella again at a Grand Ball held by the King of England, Tony Blair. It was here that Pip would finally and formally ask Estella to be his girlfriend. And all would be right with the world.	[]
Other	2	0	Hello, Estella.	[]
Other	7	0	Pip.  My goodness, how you've changed!	[]
Other	8	0	Yes. I've become a gentleman. May I?	[]
Other	14	0	I suppose.  So how is it that you've learned to dress and dance?	[]
Other	9	0	Well, I was sent to be schooled in London.	[]
Other	10	0	Iiii see, and you no longer live with the blacksmith?	[]
Other	27	0	Oh. I see Joe once in a while. But I don't have much in common with him anymore, now that I'm a gentleman and all.	[]
Other	1	0	Naturally.	[]
Other	8	0	It is wonderful to see you again, Estella.	[]
Other	3	0	Is it? Why?	[]
Other	9	0	Because I believe I'm in love with you.	[]
Other	9	0	Pip, you must know that I have no heart.	[]
Other	4	0	I think you do.	[]
Other	38	0	Oh, I have a heart to be shot or stabbed in, no doubt, and if it cease to beat I should cease to be, but  you know what I mean. I have no softness there, no sympathy, sentiment.	[]
Other	17	0	I see past that, Estella. I see a little girl who wants to be warm and kind.	[]
Other	8	0	Hey, Estella, let's get out of here.	[]
Other	5	0	Alright, Steve. Just one moment.	[]
Other	4	0	Who...? Who is that?	[]
Other	10	0	That is Steve. He is seventeen and has a car.	[]
Other	8	0	I see, and you... fancy this Steve fellow?	[]
Other	6	0	I should. He's my boyfriend.	[]
Other	1	0	Boyfriend??	[]
Other	5	0	What's the matter, Pip?!	[]
Other	21	0	I don't understand! I did everything right! I stopped being a poor commoner! I even blew off my lovin' Joe!	[]
Other	25	0	It's... it's... the way it goes sometimes, Pip.  He's... seventeen and has a car. I'm... I'm... very  I'm  leaving.	[]
Other	14	0	Ms. Havisham! You have to talk to Estella! She's going out with a-	[]
Other	9	0	Well well well, if it isn't Mr. Pip.	[]
Other	4	0	Ms. Havisham! But um...	[]
Other	16	0	Don't they make a handsome couple, Pip?  Look at the way he holds her hand.	[]
Other	20	0	But I don't understand.  You sent me away to become a gentleman so that I could be with Estella.	[]
Other	18	0	Things aren't always as they seem, Pip.  Oh, what's the matter? Did she... break your heart?	[]
Other	25	0	...Well, I suppose that if you set out to break my heart, you did a very good job of it. Because it certainly does hurt.	[]
Other	15	1	Yes. Tell me about the pain.  Tell me about the crushing and the prickly things.	['prickly']
Other	18	0	It's... a-as if... sssomeone has a hold of my heart and isss  squeezing it very tightly.	[]
Other	8	0	Yes, and it is somewhat difficult to breathe.	[]
Other	17	0	Hey, wait a second. You mean that this whole thing was just a setup by your mom?	[]
Other	11	0	Is your heart broken as well? Tell me all about it.	[]
Other	9	0	But why do you make your daughter hurt people?	[]
Other	58	0	Wuh-hy? Well, that's simple. Because I need the tears of broken-hearted men to use in my Genesis device.  You see, my foolish child, I'm growing very old. But tonight I will fuse my soul into Estella's once and for all. And then I can go on breaking men's hearts for another generation.	[]
Other	3	1	What the hell??	['hell']
Other	7	0	Estella, prepare yourself for the Genesis platform.	[]
Other	21	0	Oh no, you don't! You're my girl! And I'm not lettin' you walk out on me!  What the?!	[]
Other	13	0	And as for you, Pip, my robot monkeys should take care of you!	[]
Other	4	0	Pip? Pip, old chap?	[]
Other	1	0	Joe?	[]
Other	9	0	That's right. You're safe and warm now.	[]
Other	26	0	Joe found you lying face down in the street, Mr. Pip, You were in such a state. You've been unconscious here for nearly three hours.	[]
Other	38	0	Ms. Havisham! She has all the men who have had their hearts broken by Estella trapped in her house!  Oh, why would she have wasted all that time sending me to school and making me into a gentleman?	[]
Other	13	0	Well, about that, Pip: There's another person who wants to see you.	[]
Other	5	0	Allo, Pip. You remember me?	[]
Other	12	1	I'll rip off your arms and shove 'em up your arse!	['arse']
Other	12	0	Why, you're the escaped convict I helped a long time ago.	[]
Other	27	0	Yes. After you helped me I moved to Wales and made somethin' o' myself. If it weren't for you, I'd have never become a millionaire.	[]
Other	22	0	'E's the one that sent you to London, Pip! 'E's the one who sent you off to be a gentleman!	[]
Other	3	0	You? But why?	[]
Other	26	0	Because back then you treated me like any other person. You're weren't a snob and you helped me as you would a rich man.	[]
Other	17	0	Oh, dear. All this time I thought it was Ms. Havisham. She totally let me believe it.	[]
Other	29	1	I tried to tell you, Pip. She's a vengeful, spiteful woman, who wanted nothing more than to see you hurt along with the rest of the male sex.	['sex']
Other	30	0	Well, I've certainly learned a lot. That being a gentleman doesn't mean learning to dance, or proper table manners. It means being a gentle man. Gentle to everyone.	[]
Other	3	0	Righto. Pip. Righto.	[]
Other	12	0	And now I suppose there's only one thing left to do.	[]
Other	4	0	What's that, Pip.	[]
Other	16	1	If Ms. Havisham is determined to do this to others, let's go KICK HER ARSE!	['arse']
Other	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Other	57	1	And now we come to the final act of the Dickens classic tale, in which the stage is set for an epic showdown. Ms. Havisham's robot monkeys prove a formidable foe, but Pip is not about to let Estella's soul be forever consumed by the Genesis device. And now the thrilling conclusion of Great Expectations!	['dickens']
Other	11	0	Are you ready, Estella? Are you ready to complete the cycle?	[]
Other	2	0	Yes, Mother.	[]
Other	7	1	Not so fast, you ugly ancient bitch.	['bitch']
Other	1	0	Pip?	[]
Other	7	0	Your manhating days are over, Ms. Havisham!	[]
Other	15	0	Quite the contrary, blacksmith. My revenge on the male race is only about to begin.	[]
Other	4	0	Dear God, Pip, look!	[]
Other	7	0	Estella, help me! I'm your boyfriend!	[]
Other	3	0	So am I.	[]
Other	2	0	And me.	[]
Other	15	0	We were all Estella's boyfriends at one time or another. Now we're doomed.	[]
Other	22	0	Yes. Cry away, males.  Once your tears have collected into the Genesis device, the fusion of Estella and me will be complete.	[]
Other	7	0	You won't get away with this!	[]
Other	7	0	Won't I?  Let the transformation begin.	[]
Other	5	0	Pip, she started the device!	[]
Other	15	0	Pocket! Get over there, and do whatever it takes to keep those blokes from crying!	[]
Other	2	0	Righto, Pip.	[]
Other	2	0	It begins.	[]
Other	11	0	Come, Estella! You can't want to be part of this.	[]
Other	7	0	It is... what I was raised for.	[]
Other	1	0	AAAAAAA!!!	[]
Other	21	0	Hello, gentlemen. Oh, whatever you do, please do not cry. Havisham's device fuels itself on your tears, I'm afraid.	[]
Other	21	0	How are we not to cry. Our hearts have been broken, our lives ruined, and now we are set to die!	[]
Other	23	0	Yes, but just think about... panda bears!  Oh, they're so cuddly and sweet, panda bears are.  What silly little noses they have!	[]
Other	9	0	Panda bears make me sad. They're almost extinct.	[]
Other	32	0	Oh, right, right, let's not think about panda bears, then. Let's think about ...swimming! Oh, what jolly fun swimming is, with a splishy-splash and a hold-your-breath dive.	[]
Other	1	0	...Yes...	[]
Other	8	0	Get out of that chair, you old cow!	[]
Other	13	0	Estella! Listen to me! You are a wonderful girl, with a kind heart.	[]
Other	8	0	I told you, Pip. I have no heart.	[]
Other	20	0	But you do! And I shall prove it to you once and for all!  Look at this adorable little bunny.	[]
Other	6	0	Oh my. 'E's very cute.	[]
Other	44	0	You see that? A heartless person wouldn't care at all about this bunny. They'd just as soon break its neck.  ...Oh. But look at this bunny.  There. You see that? You have too big a heart to kill two baby bunnies.  ...Right.	[]
Other	27	0	Oh what fun it is to collect stamps! Lick the backs, put them into books all neat and tidy with those smashing little pictures and bright colors.	[]
Other	8	0	My father died in a stamp-collecting accident.	[]
Other	13	0	Right, let's not talk about stamp-collecting, then. Let's talk about...	[]
Other	2	0	Ice-skating!	[]
Other	20	0	Oh what fun ice-skating is!  Who can catch me? Who can catch the ice-skating king? That's me.	[]
Other	8	0	Oy can't figh' 'em off no moh!	[]
Other	27	0	Nine. Nine baby bunnies. A person with a heart could never kill nine baby bunnies. So you do have too big a heart to-  Ten baby bunnies!	[]
Other	6	0	...There's too many of them!	[]
Other	6	0	Please, sirs, you must not cry!	[]
Other	11	0	We can't help it! You're bawlin' us to tears!	[]
Other	5	0	Philip, it's too late!!	[]
Other	4	0	Twenty-six baby bunnies	[]
Other	13	0	I don't want to. I don't see the point in this.	[]
Other	1	0	What?	[]
Other	10	0	I don't want to kill any more of them.	[]
Other	8	0	There! You see?! You do have a heart!	[]
Other	12	0	You think so? Let me see it  Maybe I can kill it.	[]
Other	21	0	No no, I'm sure of it. You have a heart! You've bought your own life! Come with me now!	[]
Other	2	0	Yessss!  Noooo!	[]
Other	4	0	Ooooo, top smart, Pip!	[]
Other	4	0	You did it, Pip!	[]
Other	17	0	Well, I guess Old Ms. Havisham won't be takin' any revenge on any more blokes, ey?	[]
Other	8	0	Yes. her poor miserable life is finally over.	[]
