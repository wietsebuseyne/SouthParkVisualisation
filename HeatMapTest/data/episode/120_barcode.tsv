Randy	3	0	It's beautiful!	[]
Other	12	0	Welcome to Wall-Mart. Welcome to Wall-Mart. ...Welcome to Wall-Mart.	[]
Other	6	0	Sharon, isn't that your father?	[]
Other	15	0	Yes. Wall-Mart is the leading employer of seniors. And they also employ the handicapped.	[]
Other	18	0	Hello, Mrs. M-marsh. Can I help g- Can I help you get a sh- shopping cart today?	[]
Other	7	0	Why yes, I'd love one, Jimmy.	[]
Chef	8	0	My God. Look at all these incredible bargains.	[]
Cartman	13	0	Dude, check it out! Time Cop on DVD. Three copies for eighteen bucks!	[]
Kyle	12	1	Why the hell would you want three copies of the same movie?	['hell']
Cartman	15	0	Because one copy is nine ninety-eight! But this way you save like twenty bucks!	[]
Kyle	7	0	You only need one copy, r-tard!	[]
Cartman	14	0	Okay, fine, dumbass, YOU go ahead and buy one copy for nine ninety-eight!	[]
Kyle	18	0	Okay, fine, I will!  H-wait a minute! I don't even want one copy of Time Cop!	[]
Cartman	7	1	Dude, you can't shop for crap.	['crap']
Other	6	0	I can't believe these bargains.	[]
Other	3	0	Fools. Ignorant fools.	[]
Randy	26	0	Just look at the Marsh family, huh? Brand-new television, new plastic dishware and cups, and enough bulk-buy ramen to last us a thousand winters.	[]
Stan	12	0	Dad, how come Wall-Mart is able to sell everything so cheap?	[]
Randy	17	0	It's simple economics, son. I don't understand it at all, but, God I love it.	[]
Other	10	0	Six ninety-nine, fifteen dollars, free for fifteen ninety-eight...	[]
Randy	2	0	Aaaah!  Yeaaah... </>	[]
Other	5	0	Randy, what are you doing?!	[]
Randy	18	0	Anu-nothing!  I'ma-I'ma-I'm just gonna head down to the Wall-Mart real quick.	[]
Other	4	0	It's almost midnight.	[]
Randy	23	0	Yeah, think about it. If I go there now, there won't be anybody else there.  I can all the bargains to myself!	[]
Other	12	0	Thanks for coming to Wall-Mart.  All are welcome. All are welcome!	[]
Cartman	28	0	Excuse me! Hello?! Can somebody tell my why we're going to Jim's Drugs to buy Voltar cards when Wall-Mart has them for three bucks cheaper?	[]
Kyle	20	0	Dude, I can't deal with Wall-Mart right now. My parents had me there for three hours last night.	[]
Other	9	0	Oh, sorry boys. I'm going out of business.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Why, Mr. Farkle?	[]
Other	38	0	I can't compete with Wall-Mart's low prices. Everyone is shopping there now, and... well, I can't make ends meet.  I've got to sell the store and try to find another line of work.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Cartman, stop it!	[]
Cartman	10	0	What? I just felt like playing a little violin, Kyle.	[]
Other	15	0	I appreciate your business, boys, but you'll have to try somewhere else in town.	[]
Kyle	4	0	See?! That sucks, dude!	[]
Cartman	6	0	What? That's called progress, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	19	0	Yeah, but what about all the people getting laid off from the grocery stores?  And what about all the-	[]
Cartman	15	0	... Whatever. I can go get another one at Wall-Mart. It was only five bucks.	[]
Stan	14	0	Come on, let's go to Main Street and support one of those stores.	[]
Kyle	3	1	What the hell?	['hell']
Stan	1	0	Butters?	[]
Kyle	7	1	Butters? What the hell are you doing?	['hell']
Butters	13	0	Wull ah I'm just playin' Monster. It's kinda spooky out here.	[]
Stan	14	0	Dude, we gotta show our parents what Wall-Mart is doing to our town.	[]
Stan	6	0	Dad?  Jesus Christ, Da-dad! Dad?!	[]
Randy	1	0	Staaaan?	[]
Stan	4	0	Dad, oh my God!	[]
Randy	1	0	Staan...	[]
Stan	7	0	What? D-dad, are are you dying?	[]
Randy	15	0	No, I'm just... really, really tired. I... was shopping at Wall-Mart all night.	[]
Stan	4	0	But you-your face!	[]
Randy	34	0	Checkout line... They had these... little stickers filled with glitter! They were only ninety nine cents for 15 of them. I couldn't resist! Do you want one?  Here. It's a little turtle.	[]
Other	6	0	Come in?  Oh hello, fine shoppers.	[]
Chef	19	0	Sir, we just had a big town meeting, and decided we don't want your Wall-Mart here anymore.	[]
Randy	27	0	We're sorry, but it seems our Main Street is dying and good people are losing their jobs. We'd all like you... out of South Park.	[]
Other	20	0	What? What, you think I want to be here? I hate this place. But it... won't let me leave.	[]
Kyle	6	0	But you run the Wall-Mart.	[]
Other	49	0	Oh, you're wrong!  Wall-Mart... isn't run by anybody! First it reels you in with its bargains. Next thing you know you, you're workingbe at the Wall-Mart because it has all the jobs. Then you're sitting in a little office, trapped on all sides.	[]
Chef	7	0	They why don't you just quit?!	[]
Other	7	0	Not so loud! It can hear you.	[]
Kyle	5	0	You hate Wall-Mart, too?	[]
Other	68	0	Aah!  I didn't say that! I love Wall-Mart! With all its... fantastic bargains and one-stop shopping, who can't love it, right?  Uh, Wa-Wall-Mart takes the hassle out of shopping and, and makes it both affordable and fun.  Ah-and Wall-Mart really gives back to the community! Us people are certainly happy to have a store like Wall-Mart, aren't we?	[]
Randy	10	0	Hey, wait a minute, I think we just got squirreled.	[]
Other	16	0	Yeah. That guy probably thinks he can get us to go away by being so goofy!	[]
Cartman	7	0	Ha! You owe me five bucks, Kyle!	[]
Other	19	0	Here we go, everyone. I got three nice steaks from South Park Grocery. We'll have to share them.	[]
Randy	17	0	Heh, I remember when we could afford to buy six steaks when we shopped at Wall-Mart.	[]
Stan	14	0	Yeah, but Dad, the whole town agreed not to shop at Wall-Mart anymore.	[]
Randy	6	0	I know, I know! God!  Bleeeh!	[]
Stan	10	1	Mom, Dad, when people die, do they always crap their-	['crap']
Other	4	1	Oh, you stupid turd!	['turd']
Randy	20	0	Oh Jesus, a broken glass! Well, I don't see any choice now! We have to go to Wall-Mart!	[]
Other	2	0	We do?	[]
Randy	24	0	Huh! Where else are we gonna get a new glass at this hour?! Everyone get your shoes on, we're goin' to Wall-Mart!	[]
Stan	9	0	But Dad, we're not supposed to shop at-	[]
Randy	12	0	Stan! One family buying one glass isn't gonna make a difference!	[]
Randy	19	0	Heeeey...  Gerald, what are you doing?! We said we weren't going to shop at the Wall-Mart anymore!	[]
Other	15	0	Well where else was I gonna get a napkin dispenser at nine thirty at night?	[]
Randy	24	1	Mr. Garrison! Chef! Jimbo!  Now, come on people! What the hell is wrong with you?! Don't you see what you're all doing?!	['hell']
Other	7	0	Well what are you doing here, Randy?	[]
Randy	12	0	I came because I wanted to make sure nobody was shopping here.	[]
Stan	1	0	Dad!	[]
Randy	22	0	Oh all right, em maybe I was gonna buy a glass. One glass! ... And some chips... And butter.  And some new pliers.	[]
Other	19	0	Jesus! Look at us! We all don't like the Wall-Mart, but we can't stop coming here.	[]
Other	7	0	It's like some mystical evil force.	[]
Randy	32	0	Yeah. This place has a power over us we can't resist! We have to find a way to put the South Park Wall-Mart out of business once and for all!	[]
Other	5	0	Let's burn it down!	[]
Chef	7	0	No, no, no! Let's freeze it!	[]
Other	11	0	I think it's best we try to reason with it.	[]
Kyle	31	0	No! All we have to do is not shop at Wall-Mart anymore! If you want it to go away, all it takes is a little self-control and personal responsibility.	[]
Randy	4	0	Kumbaya, my Lord, Kumbaya.	[]
Other	7	0	Kumbaya, my Lord, Kumbaya. Kumbaya, my Lord...	[]
Cartman	14	1	You butthole, Kyle. You just had to go and ruin everything, didn't you?	['butthole']
Kyle	11	0	It wasn't my idea to burn the Wall-Mart down.	[]
Cartman	20	0	No, but you got everyone all worked up! You're always jealous of the Wall-Mart. You always hated it.	[]
Kyle	12	0	Dude, our town is going to be better without the-  What the?	[]
Cartman	2	0	Oh, awesome!	[]
Kyle	12	0	How... How did this happen?  Mom, Dad? Why are you shopping here?	[]
Other	14	0	We can't destroy it, son. We have to learn to live with it.	[]
Randy	4	0	Can I help you?	[]
Stan	5	0	Dad, what are you doing?!	[]
Randy	15	0	You get a discount working here. Ten percent. That means the bargains are even better.	[]
Stan	5	0	Dad, you're a geologist!	[]
Randy	36	0	I'll make less money, sure, but... as long as I buy everything at Wall-Mart, it'll all even out. Don't you see? Wall-Mart isn't our enemy, it's our neighborhood friend.	[]
Kyle	13	1	Hey! Hey!  Who the hell told you to put this thing back up?!	['hell']
Other	9	0	Sorry kid, we've got orders from corporate headquarters.	[]
Kyle	7	0	But nobody wants a Wall-Mart here!	[]
Other	10	0	You're gonna have to talk to the higher-ups.	[]
Stan	3	0	Where are they?	[]
Other	15	0	Bentonville, Arkansas. That's where Wall-Mart started, that's where all the bigwigs are.	[]
Kyle	26	0	Looks like we're gonna have to go to Arkansas. Come on, guys. We're gonna put a stop to Wall-Mart once and for all!	[]
Cartman	25	0	Whoa, Pixie Sticks, twenty-nine ceeeents?  Wall-Mart? ...Are you speaking to me? ...My friends? ...Trying to hurt you again?  Yes, Wall-Mart. I understand.	[]
Stan	6	0	Three tickets to Bentonville, Arkansas, please.	[]
Cartman	12	0	Wait! Guys! Hold on! I wanna go with you and help out.	[]
Kyle	23	0	No way! You wanna go with us so you can betray us at some point and keep us from destroying the Wall-Mart.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Nuh-uh.	[]
Kyle	23	0	Yeah, huh! You wanna go with us so that later you go, Haha, I was working for Wall-Mart all along or something.	[]
Cartman	4	0	I am not, Kyle!	[]
Stan	11	0	Dude, just let him come. The bus is about to leave.	[]
Kyle	6	0	All right, fine. Come on, fatass!	[]
Cartman	16	0	Haha. You fools have no idea that I would never let you hurt the Wall-Mart.	[]
Kyle	3	0	I heard that!	[]
Cartman	3	0	You heard what?	[]
Kyle	15	0	You said we have no idea that you're never let us hurt Wall-Mart!	[]
Cartman	6	0	That's not what I said!	[]
Stan	3	0	Dude, come on!	[]
Kyle	12	0	He is working for the Wall-Mart to stop us from succeeding!	[]
Stan	5	0	Dude, we have to go!	[]
Kyle	2	1	God-damnit!	['damnit']
Stan	8	0	Well hurry up if you're coming, Cartman!	[]
Cartman	21	0	Hehe. You stupid fools have no idea  that I'm actually working for the Wall-Mart to stop you from succeeding!	[]
Stan	6	1	Goddamn, that took a long time.	['goddamn']
Kyle	12	0	It would've been faster if Cartman hadn't slashed the tires!	[]
Cartman	15	0	I did not! I wanna close Wall-Mart just as much as you guys do!	[]
Other	4	0	Can I help you?	[]
Kyle	16	0	Yeah. We've come to complain. We don't want a Wall-Mart in our town.	[]
Other	16	0	Who does? Nobody likes what the Wall-Mart does, but it keeps... right on doing it.	[]
Kyle	9	0	We want to talk to who's in charge.	[]
Other	22	0	In charge? I guess that would be Harvey Brown. He's the current president of Wall-Mart. One of the original creators.	[]
Stan	3	0	Where's he?	[]
Other	45	0	We... invented the Wall-Mart Super Center in 1987. The idea was simple: build a store for one-stop shopping where bulk purchases could keep prices incredibly low.  We didn't know what we were doing. In just four years, it was out of control.	[]
Kyle	6	0	So how do we stop it?	[]
Other	5	0	You don't stop it.	[]
Stan	6	0	There has to be a way!	[]
Other	26	0	There's nothing! Don't you understand?! Nothing can stop the Wall-Mart in your town! ...Unless... of course, you can find and destroy its heart.	[]
Kyle	5	0	The heart of Wall-Mart?	[]
Cartman	12	0	Sir, don't you think you're talking a little too much?	[]
Other	21	0	Every Wall-Mart has a heart, somewhere near the television department. Destroy the heart and you could reverse the entire process!	[]
Cartman	5	0	You speak too much, sir!	[]
Stan	9	0	Why don't you guys just destroy the heart?	[]
Other	34	0	Because the Wall-Mart stops you. Many have tried, kid. Union leaders, nature activists, even the best fair-trade lawyers tried to stop the Wall-Mart and now. They are Wall-Mart shoppers all.	[]
Kyle	12	0	All right. Come on you guys, we have to get back home.	[]
Other	37	0	It won't work, don't you understand?! It isn't gonna stop until there's nothing but Wall-Mart left! Jesus, what did we do?! What did we do?!  Boys!  Tell the world... I'm sorry!	[]
Stan	4	0	No, dude, don't!	[]
Cartman	9	1	That's ten bucks you owe me, dick-face!	['dick']
Kyle	40	0	All right, this is it! If Wall-Mart has a heart, we have to find it and destroy it! No matter what the Wall-Mart does to try to stop us, we have to be strong! Let's do it.	[]
Cartman	31	0	I'm afraid not, Kyle! Wall-Mart is a great store! I could not let you fools ruin its terrific bargains! You see, I was working for Wall-Mart all along!	[]
Kyle	4	0	I knew you were!	[]
Cartman	4	0	No, you didn't.	[]
Kyle	13	0	Yes, I did! I said from the beginning that you would do this!	[]
Cartman	4	0	No, you didn't.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Yes, I did!	[]
Cartman	4	0	No, you didn't.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Yes, I did!	[]
Cartman	4	0	No, you didn't.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Yes, I did!	[]
Cartman	4	0	No, you didn't.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Yes. I did!	[]
Cartman	10	0	...You see, Kyle, it was me who slashed the bu-	[]
Kyle	21	0	-slashed the bus tires in Arkansas! I said so! I told you the minute that I-  -and I told you that-	[]
Cartman	26	0	I can't hear you! Lalalalalala!  I'm sorry, boys. But if you want to hurt the Wall-Mart, you'll have to go through me!	[]
Kyle	13	0	We don't have time for this! Kenny, keep him away from us!	[]
Cartman	13	0	Very well, Kenny! Let us battle!  Ow, Kenny. K-Kenny! Knock it off.	[]
Other	4	0	Welcome to Wall-Mart.	[]
Stan	3	0	Save it, Grandpa!	[]
Kyle	7	0	We've gotta find the television department.	[]
Randy	8	0	Boys, these axes are only four ninety-nine.	[]
Stan	9	0	Dad, we know how to destroy the Wall-Mart.	[]
Randy	6	0	Shhhhh! What are you talking about?	[]
Stan	17	0	One of the creators told us. You have to take your keys over to the television department.	[]
Randy	12	0	Television department... All right, come on, let's go!  Oh my God!	[]
Stan	1	0	What?!	[]
Randy	25	0	Those two-dollar salt-and-pepper shakers! They were three dollars five minutes ago! The Wall-Mart is lowering its prices trying to stop us!	[]
Stan	13	0	Come on, we've got to try to make it to the back!	[]
Randy	10	0	Gaaah! Don't look! Don't look at its bargains!	[]
Kyle	10	0	I think I see the television department in the back!	[]
Stan	8	0	Is that the right way, Dad? Dad?!  Dad!	[]
Randy	8	0	The screwdriver set is only nine ninety-eight!	[]
Stan	3	0	Come on, Dad!	[]
Randy	15	0	I can't make it, boys! You're gonna have to go on without me!	[]
Stan	6	0	No, dad! We need your keys!	[]
Randy	42	0	This bargain is too great for me! I'm gonna have to buy these! Here! Take the keys and go on!  The television department is near the back! Next to the cell phones! Go! Hurry! I'm gonna go buy these screwdrivers!	[]
Stan	4	0	There! The television department!	[]
Other	7	0	Hello, boys. Congratulations on getting this far.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Who are you?	[]
Other	4	0	I am... Wall-Mart.	[]
Stan	1	0	You?	[]
Other	35	0	I've taken this form in order to talk to you. But I can take many forms.  Does this suit you better? Or perhaps you prefer this form?  I can take whichever form I like.	[]
Stan	14	0	We don't want your store in our town; we come to destroy you.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Where's the heart?	[]
Other	19	0	To find the heart of Wall-Mart, one must first ask oneself, Who is it that asked the question?	[]
Stan	6	0	Me. I'm asking the question.	[]
Other	6	0	Ah, yes, but who are you?	[]
Stan	7	0	Stan Marsh. Now, where's the heart?	[]
Other	9	0	Ah. You know the answer, but not the question!	[]
Kyle	7	0	The question is, Where is the heart?	[]
Other	18	0	Very well. You want to see the heart of Wall-Mart? It lies beyond that plasma-screen television.	[]
Stan	4	0	It's a mirror.	[]
Other	31	0	Yes, don't you see? That is the heart of Wall-Mart. You, the consumer. I take may forms: Wall-Mart, K-Mart, Target. But I am one single entity: Desire!	[]
Stan	10	0	Well, the guy in Arkansas said to destroy the heart.	[]
Other	22	0	Gaaah! No! No, what have you done?!  Now you shall see my true form!  Now you see me as I truly am!	[]
Kyle	7	0	We'd better get out of here.	[]
Chef	6	0	Get out! It's gonna blow!	[]
Stan	9	0	H-Dad, come on! We've gotta get out!	[]
Randy	11	0	Too late for me, son! I have to buy this stuff!	[]
Kyle	8	0	The Wall-Mart is imploding! Everybody out now!	[]
Other	9	0	Boys, you did it! You killed the Wall-Mart!	[]
Other	6	0	How did you do it, Kyle?	[]
Kyle	16	0	All Wall-Marts start a self-destruction sequence if you break a mirror in the back.	[]
Chef	14	0	We know how to destroy it now. Spread the word to all the towns!	[]
Randy	15	0	Wait. I think I understand the symbolism of the mirror. The Wall-Mart... is us.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Duh.	[]
Randy	31	0	You see boys, if we like our small-town charm more than the big corporate bullies, we all have to be willing to... pay a little bit more. Do you understand?	[]
Other	13	0	Yeah! Let's all go shop at Jim's Drugs down the street!	[]
Other	3	0	...Oh Lord, Kumbaya.	[]
Randy	9	0	All right, let's not make that mistake again.	[]
Other	8	0	Yeah, lets all shop over at True Value!	[]
Other	4	0	Let's go! Yeah!	[]
