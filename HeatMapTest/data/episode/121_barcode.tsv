Other	18	0	Thanks so much for coming to visit Butters in the hospital, boys. It means a lot to him.	[]
Other	5	0	What happened to him, Doctor?	[]
Other	82	1	From the test results, it would appear your child was tortured by a bully. He received a massive snuggie, his underwear pulled up so high it nearly killed him. He also received two Indian sunburns on his forearms, a charlie horse on the thigh, and a second-degree titty twister. And from the damage to his head area, it appears he was also given a swirly, a colossal one.  It also looks like he received a noogie, and, a Polish bike ride.	['titty']
Other	3	0	What's that?	[]
Other	12	0	We aren't sure. We only know that... there is no cure.	[]
Other	22	0	If only we had let him in!  Why didn't we let him inside the house when he was screaming for help??	[]
Other	7	0	Now, honey, we were trying to read.	[]
Cartman	20	0	We've got to tell them who did this, you guys. We're gonna get it as bad as Butters!	[]
Kyle	23	0	That's nothing compared to what my mom will do to me if she finds out I've been lying for five years!	[]
Cartman	14	1	Maybe you didn't hear so good in there, Kyle! Second-degree titty-twister!	['titty']
Stan	22	0	Calm down guys, we don't have to go tell our parents. We just need to go out and get some protection.	[]
Cartman	13	2	How the hell are condoms gonna help us?!  Sorry, heh. Never mind, hehe.	['hell', 'condoms']
Stan	16	0	I'm talking about hiring somebody bigger than Trent to protect us from him. Come on!	[]
Other	12	0	I'm gonna jump the wall of fire.  Yeah, that was sweet!	[]
Other	2	0	Hey, look!	[]
Kyle	6	0	Dude, we shouldn't be here!	[]
Stan	16	0	Stay cool, guys. If anybody can protect us from Trent Boyett, it's the sixth graders.	[]
Other	12	0	Stupid little Fourthies!  What are you little Fourthies doin' in our hangout?!	[]
Stan	8	0	We've come to... ask you for help.	[]
Other	1	0	Help?!	[]
Kyle	9	0	We need you to protect us... from a bully.	[]
Other	8	0	Yeah? And what do we get for it?	[]
Cartman	43	0	A twelve-pack of Dr. Pepper, A Shoots & Ladders game used only three times, DVD of Harry Potter 2, and a coupon for a free side of fries with a purchase of any deluxe hamburger at Red Robin.  All this can be yours.	[]
Other	10	0	You're gonna have to do better than that, Fourthies!	[]
Kyle	6	0	Well...  Well, what do you want?	[]

Other	9	1	Yeah! I totally wanna suck your mom's tits.	['tits']
Stan	2	0	Dude, weak!	[]
Other	9	0	Come back with a naked picture of your mom!	[]
Stan	1	0	No!	[]
Other	6	0	Then we aren't helpin' you!	[]
Kyle	5	0	Wait! We'll do it.	[]
Other	12	0	It'd have to be a good picture, too!  So long, Fourthies!	[]
Cartman	16	0	Okay, so now we just need to get a picture of Stan's mom naked. Cool.	[]
Other	26	0	That's the preschool teacher, Ms. Claridge. Poor woman suffered such horrible burns she can only communicate by... beeping once for yes and twice for no.	[]
Other	9	0	Oh hello, Ms. Claridge. Nice day, isn't it?	[]
Other	11	0	Need help across the street, Ms. Claridge?  Well all right then.	[]
Other	51	0	Ms. Claridge, you all right?  You can talk to me, Ms. Claridge. I understand: one beep for yes and two for no. Don't you think you should get out of the street?  Look you, you don't have to be so cold. I'm just trying to help.  Oooo, sorry!	[]

Stan	21	0	You see, Mom, all the kids at school were told to bring a picture of their moms' breasts for anatomy class.	[]
Cartman	18	0	I don't know, son. That sounds awfully strange.  You cannot have a picture of my hot breasts.	[]
Stan	5	0	But mom, my teacher will-	[]
Cartman	9	0	Nononono, you gotta go  But Mo-o-o-om.	[]
Stan	4	0	But Mo-o-o-	[]
Cartman	5	0	But Mo-o-o-om.	[]
Stan	3	0	This is hopeless!	[]
Kyle	20	0	Why don't you just sneak in your mom's closet and get a picture when she's changing clothes?	[]
Stan	15	1	That's sick, dude! I'm not taking a picture of my mom's boobs!	['boobs']
Kenny	4	0	(I'll do it.)	[]
Stan	22	1	No, you're not doing it either! We just need to find something that looks like boobs to take a picture of.	['boobs']
Kyle	7	0	What else has big round squishy globes?	[]
Cartman	15	1	Draw the um- You guys draw the nipples like on the bottom of my asscheecks.	['asscheecks']
Kyle	9	0	No, the nipples are more in the middle, see?	[]
Cartman	17	0	Yeah, but Stan's mom is old; that means her nipples... sag more to the bottom now.	[]
Stan	4	0	How do you know?!	[]
Cartman	9	0	Will you guys trust me? I know this stuff!	[]
Stan	3	0	All right, fine.	[]

Other	7	0	Yeah. Sure does. Uh-huh! Uh-huh!	[]
Other	7	0	Oh yeah, those are so hot.  Oooohhh	[]
Kyle	12	0	Okay, so now you'll help us take care of Trent Boyett?	[]
Other	21	0	Oh all right, we'll let this Trent Boyett know that if he messes with you, he's messin' with us!	[]
Cartman	2	0	All right!	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Woohoo!)	[]
Cartman	13	0	You guys, we're free! We haven't a care in the world!	[]
Kenny	2	0	(All right!)	[]
Other	11	0	I need three minutes alone with the picture behind the bushes.	[]

Stan	9	0	Hey, look. What is Ms. Claridge doing?  Ms. Claridge?	[]

Other	5	0	Over there!  Another wet willie?	[]
Other	3	0	Worst one yet.	[]
Other	6	0	It's all slimy and spitty!	[]
Other	6	0	Give the poor kid some morphine.	[]
Stan	3	0	Dude, what happened?	[]
Other	15	0	We... told him not to mess with you guys... We told him... you paid us.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Oh, Jesus. You told him that?!	[]
Other	16	0	Boys, you have to let him rest. Some mean kid gave him a Texas Chili Bowl.	[]
Stan	3	0	What's that?	[]
Other	40	0	It involves Tabasco sauce, a telephone, and the anus.  I don't know what kind of kid would do this to other people; I only know that I wouldn't ever want to be on that kid's bad side.	[]
Stan	12	0	We're dead. Trent knows we sent the sixth-graders after him.	[]
Cartman	9	0	He's gonna give us all Texas chili bowls.	[]
Kyle	17	0	We've gotta move away. We've gotta get as far away from this town as possible!	[]
Stan	9	0	No, no, we've just gotta find better help.	[]
Kyle	17	0	From who? We can't ask adults for help and there's nobody tougher than sixth graders.	[]
Stan	4	0	There is... one person.	[]
Stan	1	0	Shelly?	[]
Other	7	1	Shut up, turd! I'm watching television!	['turd']
Stan	12	0	Shelly, you're my sister, right? And families... depend on each other.	[]
Other	12	0	I said shut up, or I will destroy you, tur-r-rd!	[]
Stan	29	0	Shelly  Somebody is going to kill me, and I can't go to Mom or Dad for help, so, you're kind of the only person I have... left.	[]
Other	9	1	Stop crying, turd! Now, who's gonna kill you?	['turd']
Stan	23	0	Trent Boyett. He just got released from Juvenile Hall. He was sent there for burning Ms. Claridge, but actually, it was our fault.	[]
Other	6	0	Oh, you are such stupid turds.	[]
Stan	36	0	We were only four years old at the time, uh. We du-we didn't think about the past coming back to haunt us then. We didn't think and now he's gonna kill us!	[]

Stan	5	0	Admit it was our fault?	[]
Other	21	1	You can't run from your past, turds. Apologize and make amends. Then I'll protect you from this Trent turd.	['turd']
Other	11	0	Ms. Claridge, the people in town are really worried about you.	[]
Other	18	0	Look, if you're having some kind of problem, you have to be able to talk to people.	[]
Other	18	0	Just tell us this: do you trust that we want what's best for you, yes or no?	[]
Other	16	1	All right, fine! But someday you're gonna have to learn to let people in!  Bitch.	['bitch']
Stan	11	0	Hi, Ms. Claridge. Uh, we have s-something to tell you.	[]
Kyle	16	0	The thing is, Ms. Claridge, we did a lot of stupid things when we were kids.	[]
Cartman	8	0	A lot of stupid things that we regret.	[]
Kenny	9	0	(And it's time for us to come clean.)	[]

Cartman	13	2	I am not going to have a titty twister! I hate titty twisters!	['titty', 'titty']
Other	10	0	You don't even know how to use that!  Wow!	[]
Other	13	0	So, Trent, you just had to finish off your old preschool teacher, eh?	[]
Other	4	0	No! They did it!	[]
Cartman	6	0	Trent Boyett is a liar, sir.	[]
Other	14	0	Ms. Claridge, did Trent Boyett do this to you.  Yes, yes. Take him away!	[]
Other	7	0	No! You've gotta listen to me!	[]
