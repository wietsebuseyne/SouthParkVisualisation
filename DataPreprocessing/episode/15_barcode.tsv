Announcer 1	17	0	Who is Eric Cartman's father? At the end of this episode, you will know the answer.	[]
Mephesto	12	0	And now, to continue, the father is indeed someone in this room.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Man, this feels like the longest minute of my life.	[]
Stan	3	0	Oooh- hey, Kenny.	[]
Mephesto	4	0	Gentlemen, the father is...	[]
Mr. Garrison	7	1	Hey, what the hell's going on?	['hell']
Jimbo	5	0	It's a power outage!	[]

Officer Barbrady	4	0	Oh my God, look!	[]
Kenny	6	0	(Oh my God, they killed Mephesto!)	[]
Kyle	2	1	You bastards!	['bastards']
Mr. Garrison	4	0	Mephesto's been shot.	[]
Chef	3	0	Is he ...dead?	[]
Jimbo	17	0	Hey! This window is shot out, too! That means the killer was not someone in this room!	[]
Mr. Garrison	4	0	Then who was it?	[]
Announcer 1	16	0	Who shot Mephesto? Was it the school counselor? Or was it Ms. Crabtree? Or was it--	[]
Cartman	13	0	Ey! Wait a minute! I didn't find out who my father was!	[]
Announcer 1	5	0	Or was it Sheila Broflovski?	[]
Chef	9	0	Waait!  He's still breathin'! He's not dead.	[]
Cartman	5	1	Goddammit! Who's my father?	['goddammit']
Chef	9	0	We've got to get him to the hospital.	[]
Cartman	7	0	You've got to be kidding me!	[]
Chef	3	0	Come on, children!	[]

Gerald Broflovski	14	1	Oh, that poor kid. It must be hell for him going through all this.	['hell']
Jimbo	20	0	There's a murderer free in South Park. We have to find out who it is before they kill again.	[]
Mr. Garrison	9	0	Yeah. God only knows who they'll kill next.	[]
Announcer 1	13	0	Who will they kill next? Will it be Jimbo? Barbrady? The Denver Broncos?	[]
Cartman	4	0	Is he awake yet?	[]
Kyle	7	0	He's bleeding pretty bad back here.	[]
Chef	12	0	Don't let him bleed on my Meredith Baxter-Birney memorial towel.	[]
Kyle	8	0	What's a Meredith Baxter-Birney memorial towel?	[]
Chef	27	0	I actually was with Meredith Baxter-Birney in this very car. And afterwards we used that towel to...  Wait a minute. Why am I telling you this?	[]
Stan	9	0	Could you pull over so I can get out?	[]
Chef	8	0	What? We have to get to the hospital.	[]
Stan	17	0	I have to get out first. I'm not gonna make it; I can't stand hospitals.	[]
Chef	16	0	Sorry, Stan. We just gotta drop Mephesto off and then we can get outta there, alright?	[]
Kyle	15	0	Man, it's really starting to snow.  I hope they don't close the roads.	[]
Cartman	7	0	They can't. Mephesto can't die.	[]
Kyle	13	0	Maybe it's better you don't know who your father is, Cartman.	[]
Cartman	42	0	No way, dude! I can't stand to leave things unfinished. It's like when you hear the first part of that song, Come Sail Away, by Styx. If I hear the first part of that song, I have to finish it.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Really?	[]
Cartman	11	0	Yeah, du-I can't do anything until it's done.	[]
Kyle	4	0	I'm sailing away	[]
Cartman	3	0	No! Don't!	[]
Kyle	8	0	Set an open course for the virgin sea...	[]
Cartman	140	0	Eh--  For I've got to be free Free to face the life that's ahead of me On board I'm the captain, so climb aboard We'll search for tomorrow, on every shore And I'll try, oh lord, I'll try to carry on Maymaynemay Maymaynemay Maymaynemay Maymaynemay A gathering of angels appeared above my head They sang to us this song of hope And this is what they said Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me I thought that they were angels, but to my surprise We climbed about their starship and headed for the skies Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads	[]
Kyle	2	0	Whoa, dude!	[]
Jimbo	12	0	What are we gonna do, Mayor? This killer is on the loose!	[]
Sheila	14	0	We can't even leave our homes for fear of our children's safety.	[]
Sharon	5	0	Uh... Where are our children?	[]
Mayor	22	0	Officer Barbrady, let's pretend for one second that we had a competent law enforcer in this town: what would he do?	[]
Officer Barbrady	15	0	Hmmm... That's a good question, Mayor. Let me get right on that with thinking.	[]
Greenfield	2	0	Mayor! Mayor!	[]
Mayor	4	0	The press is here.	[]
Greenfield	17	0	My name is Sid Greenfield. I'm the director from Los Angeles for America's Most Wanted.	[]
Mayor	7	0	Youuu certainly made it up here quickly.	[]
Greenfield	12	0	We're desperate for stories.  A-and this one is so compelling.	[]
Mayor	1	0	Really??	[]
Greenfield	15	0	Sure. This story has everything. People. Furniture. Talking-ih it's a real American story.	[]
Officer Barbrady	11	0	Hey, I thought of something.  Uh... no, wait, that's subtraction.	[]
Mayor	10	0	Mr. Director person, what exactly do you want to do?	[]
Jimbo	6	0	Mayor, shouldn't we be focusi--	[]
Mayor	1	0	Shh.	[]
Greenfield	48	0	We just want to do a recreation of the story for our show. Then we'll flash a number on the screen that people can call if they have any information regarding the identity or location of the shooter. That's it. You win, we win, America wins.	[]
Mayor	12	0	Are you sure this wouldn't make our little town look dangerous?	[]
Greenfield	16	0	Don't worry, Mayor. America's Most Wanted is not about violence, it's about family.	[]
Cameraman	2	0	It is?	[]
Mayor	9	0	Weelll, in that case, I guess it's okay!	[]
Greenfield	14	0	Great! We'll get started with auditions immediately. What part should we cast first?	[]
Announcer 1	14	0	Who will the director cast first? Will it be Mr. Garrison? Officer Barbrady? Chef?	[]
Liane	6	0	I want to have... an abortion.	[]
Receptionist	16	0	Uoh well, we can do that. This must be a very difficult time for you, Mrs...	[]
Liane	23	0	Cartman. Yesuh- it's such a hard decision, but I just don't feel I can raise a child in this screwy world.	[]
Receptionist	27	0	Yes, Ms. Cartman. If you don't feel fit to raise a child, then abortion probably is the answer. Do you know the actual time of conception?	[]
Liane	4	0	About eight years ago.	[]
Receptionist	6	0	...I sseee, so the fetus is...	[]
Liane	3	0	Eight years old.	[]
Receptionist	14	0	Ms. Cartman, uh- eight years old is a little late to be considering abortion.	[]
Liane	1	0	Really?	[]
Receptionist	12	0	Yes, this is what we would refer to as the fortieth trimester.	[]
Liane	11	0	But I just don't think I'm a fit mother.	[]
Receptionist	23	0	Wuh... But we prefer to abort babies a little- ...earlier on; in fact, there's a law against abortions after the second trimester.	[]
Liane	13	0	Well, I think you need to keep your laws off of my body.	[]
Receptionist	27	0	Hmmmmm. Tsk, I'm afraid I can't help you, Ms. Cartman. If you want to change the law, you'll have to speak with your congressman.	[]
Liane	11	0	Well, that's exactly what I intend to do. Good day!	[]
Chef	9	0	Come on, children! We've gotta find a doctor!	[]
Stan	7	0	Ugh. I can't do it, dude.	[]
Kyle	9	0	Come on, Stan. Hospitals aren't all that bad.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Yeah, stop being a wuss!	[]
Chef	1	0	Doctor!	[]
Dr. Doctor	13	0	One moment, please. Nurse, I need 20 cc's of sodium pentathol, stat!	[]
Kyle	8	0	Whoa, dude! She doesn't have any arms!	[]
Dr. Doctor	8	0	We're an equal-opportunity employer here, son.	[]
Chef	8	0	Doctor! We've got a shot cracker outside!	[]
Dr. Doctor	16	0	I'll be right with you, right after I inject this man with a long needle.	[]
Stan	7	0	Oh man.  I'm gonna be sick.	[]
Dr. Doctor	12	0	There there, young man. Medical science is nothing to be afraid of.	[]
Stan	1	0	Oogh.	[]
Nurse	8	0	Ooooo, I think you're hitting the bone.	[]
Stan	1	0	Ooooogh.	[]
Dr. Doctor	15	1	Yes. I can hear the needle scraping against the bone inside.  Oops, he's hemorrhaging.	['scraping']
Stan	1	0	Aghh!	[]
Dr. Doctor	5	0	Ooo! His head fell off.	[]
Stan	6	0	I'm gotta get outta here!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Stan!	[]
Dr. Doctor	8	0	Ugh, some people just have a weak stomach.	[]
Mephesto Tryout	14	0	And the father of Eric Cartman is... Bang! Oh, Jiminy! I've been shot!	[]
Greenfield	32	0	Oh, thank you very much. We'll get back to you.  I think I've seen enough genetic engineers. Let's move on to the auditions for the part of Misteruhh Garrison.	[]
Assistant	5	0	Call the Mr. Garrison auditions!	[]
Garrison 1	13	0	Boy, I sure hope I'm not Eric Cartman's father, Mr. Hat.	[]
Mr. Hat 1	7	0	You can say that again, Mr. Garrison!	[]
Greenfield	12	0	Alright, not bad. Let's keep him on the top pile. Next!	[]
Mr. Garrison	13	0	I sure hope that I'm not Eric Cartman's father, Mr. Hat.	[]
Mr. Hat	7	0	You can say that again, Mr. Garrison!	[]
Greenfield	3	0	Thank you! Next!	[]
Mr. Garrison	1	0	What?	[]
Greenfield	1	0	Next!	[]
Garrison 2	13	0	I sure hope that I'm not Eric Cartman's father, Mr. Hat.	[]
Mr. Hat 2	7	0	You can say that again, Mr. Garrison.	[]
Greenfield	11	0	Perfect! You got it! Let's move on to the Chefs!	[]
Liane	17	0	...And so you see, Congressman O'Reilly, that's why I think abortion laws should be changed.	[]
O'Reilly	19	0	Well, all I know is that third-trimester abortions are illegal. I don't really know anything about 40th.	[]
Liane	19	0	But the person at Unplanned Parenthood said you were who I had to talk to about changing the law.	[]
O'Reilly	13	0	No- No, I think youah gotta talk to the governor about that stuff.	[]
Liane	2	0	Oh, dear.	[]
Dr. Doctor	10	0	Well, this is about all I can do for him.	[]
Cartman	15	0	Can't you get him to talk? I have to know who my father is.	[]
Dr. Doctor	7	0	Sorry, son, it might be a while.	[]
Cartman	7	1	Wake up, you son of a bitch!	['bitch']
Chef	1	0	Whoa!	[]
Dr. Doctor	24	0	Now, son, that's not's gonna do him any good. I'll let you know if there's a change in his condition.	[]
Cartman	11	0	I can't wait anymore. What am I supposed to do?	[]
Kyle	2	0	Hey, Cartman.	[]
Cartman	1	0	What?	[]
Kyle	4	0	I'm sailing ay...	[]
Cartman	35	0	--way; Set an open course for the virgin sea For I've got to be free, free to face the life that's ahead of me On board I'm the captain, so climb aboard...	[]
Stan	8	0	Okay okay, let's get outta here now!	[]
Kyle	11	0	I don't know if that's gonna be too easy.	[]
Dr. Doctor	9	1	My God, that's a hell of a storm.	['hell']
Stan	2	0	Oh, weak.	[]
Cartman	20	0	...Some happy, some sad; I think of childhood friends and the dreams we had We lived happily forever, so the--	[]
Greenfield	29	0	God, I hate mountains.  This better not push back our shooting schedule.  Okay, people, let's rehearse the reenactment from the top before we shoot it.  Who's that?	[]
Assistant	22	0	Oh, that's TV's Eric Roberts. We were able to ge him to play the part of the little monkey guy.	[]
Greenfield	17	0	Whoa. Talk about all washed-up, huh? Great to have you, Eric!  Here we go, aaand action.	[]
Mephesto Actor	8	0	I want to announce who the father is.	[]
Greenfield	1	0	Bang!!	[]
Mephesto Actor	5	0	Oh, I've been shot!	[]
Barbrady Actor	7	0	Nobody move! I'm a law officer!	[]
Chef Actor	10	0	My God, I think he's gone into cardiac arrest!	[]
Mephesto Actor	1	0	Whoaw..!	[]
Barbrady Actor	7	0	You seem somewhat unnerved by this, Chef.	[]
Chef Actor	18	0	Are you accusing me, Barbrady? Because if you are accusing me, don't hide behind your clever riddles!	[]
Barbrady Actor	22	0	Our differences must be set aside for now, Mr. Chef. I'm simply a man, a man trying to do my job.	[]
Barbrady	6	0	Whoa, this is a good movie!	[]
Cartman	24	0	Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me-hee	[]
Stan	9	0	Ohh. Dude, when can we get out of here?	[]
Blonde	5	0	Doctor, I can't focus!	[]
Dr. Doctor	32	0	We're doing the best we can, ma'am. They've closed the pass and none of the other doctors can get through. For now, it's just me, and Nurse Goodly.	[]
Chef	8	0	Wait a second. They've closed the pass??	[]
Dr. Doctor	25	1	Yes, I'm afraid we're critically understaffed. Unless we get help soon, all these people in here are completely fucked.  Metaphorically speaking, that is.	['fucked']
Cartman	9	0	What about Mephesto? Are you taking care of him?	[]
Dr. Doctor	35	0	He's on full life-support and breathing fine. He shouldn't need any help - so long as the power doesn't go out.  Oof. Who didn't see that coming a mile away, huh?	[]
Voice-over	27	0	Tonight, on America's Most Wanted, a shooter is on the loose in Colorado, and its residents are up in arms! Here's your hose, John Walsh.	[]
John Walsh	49	0	Good evening and welcome to America's Most Wanted. Tonight: terror invaded the small mountain community of South Park, Colorado, when Dr. Alphonse Mephesto  was gunned down in his laboratory. America's Most Wanted has reconstructued this heinous crime  in hopes that your calls could help solve the case.	[]
Mephesto Actor	4	0	I've been shot!	[]
Garrison Actor	7	0	My God, Mr. Hat! Get some help!	[]
Mr. Hat Actor (!)	4	0	Right away, Mr. Garrison.	[]
Eric Roberts (as Kevin!)	23	0	No, no! My lifetime partner and friend, gone, taken away in the wink of an eye. O, Fortune, why do you mock me?	[]
Greenfield	10	0	What the--? Bu-eh. Eric Roberts is improvising lines again!	[]
Chef Actor	14	0	I'm going to get the man to a hospital. Who will help me?	[]
Eric Roberts	14	0	This is not a world I want to live in! Doesn't anyone want--	[]
Greenfield	7	2	God-dammit!  What the hell is this?!	['dammit', 'hell']
Cameraman	8	0	We've lost the feed to L.A.	[]
John Walsh	29	0	Uuuhm... We-we seem to have lost our linkup to the South Park crew, sso I guess we'll be going to our featured movie, Who Framed Roger Rabbit.	[]
Announcer 1	10	0	Who framed Roger Rabbit? Was it Jimbo? Mr. Garrison? Chef?	[]
Greenfield	8	0	Somebody go see why we lost the hookup!	[]
Jimbo	7	0	Holy smokes, that blizzard is getting crazy!	[]
Nurse Goodly	17	0	Don't panic, anybody. The power lines are down, but the backup generator is running just fine.	[]
Dr. Doctor	8	0	Nurse, I could use some help in here!	[]
Goodly	1	0	Coming!	[]
Cartman	7	0	Lady-m? Is Mephesto gonna be okay?	[]
Goodly	26	0	Yes, for now. But I'm afraid the generator won't run for long. The batteries run out in half an hour. Time is very short.	[]
Dr. Doctor	12	0	Nurse, please! I need another pair of hands in here!  Oh, sorry.	[]
Liane	18	0	Don't you see, Governor? I should have a right to have an abortion if I want one.	[]
Governor	15	0	Mmaarr. I don't know-uh, I might need some more convincing, hm-hm-hm.	[]
Liane	33	1	I mean, what right do I have bringing another child into this overpopulated world? Then again, I should've thought of that before having sex. then againuh-- Oh, I just don't know...	['sex']
Dr. Doctor	18	0	Please, Mr. Chef. I've over 100 people to attend to an-and only myself and Nurse Goodly.	[]
Chef	7	0	What do you want me to do?	[]
Dr. Doctor	6	0	Do you know anything about surgery?	[]
Chef	5	0	I used to watch Quincy.	[]
Dr. Doctor	30	1	What?! Why the hell didn't you say so? Put on some scrubs! Boys, I'm making you all honorary doctors. You can help us save these people's lives.	['hell']
Stan	3	0	No way, dude!	[]
Jimbo	10	0	Well,  we're not going anywhere for a loong time.	[]
Greenfield	4	0	We're snowed in?	[]
Mayor	4	0	Yes. We're trapped!	[]
Garrison	5	0	Like sailors on a submarine.	[]
Mayor	11	0	My God, this is the worst storm I've ever seen.	[]
Assistant	14	0	Oh I have to get out of here, I haven't eaten since breakfast.	[]
Barbrady	6	0	Yeah, I'm gettin' hungry, too.	[]
Jimbo	23	0	I hope you all realize what we might be facing here.  Our only option might be to... eat each other to stay alive.	[]
Greenfield	17	0	Uuuhh, it's only been like, four hours. Aren't you resorting to cannibalism a little quickly?	[]
Jimbo	30	0	That's a lot of lead, Mr. Director. I don't eat pretty, but if a few of us must die so the rest can stay alive, so be it.	[]
Mayor	6	0	Buut, how do we decide who?	[]
Jimbo	4	0	Well, we draw straws.	[]
Greenfield	21	0	Now, wait a minute. We all had a big breakfast: can't you people go without eating for a little while?	[]
Jimbo	16	0	Calm down, soldier! We need every person here to keep his head! Barbrady, fetch some straws.	[]
Greenfield	9	1	Well- who the hell made you the boss anyway?	['hell']
Announcer 1	12	1	Who the hell made Jimbo boss? Was it Barbrady? Chef? Mr. Gar--	['hell']
Dr. Doctor	49	0	Miles' appendix has burst. I have no choice but to operate now with our limited power. I need you all to be strong for me.  Nurse Goodly will take care of the anesthesia. Chef, you act as her arms.  Boys, you have to help with suction and bandages. Ready?	[]
Stan	1	0	No.	[]
Dr. Doctor	13	0	Okay. First, I'll make an incision on the chest, over the heart.	[]
Stan	3	0	Oh boy.  Bleech!	[]
Kyle	6	0	Duhuhude! You barfed into the incision!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Sweet.	[]
Dr. Doctor	1	0	Suction!	[]
Cartman	7	0	Hey, who's screwing with the lights?	[]
Announcer 1	16	0	Who is screwing with the lights? Is it Barbrady? Or Jimbo? Or the 1991 Denver Broncos?	[]
Cartman	8	0	That is really starting to piss me off.	[]
Jimbo	15	0	Alright. So far, everybody has a long piece of straw. We'll keep drawing.  Whew.	[]
Garrison	1	0	Whew.	[]
Barbrady	1	0	Wooo!	[]
Jimbo	10	1	Wait a minute! Where the hell is the short one?	['hell']
Barbrady	3	0	The short what?	[]
Jimbo	22	1	Dammit, Barbrady! When you draw straws, you're supposed to have one of them short! That's how you decide who loses!	['dammit']
Barbrady	7	0	That's not how I played it!	[]
Garrison	10	0	Uuugh, could we hurry this up? My stomach is growling.	[]
Dr. Doctor	35	0	I found a map that shows the location of a backup generator. Apparently, they built a large self-sustaining generator- for just this kind of emergency. But it's out and away from the hospital.	[]
Chef	7	0	So how do we get to it?	[]
Dr. Doctor	172	0	We must split up into two teams: Team A, and Team B. Team A will consist of myself, Stan, Kyle, Eric, Chef, and Nurse Goodly. Team B will consist of Kenny.  Now, listen closely, Team B. Your goal will be to turn on the backup generator. To do this you must brave the storm outside and get into this sewage duct.  Meanwhile, Team A will go to the holding area, here  where there is a television, and some cocoa. We will drink the cocoa and watch family programming until Team B makes it through the sewage duct. By that time, Team B- remember, that's you, Kenny- should reach the outer core of the generator. It will be a cold and dangerous climb to the top, and there could be velociraptors- here.  Once you reach the top, you should be able to get a clear view from this windows of us drinking cocoa and watching television. Then, you could proceed down into the generator, and power it on. Are there any questions?	[]
Cartman	7	0	Nnoh, that sounds pretty sweet to me.	[]
Dr. Doctor	8	0	Great, then, let's do it. Go, Team!	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Huh?)	[]
Garrison	8	0	I... can't... go on... eh. So... hungry...	[]
Mayor	10	0	We're all going to die in this horrible place.	[]
Jimbo	16	0	We have to have the energy to make it through the night. We have to eat.	[]
Greenfield	9	0	How can we? How could we live with ourselves?	[]
Jimbo	8	0	There's only one answer: eat Eric Roberts.	[]
Mayor	10	1	Yes, of course. Nobody gives a shit about Eric Roberts.	['shit']
Garrison	3	0	Eat Eric Roberts!	[]
Eric Roberts	3	0	No! No, please!	[]
Mayor	13	0	Well, there's no going back now.  We're cannibals.  God save us.	[]
Jimbo	7	0	God wants you to live, Mayor. Fight!	[]
Assistant	13	0	Well I have to admit, Eric Roberts was much juicier than I expected.	[]
Greenfield	1	0	Aaww.	[]
Garrison	15	0	This snow just isn't letting up. We're gonna die here, I know it.	[]
Jimbo	5	0	What time is it, Barbrady?	[]
Barbrady	4	0	It's almost midnight.	[]
Garrison	6	0	Oh! I can't... go on.	[]
Jimbo	15	0	We'll give the storm another hour. After that, we might have to eat again.	[]
Greenfield	8	0	What? Christ, are you people diabetic or something?	[]
Dr. Doctor	6	0	Team B? Come in, Team B.	[]
Kenny	4	0	(This is Team B.)	[]
Dr. Doctor	31	0	Listen, Team B. We've found another path to the generator. There's actually a nice heated walkway to it, so you don't need to walk through all that sewage.	[]
Kenny	13	2	(Are you fuckin' telling me that I could've fuckin' gone that way?!)	['fuckin', 'fuckin']
Dr. Doctor	30	0	Oh... Well, forget I said that, then. Listen, Team B, you should be seeing a large drift of snow with some metal sticking out of it just to your left.	[]
Kenny	7	0	(Yup! I see it in the drift.)	[]
Dr. Doctor	7	0	Good. Head towards it. Team A out.	[]
Cartman	15	0	What if Mephesto never wakes up, and I never find out who my father is?	[]
Mayor	20	0	My God, what a harrowing tale of human drama this is. All of us doing what we must to survive.	[]
Jimbo	22	0	It is amazing what people can do under stress. Just look at the pyramids. Nobody knows how they built those, or who.	[]
Announcer 1	11	0	Who built the pyramids? Was it the Babylonians? Officer Barbrady? Samaritans?	[]
Kenny	6	0	(Okay, I've reached the generator)	[]
Dr. Doctor	18	0	Roger, Team B.  He's reached the backup generator.  Team B, can you see the two copper nodes?	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Roger.)	[]
Dr. Doctor	8	0	Good. Now, is there a wire connecting them?	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Negative.)	[]
Dr. Doctor	20	1	Damn! The wire connecting the nodes is gone! We need to complete the circuit between them, or we're screwed.	['damn']
Kyle	6	0	D'you have any wire here?	[]
Dr. Doctor	19	0	There's no time! Once these lights flicker out all the patients on life-support are going to die!	[]
Kenny	5	0	(I'll stick 'em together)	[]
Dr. Doctor	22	0	No, Kenny, you can't. There must be some other way! He's going to make the connection himself, with his hands.	[]
Kyle	4	0	No, he'll die!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Go, Kenny!	[]
Dr. Doctor	2	0	Kenny! Nnnoooooo!	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Goodbbyyyyee-ugh!)	[]
Stan	7	0	Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!	[]
Kyle	2	1	You bastard!	['bastard']
Chef	2	0	The power!	[]
Dr. Doctor	12	0	Quickly! Get the scanner running again!  We've got a chance now!	[]
Clinton	12	0	Well, okay, Mrs. Cartman, I'll legalize 40th trimester abortions for you.	[]
Liane	5	0	Oh, thank you, thank you.	[]
Clinton	7	0	We'll have the pregnancy terminated immediately.	[]
Liane	1	0	Terminated?	[]
Clinton	8	0	Why yes, that's what an abortion is.	[]
Liane	22	0	Oh no uh- I didn't mean that. I meant the other thing you can do-what's that other A word?	[]
Clinton	1	0	Adoption?	[]
Liane	7	0	Yess, that's what I mean. Adoption.	[]
Clinton	5	0	Well, that's- pretty different.	[]
Liane	15	0	Oh, I should tell my son the truth about everything myself. Good day, Mr. President.	[]
Dr. Doctor	19	0	Well, we made it. The power is on, the snow is melting, and your friend Mephesto is doing fine.	[]
Mephesto	4	0	Where... where am I?	[]
Chef	21	0	You're at the hospital, Mr. Mephesto. You were shot. Now, we don't know who tried to shoot you, but--	[]
Mephesto	16	0	Ohh. I'm sure it was my brother again. He tries to shoot me every month.	[]
Chef	1	0	Ooohhh.	[]
Dr. Doctor	14	1	Where's the little fat boy? He'll be delighted that Mephesto's awake.	['fat']
Chef	7	0	He went off looking for Mr. Kenny.	[]
Stan	10	0	He was a good friend, and I'll miss him.	[]
Kyle	13	0	He was very brave. He risked his life so that Mephesto could live.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Yeah. And now he's a freezy-pop.	[]
Stan	14	0	Dude! D'you think if we hit him with a shovel, he'd shatter?	[]
Kyle	8	0	I don't know. Let's find out.	[]
Garrison	7	0	Ohh. It's over! We're free!	[]
Barbrady	10	0	Yes, but at what cost, Mr. Garrison? At what cost?	[]
Jimbo	10	0	Listen, everybody. We did what we had to in there.	[]
Mayor	8	0	But- hhhow will we live with ourselves now?	[]
Ned	13	0	Mm-one day at a time, Mayor. Mm-one day at a time.	[]
Singer	2	0	Ave Maria...	[]
Garrison	17	0	Well, I'm bringing home some Eric Roberts in a doggie bag. Does anybody else want some?	[]
Mephesto	31	0	I'm glad that you could all come. I can finally reveal who the father of Eric Cartman is. But first, I want to thank Kenny McCormick for sacrificing his life--	[]
Cartman	4	0	Just tell us already!	[]
Mephesto	26	0	Alright alright. The father of Eric Cartman is... Say, did anybody see that Terrance and Phillip special last month? Wasn't that just the funniest thing--	[]
Cartman	8	1	Dammit! Tell me who my father is already!	['dammit']
Mephesto	17	0	Oh. As I said before, the father is somebody in this room. The father is... Mrs. Cartman.	[]
Chef	1	0	What???	[]
Liane	4	0	Yes, it's true.	[]
Garrison	6	0	Noo, that doesn't make sense!	[]
Mephesto	19	0	Yes. It took quite a while for me to understand as well. You see, Mrs. Cartman is a hermaphrodite.	[]
Garrison	3	0	Uh-meaning what?	[]
Mephesto	9	0	Meaning that she has both male and female genitals.	[]
Liane	3	0	It's true.	[]
Chef	18	0	You mean, at the Drunken Barn Dance, when we all got together with her, she was a he?!	[]
Mephesto	47	1	No no, not exactly. But she did have a penis.  The fact of the matter is, hermaphrodites cannot bear children, so Mrs. Cartman's DNA match with Eric can only mean that she is his father, and she got another woman pregnant at the Drunken Barn Dance.	['penis']
Cartman	6	1	Ugh. Man, this is fuckin' weak.	['fuckin']
Stan	12	0	Dude! You're a big fatass, and your mom's a hermapholite!	[]
Liane	20	0	I'm sorry I never told you, Eric.  I just thought, maybe it would be a little shocking to you.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Oh, wow, gee whiz, you think so, Mom?!	[]
Mephesto	9	0	Well, that's that. Thank you all for playing.	[]
Cartman	16	0	No no, wait a minute! If... if she's my dad, then... who's my mom?!	[]
Announcer 1	14	0	Who is Eric Cartman's mother? Is it Mrs. Crabtree? Sheila Broflovski? The Mayor?	[]
Cartman	3	0	Ooohhh, forget it!	[]
