Publisher 1	22	0	No. I'm a big book publisher who's not the least bit interested in your stony memoirs. You're a towel.	[]
Towelie	56	0	Now what am I gonna do? I gotta pay rent and I just wasted three weeks writin' my memoirs. It's time for me to stop bein' so irresponsible. I've gotta shape up, focus, an' come up with real solutions to my problems.  I'd better get a little high.  Oh, maybe I shouldn't.	[]
Joint	14	0	But you have to think of somethin' fast, an' gettin' high makes you smart.	[]

Publisher 2	32	0	Right, I'm sorry.  Well Steveen, if it's all right with you, I'm gonna to get our agents and lawyers on the phone right now. We're in business, sir.	[]
Towelie	2	0	All right!	[]
Oprah	71	0	Thank you so much.  Once in a while I come across a book that is sooo honest and sooo moving that it changes my life.  A Million Little Fibers is the true story about a man who was born in a laboratory. Please welcome author Stevem McTowelie!  Steven, when I read your book, I thought to myself, How can a human being go through all this and still turn out okay?	[]
Towelie	11	0	Well, I guess I'm just an extra-special tow-  person.	[]
Oprah	41	0	You talk in your book how you would sometimes have to spend days hung up on a rack. What would that do to you emotionally? You have been through... so much,  and I think that people all over America could benefit...	[]
Her crotch	24	0	Oh God, there she goes again, babblin' about people's lives and carryin' on. She hasn't paid any attention to me in years!	[]
Oprah	10	0	...a life that kept getting up whenever it was down...	[]
Her crotch	39	0	Nobody knows what it's like to be Oprah's minge. All she does is work, never gives her ol' minge a nice rub now and again. A minge needs attention! At least a scratch once in a while!	[]
Oprah	21	0	Well Steven, your book hasn't sold a lot of copies yet, but I have some pretty exciting news for you!	[]
Mingie	49	0	Used to be a time when Oprah would play with me night and day. She'd pet me for hours usin' every finger. Now I just sit here, in the dark, not even so much as a pinky! I should write a book! Be much more depressin' than his!	[]
Oprah	15	0	And so, Steven, I'm making your book my official Book of the Month selection!	[]
Towelie	9	0	Really?  Wow. I'm gonna get super-rich now.	[]
Oprah	41	0	Uh huh, okay. Well listen, maybe we can get her in as a guest on the 19th. All right, is John Travolta available to be a guest the week after that? Okay, that might work better since it's Sweeps Week.	[]
Mingie	35	0	Can't take it anymore. All she ever does is work work work, never pays attention to the ol' minge. I'm always trapped in these stuffy pantsuits. I want attention! I'm bloody bored!	[]
A voice	11	0	Oh stop your complainin'! I'm tryin' to sleep back here.	[]
Mingie	8	0	Ay, 'oo's that? Is that you, Gary?	[]
Gary	21	0	Yes it's me. You think you've go' it bad? Oprah hasn't paid any attention to me in years.	[]
Mingie	17	1	Oh, what do you care? You're just an asshole. I'm a minge! Minges need stimulation.	['asshole']
Gary	48	2	Assholes need stimulation too, you bastard! I want to travel. I want to see Paris. I thought lamp was goin' to get better, but Oprah's always busy. Werkin' and werkin', diyatin' and not diyatin'. I need a pukin' up mounds of chocolate cake or teaspoons of weedgrass.	['assholes', 'bastard']
Mingie	26	0	She's a workaholic. Let's face it: the only way we're ever goin' tuh get any attention is if Oprah doesn't work anymore.	[]
Gary	5	0	Well that'll never happen.	[]
Mingie	5	0	Not unless she gets fired.	[]
Gary	6	0	Fired... You got a plan, Mingie?	[]
Mingie	21	0	That bloke on the show today, the one Oprah supported. 'E isn't a bloke at all. 'E's a towel.	[]
Gary	5	0	Ooo. How d'you know?	[]
Mingie	37	0	I'm a minge. Minges know a towel when they hear one. If evidence gets out that Oprah's champion author is a towel, she'll look right foolish. Fans'll start droppin' off by the millions.	[]
Gary	5	0	'Ow do we get proof?	[]
Mingie	15	0	We get somebody else to do it. The greatest investiga'ive reporter of our time.	[]

Geraldo	11	0	A towel? A talking towel? That doethn't make any thenthe.	[]
Mingie	11	0	Tell 'im 'e'd be surprised at things that can talk.	[]
Gary	9	0	You'd be surprised at things that can talk.	[]
Geraldo	8	0	What proof do you have of this accusation?!	[]
Gary	16	0	Just look into the author of A Million Little Fiyabers, and you'll discover the truth.	[]

Towelie	1	0	Why?	[]
Oprah	33	0	We need to tell the audience why you changed some of the facts in your book; that you thought it necessary to heighten certain things to make the book more relevant to people.	[]
Towelie	2	0	Hey yeah.	[]
Oprah	26	0	Just come on the show and explain in a very level-headed way that changing some facts shouldn't matter if the book helps people, okay?	[]
Towelie	8	0	Okay. Thanks Oprah! You're a real friend.	[]

Towelie	40	0	All right, I got one chance here. I need to focus and come up with what I'm gonna say.  Maybe I should get a little high.  No! Wait a minute! I'm not going to get high this time.	[]
Joint	16	0	Aw, come on. You need to come up with ideas of what to say on Oprah.	[]
Towelie	16	0	But, the ideas I come up with when I'm high keep gettin' me in trouble.	[]

Man 7	16	0	Yeah, it sure was. We're sorry we tried to burn you and murder you before.	[]
Towelie	36	0	Aw, that's okay. This whole thing was my fault. I learned that I shouldn't get high to come up with ideas. I should come up with ideas and then get high, to reward myself.	[]
Joint	3	0	Youuu said it.	[]
