Stan	16	0	Dude, what are we gonna do for New Year's Eve? It has to be awesome.	[]
Kyle	13	0	I know. It's probably gonna be the biggest night of our lives!	[]
Cartman	6	0	You guys! You guys!  Guess what?	[]
Kyle	2	0	What, fatass?!	[]
Cartman	10	0	I've become a man! I started puberty, you guys!	[]
Kenny	1	0	(...What?)	[]
Stan	4	0	No you didn't!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Yes! I really did.	[]
Stan	4	0	How do you know?	[]
Cartman	7	0	Well, because yesterday I got my period.	[]
Kyle	4	0	You got your what?	[]
Cartman	37	1	My period, you guys. You see, there comes a time in every child's life when they grow up and nature takes its course by having you bleed out your ass for a few days every month.	['ass']
Stan	15	0	You're making that up!  Miss Aliton, what's it mean to get a period?	[]
Miss Aliton	12	0	Well boys, ah-I don't think I can tell you. Ah-	[]
Stan	4	0	Please, it's important.	[]
Miss Aliton	13	0	Well, it's when puberty hits and you bleed, you know, down there.	[]
Kyle	6	1	Holy shit, dude! Cartman's right!	['shit']
Cartman	53	0	Well guys, I'm afraid I won't be able to hang out with you on New Year's Eve. I have to hang out with the older crowd because now, I'm ma-ture.  I got my period, and you guys didn't. I got my period, and you guys didn't.	[]
Stan	8	0	Dude, Cartman can't hit puberty before us.	[]
Kyle	21	1	Well, maybe we'll get ours soon, too. I'm gonna go and see if I'm bleeding out my ass.	['ass']
Kenny	2	0	(Me too.)	[]
Anchorman	109	0	In local news, a stomach virus is going around that is causing bleeding of the colon in some small children. Doctors are telling parents that the virus is nothing to worry about and that the infections can be dealt with simple antibiotics.  Well, it's just four days until New Year's Eve, 1999. The new millennium is almost upon us, and all over the world people have started to celebrate by dancing, singing, and killing one another.  But probably the biggest event of the millennium is one happening in South Park, Colorado, where people have gathered for a chance to see Jesus Christ. Craig Netzel is standing by.	[]
Netzel	85	0	Thanks, Tom. It is indeed four days until the new millennium, and hundreds if not thousands of people have come from all over the world seeking Jesus, here at his house in South Park.  Everyone is giddy with anticipation for Jesus to come out, because as we all know, if Jesus comes out of his house and is not scared by his shadow, it means the next thousand years will be full of peace and love.  Oh, it looks like Jesus might be coming out!	[]
Woman	10	0	Oh look, Tommy. There he is. Can you see him?	[]
Boy	4	0	He's neat, Mommy.	[]
Netzel	28	0	Everyone is quiet here, Tom. Looks like the little fellow's a bit nervous.  But he has taken another step out, Tom! This is great new for us!	[]
Jesus	14	0	Uh-mmm, um what are you people doing?  Can I help you with something?	[]
Netzel	6	0	...Well, it's... the millennium, Jesus.	[]
Jesus	2	0	Uuh-huh?	[]
Netzel	5	0	Well, it's The Millennium.	[]
Man 1	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Man 2	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Man 3	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Cameraman	1	0	Right.	[]
Jesus	6	0	So, what happens at the millennium?	[]
Netzel	4	0	...I don't know.	[]
Jimbo	4	0	We thought you did.	[]
Man 4	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Man 5	4	0	Yeah, you're Jesus.	[]
Man 6	1	0	Hey!	[]
Man 5	6	0	You're the one in control.	[]
Jesus	11	0	Oh. Well. Yea. Believe in me and ye shall find peace.	[]
Mr. Garrison	27	1	Yeah yeah yeah, we've heard that crap for about 2000 years now! We wanna hear somethin' new! It's the year 2000, for Christ's sake!	['crap']
Crowd	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Jesus	5	0	Well, what do ya want?	[]
Fr. Maxi	5	0	We want to see God!	[]
Randy	5	0	Yeah, with our own eyes.	[]
Crowd	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Jimbo	24	0	We followed blindly for thousands of years and we think the least God can do is show up for New Year's Eve 1999!	[]
Crowd	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Woman	3	0	That's right!	[]
Jesus	10	0	Oh. Uuuh, let me think about that for a minute.	[]
Man With Picket Sign	3	0	Is that good?	[]
Man 7	4	0	I don't know.	[]
Man 8	9	0	I don't know. Is that good or not?!	[]
Stan	1	0	Hello?	[]
Kyle	7	0	Dude, did you get your period yet?	[]
Stan	10	1	No, there's no blood coming out of my ass.	['ass']
Kyle	17	0	Mine neither. But I double-checked, and Cartman was right. Your period is the start of puberty.	[]
Stan	32	0	Well, if Cartman is the only one who get it and he thinks he's too grown-up to hang out with us on New Year's Eve, then screw him anyways.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Woohoo!  Woohoooo!)	[]
Stan	12	0	Come on, Cartman, we have to make plans for New Year's.	[]
Cartman	37	1	Hold your horses, guys. This is very important for mature people.  Let's see. Offers complete protection during heavy flow, hm.  Lessee, might slow stoppage of vaginal chunks, eh.  Oh, this one's got wings, you guys!	['vaginal']
Kenny	13	0	(You guys! You guys, I did it! I got my very own period!)	[]
Cartman	2	0	You did?	[]
Kyle	6	0	You got your period too, Kenny?	[]
Kenny	15	0	(Yeah, it was awesome! I was just sitting down and then I got my period!)	[]
Cartman	52	0	Well welcome to the club, Kenny. You got your period, so now you're a man. We can hang out together on New Year's Eve.  But first you need to buy some Maxi pads to stuff in the back of your pants so you don't get blood on your underwear.	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Woo-hoo!)	[]
Netzel	38	0	Tom, it looked for a second as if Jesus was going to come out of his house, but then he went back inside. But meanwhile, more and more people are showing up to show their support for Jesus.	[]
Rancher	33	0	Well, the way I see it, if he really is who he says he is, well then he'd better do somethin' on New Year's Eve, 'cause it's in the Bible!	[]
Jesus	12	0	Father, I need to talk to you. Please, Father, appear to me.	[]
God	5	0	What is it, my child?	[]
Jesus	22	0	Father, everyone is starting to pay attention to me again because of the new millennium. Huh-I'm kinda making a comeback!	[]
God	12	0	Yea, like John Travolta before you. You are experiencing a second revival.	[]
Jesus	10	0	It's the millennium, Father. People want to see you.	[]
God	13	0	Nay, their eyes are not yet prepared to see the likes of me.	[]
Jesus	14	0	But dad, I think this may be my one big shot at a comeback.	[]
God	6	0	Be ye careful of pride, Jesus.	[]
Jesus	21	0	Just make an appearance. You can come down, say 'hi' to a few people and can be back by 12:30.	[]
God	21	0	I'm sorry, my son, but if you want to earn everyone's love, you will have to do it yourself.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Ike, can I talk to you?	[]
Ike	3	0	Uh ar, stufid.	[]
Kyle	36	0	Ike, I don't know what to do. All the guys are getting their periods, and I don't think I am. I can't be the last one to get it. I just can't!	[]
Ike	4	0	Whoa won toooo-reeee.	[]
Kyle	28	0	Cartman got his, then Kenny. What if tomorrow Stan says he got his and I'm left out? I might not even get to be their friend anymore.	[]
Ike	8	1	No. Martur sucker. Moghee. Muckeh m'gwoss. Tabyudog.	['sucker']
Kyle	44	0	Yeah! I could just say I got my period! It's not like they'll check. I can just say I got my period, 'cause I really will get it someday! It's not really lying, it's just jumping the gun a little.	[]
Ike	2	0	Cokeh mocker.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Thanks a lot, Ike!	[]
Stan	13	0	So you guys aren't gonna spend New Year's Eve with us?	[]
Cartman	27	0	Look, Kenny and I are mature now. We can't spend New Year's Eve with a couple of kids. Did you get your Maxi pads, Kenny?	[]
Kenny	10	1	(No. All I could get was a couple of tampons.)	['tampons']
Cartman	5	2	Tampon? What's a tampon?	['tampon', 'tampon']
Kenny	15	2	(See, a tampon is what you stick up your ass so you don't bleed.)	['tampon', 'ass']
Cartman	5	0	Ew, doesn't that hurt?	[]
Kenny	2	0	(A little.)	[]
Kyle	7	0	You guys! I got my period, too!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Wow, cool!	[]
Stan	2	0	You did?	[]
Kyle	17	0	Yeah!  I was just hanging out in my room, and then I perioded all over the place.	[]
Cartman	35	0	All right! You have to be in me and Kenny's club, then. My mom gave me this Women Who Run With The Wolves book and I'm finding out all about our goddess powers.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Awesome! We get powers?	[]
Cartman	35	0	Yeah! Come on, we can set everything up in my clubhouse and get ready for New Year's Eve!  Hey, don't feel bad, Stan. Some of us just mature a little later than others.	[]
Stan	44	0	Are you there, God? It's me, Stan. If you wouldn't mind, I don't wanna be the only kid who doesn't get his period before the new year. Could you speed up my development a little? Thanks, God. Your friend, Stan	[]
Jesus	80	0	Are you there, God? It's me, Jesus. I feel like I've got a real shot at a comeback, God. For whatever reason, people are starting to follow me again. I'm 2000 years old, but I feel like I'm 28 again! I think I'm going to win everybody back, because I just made a few phone calls, and I'm going to put on the most amazing New Year's spectacle this world has ever seen!	[]
Phillip	5	0	Oh God, you're smelly!	[]
Announcer	18	0	Good morning, South Park, it's 8 a.m.,  and only two more days until the new millennium!	[]
Stan	4	4	Dammit! Dammit dammit dammit!	['dammit', 'dammit', 'dammit', 'dammit']
Sharon	6	0	Stanley, honey, what's the matter?	[]
Stan	7	0	I'm not bleeding out my aahass!	[]
Sharon	5	0	Well, that's good, honey.	[]
Stan	68	0	No it's not! It's terrible!  Are you there, God? It's me, Stan. How come you didn't help me? I know you're really busy with things, but this is a matter of life and death. If I don't get my period, my friends won't let me hang out with them on New Year's Eve. Please, please give me my period soon.	[]
Jimbo	3	0	Here he comes!	[]
Mr. Garrison	4	0	He's coming out!	[]
Jesus	100	0	...I have given it much thought, my children, and you are right. After reviewing the Bible, it does indeed say that something very big is going to happen at the millennium.  I have spoken to my Father in heaven, and he agreed that the millennium is significant to all of us. And ye who believe in me SHALL be rewarded!  So what we're going to do tomorrow night, New Year's Eve, 1999: we just got ROD STEWART to agree to play a comeback concert at the Rio Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, and you're all going!	[]
Man	7	0	...We knew you could do it, Jesus!	[]
Mr. Garrison	11	1	Well, I'd better book my ass a flight to Vegas!	['ass']
Fr. Maxi	8	0	For he is Savior For he is Lord	[]
Crowd	19	0	He gives me hope when I have only been bored And he lifts me up with His gentle arm...	[]
Cartman	7	0	Okay, is everyone accounted for? Goddess Wind?	[]
Kyle	1	0	Here.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Goddess Moon? Goddess Moon?!	[]
Kenny	2	1	(Dammit, here!)	['dammit']
Cartman	54	0	And I'm here, Goddess Earthly Delight. So this is the first meeting of our club for teens who have gotten their periods. We're supposed to talk about our periods. And boys. Let's talk about boys first. I think Craig is pretty cool, but I don't think Clyde is very cool.	[]
Kyle	14	0	I think Clyde is kind of cool, but Craig is definitely cooler than Clyde.	[]
Kenny	23	0	(Yes, I agree. I think Craig is a thousand times as cool as Clyde. There doesn't really seem to be a doubt.)	[]
Cartman	14	0	Okay, that settles that. Now let's talk about our periods. Kyle, you first.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Oh. Ah-ah. Ah-uh-m-m.	[]
Cartman	5	0	What's the matter, Kyle?	[]
Kyle	13	0	Nothing. Um , my period is really uuuh...  Uuuh, my period is going swimmingly.	[]
Cartman	9	0	...Okay, that makes sense. Mine is going swimmingly, too.	[]
Kenny	3	0	(And mine too.)	[]
Kyle	1	0	Phew.	[]
Chef	3	0	Oh, hello Stan.	[]
Stan	2	0	Hey, Chef.	[]
Chef	4	0	How's it going?	[]
Stan	1	0	Bad.	[]
Chef	2	0	Why bad?	[]
Stan	4	0	Can I come in?	[]
Chef	9	0	Well, sure.  Now, what's the matter, little cracker?	[]
Stan	28	0	Chef, I have ...this friend, see? And this person is really bummed out, because everyone else the same age has gotten their period, and this person hasn't.	[]
Chef	9	0	OOH, you're talkin' about your older sister, Shelly.	[]
Stan	1	0	No.	[]
Chef	4	0	Your little girlfriend, Wendy.	[]
Stan	22	0	Look, it doesn't matter who it is. The point is that everyone else got their period and this person hasn't.	[]
Chef	10	0	Look, Stan. Do you really know what a period is?	[]
Stan	4	0	Yeah, Cartman told us.	[]
Chef	21	0	Stan, let me sing you a little song about the menstrual cycle. I think it might clear things up for you.	[]
Stan	1	0	Okay.	[]
Chef	93	0	Ooo baby, yeah baby, ooo baby. Yeah baby, yeah baby, now baby. Ooo yeah, yes yes baby Yeahyeahyeah, uh-huh baby now Agh! Agh! Awww! No, baby! Ewww, baby! No, no! Alright now-I'm alright, I'm-I'm cool, it's okay. Uh alright, watch out for the bedspread, baby. Look out now, it's- alright, I'll tell you what. Uuh, how about uuh, uh. Why don't I call you next week? And that's my song about the menstrual cycle, Stan. Did that clear things up for you?	[]
Stan	21	0	...So what you're saying is, this person shouldn't be bummed because everybody has their period at a different time.	[]
Chef	5	0	...Is that what I said?	[]
Stan	76	1	But it's not fair! It's not fair that one day you're on top, that you're the coolest kid in town, and then the next day you're at the bottom again, 'cause everyone has blood coming out their ass but you, and if I can't menstruate, then by God, I'm not gonna sit around and be the only periodless 8-year-old boy! I'm gonna do something about it!	['ass']
Chef	9	0	Whoa! I musta missed a WHOLE middle part there.	[]
Agent	31	0	I can't tell you how excited Rod Stewart is about this millennium concert. He's gotten a little older, but you're gonna see how much he can still rock.	[]
Jesus	30	0	Hoh, I'm excited too. I think it will bring my Father's children back to their faith and back to mine eyes, for I an the Lamb of God.	[]
Agent	34	0	Yeah t-and uh, you know, Rod is a seasoned veteran, so I'm gonna have to ask for a bit more cash, but we could talk about that later; here comes Rod now.	[]
Rod	3	0	Hullo-o-o.	[]
Jesus	6	0	Hey, Rod, great to see you.	[]
Rod	1	0	Oh.	[]
Jesus	39	0	Uh, the folks are sure glad you're playing. It's really given them a lot of faith in me again. I'm sure that together, we can make this millennium party the best New Year's bash ever!	[]
Rod	2	0	Pooped pants.	[]
Jesus	1	0	What?	[]
Rod	2	0	Pooped pants.	[]
Jesus	2	1	Poo pants?	['poo']
Rod	3	0	Pooped 'nmuh pants.	[]
Jesus	5	0	Uh, you pooped your pants?	[]
Rod	4	0	Pooped in my pants.	[]
Jesus	11	0	Oh Uh-n nurse? Mr. Stewart has apparently pooped his pants?	[]
Nurse	15	0	Again?!  Now, Mr. Stewart, what did we say about trying to hold in Mr. Dookie?	[]
Dr. Mephesto	18	0	Yes, puberty is a very wonderful thing, Stan. It's what links us all together, makes us one.	[]
Stan	12	0	But what happens if there's someone who never went through puberty.	[]
Dr. Mephesto	9	0	Never went through puberty? Who never went through puberty?	[]
Stan	9	0	Nn-nobody! I mean, uh, well, m-my dad.	[]
Dr. Mephesto	6	0	Your father never went through puberty?	[]
Stan	18	0	No. And uh, that's why he sent me here; 'cause he's too embarrassed to come himself.	[]
Dr. Mephesto	9	0	Oh, I can't say that I blame him.	[]
Stan	9	0	So do you know anything that can help him?	[]
Dr. Mephesto	11	0	Well, I should think the most logical solution would be... hormones.	[]
Stan	1	0	Hormones?	[]
Dr. Mephesto	35	0	Yes!  Here, and tell your father to take just one of these pills every week. It could be just what he needs. And be sure to tell him that his secret is safe with me.	[]
Stan	9	0	Thanks a lot, Dr. Mephesto. You're the best!	[]
Dr. Mephesto	7	0	My pleasure. I just love helping people.	[]
Cartman	34	0	Now, for our first club activity, we're supposed to reach into this little dish and pull out a word. We look at the word and think about what that word means to us.	[]
Kyle	13	0	Okay. Today's word is spirituality. What that means to me is uh-	[]
Stan	2	1	Hey assholes!	['assholes']
Cartman	14	0	Oh, look. It's that little boy who hasn't gotten his period yet.	[]
Stan	11	0	Don't you worry about that! I've started taking hormones!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Hormones?	[]
Stan	29	0	Yeah, they make you have your puberty quicker. And I'm just here to tell you that my puberty is gonna be bigger than any of you guys's!	[]
Kyle	13	0	Dude, I don't think 8-year olds are supposed to take hormones.	[]
Cartman	17	0	Yeah, you shouldn't force your period, Stan. You should let it come, like the morning dew.	[]
Stan	10	0	So what are we gonna do for New Year's?	[]
Cartman	24	0	Well, we're going with our families to Las Vegas. I guess there'll be some younger kids there, too, if you wanna go.	[]
Stan	9	0	Aaaargh. I'm gonna go take some more hormones.	[]
Cartman	17	0	Now, the word is spirituality. I believe that the goddess in me is my spirituality because she-	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Ooooowwwwwwwhh.)	[]
Cartman	11	0	Quiet, Kenny. The goddess lives in all of us and has-	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Oh- ooowww!)	[]
Cartman	6	2	Goddammit, Kenny, shut the hell up!	['goddammit', 'hell']
Kenny	1	0	(Aaaaaa!)	[]
Kyle	2	0	Whoa, dude!	[]
Dr. Doctor	4	0	Mr. and Ms. McCormick.	[]
McCormick Parents	1	0	Yes?	[]
Dr. Doctor	9	0	I'm sorry. We... couldn't save your son.	[]
Ms. McCormick	13	0	Oh my God, my little Kenny's gone. I can't believe it.	[]
Dr. Doctor	15	0	We just didn't get to him in time. There's nothing we could do.	[]
Stuart	6	0	What happened? What killed him, doctor?	[]
Dr. Doctor	38	2	Well, we found a... tampon stuck up your child's ass. Apparently, he'd had it up there for several days. It plugged him up until he finally burst from the inside out like a ruptured septic tank.	['tampon', 'ass']
Ms. McCormick	3	0	Oh my God.	[]
Dr. Doctor	38	2	My worry is that he could have been following some kind of crazy new fad. Perhaps the children are all shoving tampons up their ass because they've seen the Backstreet Boys doing it on TV or something.	['tampons', 'ass']
Ms. McCormick	2	0	Gi-ih	[]
Dr. Doctor	35	0	We must get to the bottom of this! ...if you'll pardon the pun. But actually, right now, I've got to catch a plane to Las Vegas to see the Rod Stewart Millennium Show.	[]
Stuart	7	0	Rod Stewart's gonna be in Vegas?	[]
Netzel	70	0	Tom, I'm here live in Las Vegas, where tomorrow night THE New Year's Eve event is going to happen. Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior, is presenting Rod Stewart, the undisputed King of Pop, right here at this hotel behind me.  It looks as though Jesus really has come through.  Everyone is very excited, because rumor has it that God Himself is gonna show up to the event.	[]
Jesus	1	0	What??	[]
Netzel	15	0	How about you, ma'am? Do you think God is gonna show up tomorrow night?	[]
Ma'am	17	0	Of course he is. This is Jesus we're talking about. He wouldn't let us down.	[]
Jesus	16	0	Oh no! Are you there, God? Father, will you please reconsider and show up tomorrow?  ...Hello?	[]
Sharon	12	0	Stanley.  Wake up, honey. It's time to leave for Las Vegas.	[]
Stan	9	1	Who-o-oa, du-ude. I've got boobs.	['boobs']
Cartman	12	0	Hey, Las Vegas is a pretty cool place for us mature people.	[]
Jesus	24	0	Alright, people. Are we ready to rock the millennium?!  Father in heaven, please let tonight's show go well. Please make them like it.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Hey, here comes Stan.	[]
Stan	4	0	Have I missed anything?	[]
Cartman	9	1	Wow, Stan, you really got some nice titties there.	['titties']
Kyle	7	0	Did you get your period yet, Stan?	[]
Stan	5	0	No. I didn't, but-	[]
Cartman	26	1	Buh- Don't worry. You'll get it someday. Come on, Kyle. Let's go see what kind of tampons they have here in Las Vegas.	['tampons']
Jesus	47	1	Well, I tell you one thing. I sure as heck am excited. We've got about four hours to the new year, and so I think it's time to START IT UP! Ladies and gentlemen, as promised, Mr. Rod Do You Think I'm Sexy? Stewart!	['sexy']
Rod	14	0	O-o-oh.  O-oh.  O-o-o-oh. Be-eh-o-o-or.	[]
Jimbo	2	0	Whoa, man.	[]
Rod	4	0	Oh. Uh pooped 'em.	[]
Mr. Garrison	3	1	This sucks balls!	['balls']
Blonde	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Man 7	7	0	Alright, enough of this! Bring out God!	[]
Man 9	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Jesus	2	0	Oh no.	[]
Crowd	9	0	We want God! We want God! We want God!	[]
Jesus	4	0	Please, Father. Do something.	[]
Crowd	3	0	We want God!	[]
Jesus	11	0	Uh, folks, I'm afraid God can't make it tonight.	[]
Randy	10	0	We came all the way to Las Vegas for this?!	[]
Woman	12	0	This is the worst New Year's ever! Thanks a lot, Jesus!	[]
Skeeter	4	0	Let's get him!	[]
Netzel	43	1	Well, Tom, I'm here live in Las Vegas in what is quickly becoming known as the gayest party ever. Everyone is so outraged that they are building a large cross in which to once again crucify our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.	['gayest']
Stan	6	0	Jesus, why does God hate me?	[]
Jesus	17	0	Huh? He doesn't hate you, he hates me. He's gonna let me be crucified again.	[]
Stan	21	0	He hates me more. He doesn't answer my prayers. I prayed to him every day and he never answered me.	[]
Jesus	20	0	Well, yeah, but just because God doesn't answer your prayers doesn't mean he doesn't care about you.	[]
Stan	11	0	Well then, why didn't he give me what I wanted?	[]
Jesus	23	0	Well, God can't just answer every prayer and suddenly give you everything you want. That takes all the living out of life.	[]
Stan	4	0	What do you mean?	[]
Jesus	61	0	If God answered all our prayers, there'd be nothing left for us to do ourselves. Life is about problems, and overcoming those problems.  A-and growing and learning from obstacles. If God just fixed everything for us, then there'd be no point in our existence.  That's why he wouldn't show up to my New Year's party.	[]
Stan	5	0	I just wanted my period.	[]
Jesus	33	0	I get it now, Father. I had to learn all this on my own.  I was overcome with my new popularity and, and I let pride get in the way of good judgment.	[]
Man	4	0	Whoa, what is that??	[]
Jesus	3	0	It's Dad.	[]
Fr. Maxi	7	0	God? God is going to show himself??	[]
Woman	5	0	Look, I can see him.	[]
Jesus	3	0	Father. You came.	[]
God	18	0	Now look upon Me, My children, and know Me.  Be ye not afraid.  Blessed art thou, my children.	[]
Randy	3	0	That's God?	[]
Jesus	18	0	Yea, 'tis my Father, the Creator. He is the Alpha and the Omega.  The Beginning and the End.	[]
Mr. Garrison	4	0	Well, yeah, but that??	[]
God	10	0	What did you expect me to look like, My son?	[]
Mr. Garrison	4	0	...Well not like that!	[]
God	21	0	Since it is the end of the first 2000 years, I will allow you, My children, to ask me one question.	[]
Gerald	2	0	One question?	[]
Mr. Mackey	2	0	Only one?	[]
Sharon	5	0	What should we ask him?	[]
Chef	24	0	We have to think carefully. We can ask him anything we want, like, What's the meaning of life? or Why are we here?.	[]
Stan	26	0	I have it. I have the question.  Now you have to answer me once and for all! How come I haven't gotten my period yet?!	[]
God	41	1	My child, you are a boy. Boys do not get periods. That's only for girls. Your friends were bleeding a little bit out of their asses because of an acute colon infection. And your friend Kyle simply lied about it.	['asses']
Kyle	4	0	How do know that?	[]
God	33	1	You will hit puberty when the time is right. But you will never have a period, because you are a man - with titties. Thus spaketh the Lord. And now I return to heaven.	['titties']
Mr. Garrison	11	0	Hey, wait! That doesn't count as our question, does it??	[]
God	13	0	I'll answer another on New Year's Eve, in the year 4000.	[]
Stan	71	0	Did you hear that everybody? I'm not even supposed to have my period; that's why God wasn't answering me before!  Boy, I'm sure everything worked out okay.  I guess now we can all celebrate the New Year, huh? Should auld acquaintance be forgot And never brought to mind? Should auld acquaintance be forgot And auld lang syne? For auld lang syne, my dear, For auld lang syne...	[]
Skeeter	4	0	Let's get him.	[]
Stan	7	0	Let's have a cup o-Aaaa!	[]
