Woman	8	1	You motherfucker! I never should have married you!	['motherfucker']
Tiger	7	0	You're overreacting, you stupid Swedish cow!	[]
Elin	21	1	Then why-a the fuck are you getting a text-a message from some-a low-life-a hooker on Thanksgiving?!	['fuck']
Tiger	10	1	God, shut up!  Shut! Up!  Where are my fucking pills?!	['fucking']
Elin	9	0	Oh yeah! Take more vitamins, Tiger! That'll help!!	[]
Tiger	6	0	Will you just listen to me?!	[]
Elin	4	0	Listen to this-a!	[]
Tiger	4	2	Aaaah!  You fucking whore!	['fucking', 'whore']
Elin	11	1	Oh where the fuck do ya think-a you're going?!	['fuck']
Tiger	8	1	I'm getting the fuck away from you!	['fuck']
Elin	5	1	Open the door, you motherfucker!	['motherfucker']
Cartman	10	0	Ooo yeah, take that from me in the car, Kenny!	[]
Stan	5	0	What are you guys doing?	[]
Cartman	15	0	Dude, check it out! It's EA Sports Tiger Woods PGA Tour '11 for Xbox.	[]
Tiger	5	2	D'Aaaah! Fuck you, cunt!	['fuck', 'cunt']
Cartman	15	0	Stop breaking through the window, Kenny! Whoa, I'm gonna crash I'm gonna crash!	[]
Tiger	8	1	Aw, look what you did, you crazy bitch!	['bitch']
Elin	7	1	It serves you right, you cheating turd!	['turd']
Cartman	7	0	Oh dude, was that a combo move?	[]
Kenny	6	1	(Yeah dude, I fucked you up.)	['fucked']
Cartman	15	0	Dude, here come the cops! We've gotta lie to them. Hit X to lie.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Wow, I didn't know golf games were this cool.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Yeah dude, EA Sports outdid themselves this time.	[]
Chairman	60	1	I've gathered you together here because you are the best minds our country has to offer. As you've all seen on the news, our country is facing a major crisis, and we need to find out what's causing it.  Why? Why are rich successful men suddenly going out and trying to have sex with lots of women?	['sex']
Expert 1	29	0	Tiger Woods was only the most prevalent, but our data shows that the numbers are growing. David Letterman and before that, Bill Clinton. There's a pattern here, people.	[]
Expert 2	22	1	Why would a man who's famous and makes tons of money use that and have sex with lots of different women?	['sex']
Chairman	23	2	Aand these rich celebrities have perfectly good wives at home. Why would they even think of sex with others? Dammit!  I want answers!	['sex', 'dammit']
Expert 3	12	1	We believe that it may be an outbreak of sex addiction, sir.	['sex']
Chairman	2	1	Sex awhowho?	['sex']
Expert 4	41	2	It's a new phenomena we don't completely understand yet, but it... seems to make people... different. Of course, we all know the normal healthy male thinks only of sex occasionally and has no desire for sex with multiple partners.	['sex', 'sex']
Expert 5	2	0	Definitely true.	[]
Chairman	7	0	Yes, we all know that, go on.	[]
Expert 4	33	2	But in the sex addict, their entire lives are consumed with thoughts of wanting more and more. The mere sight of an attractive woman could... can make them think about sex with her.	['sex', 'sex']
Expert 6	16	0	But what about love? How could tons of fame and money make you forget about love?	[]
Chairman	9	1	What could be causing this outbreak of sexual addiction?	['sexual']
Expert 7	16	0	It could be caused by something in the water supply. Uh, perhaps even by - global warming.	[]
Expert 8	2	0	Or cooling.	[]
Expert 9	1	0	Yes	[]
Expert 7	11	0	If.so, then the disease could start to affect our children	[]
Chairman	27	0	That does it!  I want health screening at all our nation's schools! We need to find out if any young people might be carrying this disease.	[]
Expert 9	66	0	Good afternoon, students. We are going to be a doing a health screening today. It won't take long, it'll be relatively painless, but we need to see if any students are showing... symptoms.  I'n a moment, I'm going to show you a suggestive picture.  And then I'm going to ask you a question about that picture. Alright, ready? Here we go.	[]
The class	3	0	Oh! Wow. Ohhh.	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Woo hoo!)	[]
Kyle	2	0	Jesus, dude.	[]
Butters	14	0	Holy moly, what's that between the lady's legs? It's all bushy.	[]
Expert 9	25	0	Please just study the picture the best you can, students. I'll then ask you the question which you'll answer on the paper provided.	[]
Butters	19	0	I've never seen that part of a lady! Do they all got a hedge like that? Do they??	[]
Expert 9	31	0	Okay, very good.  Now, what color... was the handkerchief in the nice lady's hand? Write down your answer, please: what color was the handkerchief... in the nice lady's hand?	[]
Butters	13	0	Did you see that bush on that lady?? What the heck was that??	[]
Expert 9	7	0	Very good, turn your answers over please.	[]
Butters	11	0	Gee whiz, it was like almost up to her belly button!	[]
Expert 9	33	0	Alright, now, who answered that the handkerchief was... yellow?  Very good, very good indeed. Now I'd like to see who answered What handkerchief?  A-ha! You three boys, please come with me.	[]
Kyle	12	0	I didn't see a handkerchief. Did you see a handkerchief, Kenny?	[]
Kenny	9	1	(Fuck no, I wasn't looking at a handkerchief!)	['fuck']
Expert 9	16	1	I'm sorry boys, but I'm afraid you three have tested positive for sex addiction.	['sex']
Kyle	1	0	What?!	[]
Butters	2	0	Oh no!	[]
Kenny	3	1	(Who fuckin' cares?)	['fuckin']
Expert 9	11	0	We're gonna have to send you home, I'm afraid.	[]
Kyle	9	1	Wait, we're sex addicts? Uh-are you sure?	['sex']
Expert 9	28	0	Our nice-lady-with-the-handkerchief test is extremely comprehensive and thorough. I'm sorry, but you're simply too dangerous to have around normal, well-adjusted students.	[]
Butters	14	0	It was just... so big and bushy sir. Why does it look like that?	[]
Kyle	6	0	So what happens to us now?	[]
Expert 9	51	0	A life of desperation and anguish, I'm afraid. Your addiction will start off slowly - magazines, Internet sites - but then, as you keep chasing your high your tastes will get more and more dangerous. Most likely you'll end up going the way of David Carradine and Michael Hutchence: autoerotic asphyxiation.	[]
Kenny	5	0	(Autoerotic asphyxiation? What's that?)	[]
Expert 9	44	0	I don't want to go into too much detail but... you choke yourself with a belt around your neck while masturbating dressed up like Batman or something, then you pass out from lack of air and apparently it makes your orgasm super awesome.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Really??)	[]
Butters	12	0	Oh no. I don't wanna have to buy a Batman costume.	[]
Chairman	34	1	Ladies and gentlemen, for the past several days we've been screening our nation's schools for signs of sex addiction. The results of our tests are troubling to say the least. Dr. Tonton?	['sex']
Dr. Tonton	37	1	In fourth graders, five percent of male students were found to be sex addicts. By sixth grade the number goes up to thirty percent. At high schools, nearly ninety-one percent of male students answered, What handkerchief?	['sex']
Chairman	36	1	We're facing a sex addiction epidemic in our country. Young people all over America are infected, and at extreme risk to themselves and to the people around them.  They're leading lives of secret pain.	['sex']
Reporter 1	23	1	And so these infected boys will soon be secretly wishing they could be having sex all the time with lots of different people?	['sex']
Chairman	3	0	It appears so.	[]
Reporter 1	3	1	The poor bastards!	['bastards']
Reporter 2	13	0	But what about us normal healthy adults? Are we at risk of exposure?	[]
Chairman	30	1	We don't believe so. In adult males, for whatever reason, sex addiction only seems to be problematic amongst rich successful celebrities.  However, we are still collecting data, and all-	['sex']
Randy	18	1	Why would wealth and success cause a man to go out and have sex with everyone he could?	['sex']
Chairman	16	0	-answers which we all desire.  Whatever is causing this outbreak, we guarantee we will find it!	[]
Mrs. McCormick	8	0	Kenny, it's time for dinner!  Kenny?  AAAA!	[]
Priest	25	0	Sunset and Evening Star, and one clear call for me, and may their be no moaning of the bar when I put out to sea.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Oh God, it's true.	[]
Priest	24	0	But such a tide as moving seems asleep, too full for sound and foam, when that which drew from out the boundless deep t-	[]
Butters	36	0	There! It was like that! It looked just like that!  Just like this, buh, but smaller, and right in the place where her underwear should've been. If I trim it down, it'll look right..	[]
Kyle	4	0	Butters! Butters, stop it!	[]
Butters	10	0	But this is what I keep seeing in my head!	[]
Kyle	17	0	Butters, we are sick! Don't you get it?! We're gonna end up just like Kenny!	[]
Butters	14	0	No, uh, if I can just see it again, I, I'll be fine.	[]
Kyle	3	0	No! Butters, stop!	[]
Butters	4	0	Haah! Leave me alone!	[]
Kyle	9	0	Stop it! Stop!  Oh God! Oh God, help us!	[]
Commentator	16	0	Tiger... lines up his drive. He'll be hoping for a birdie here. Concentration is key.	[]
Elin	8	1	You motherfucker! I never should have married you!	['motherfucker']
Tiger	4	1	Aaagh! Goddamnit, stop it!	['goddamnit']
Elin	9	1	How many women did you fuck-a?! How many?!	['fuck']
Stan	5	0	Aw dude, I clocked you!	[]
Cartman	8	0	I told you this game was sweet, dude.	[]
Stan	11	0	Hang on, hang on, I'm switching to a 7-iron.	[]
Cartman	14	1	Oh! O-oh! Oh man, I lost another endorsement! How'd you do that?	['endorsement']
Stan	5	0	Hit A and X together.	[]
Announcer	3	0	Round 2. Fight!!	[]
Cartman	6	0	Oh, you're going down, Elin!	[]
Stan	13	0	I don't think so dude, I got the pre-nup power-up.	[]
Announcer	4	0	Pre-nup power-up.	[]
Cartman	12	0	Oh no!  Pre-nup? Weak. When'd you get that power-up?	[]
Therapist	28	1	All right, sex addicts. What other destructive behaviors that we engaged in that led to our ultimate downfall?  Anyone have another example? Let's see, how about... David!	['sex']
David Letterman	7	1	Haha, Oh, ahh, having sex with employees.	['sex']
Therapist	12	1	Sex with employees. Definitely a danger there. What else? Uh, Mr. Clinton.	['sex']
Bill Clinton	5	1	Putting cigars in girls' vaginas?	['vaginas']
Therapist	11	1	Very good, Billy.  cigars in vaginas. Not the best idea there.	['vaginas']
Charlie Sheen	7	1	Watching Internet porn all day every day?	['porn']
Therapist	47	1	Spot on, Charlie Sheen! Excessive  Internet porn. Now, the reason we are making this list is that we have new members today. I want you all to welcome Kyle and Bummers. The men all turn to look at the boys, who are seated in the last row.	['porn']
Kyle	1	0	Hello?	[]
The men	4	0	Hey Kyle, hi Kyle.	[]
Therapist	11	0	And would you care to share your stories with us, boys?	[]
Kyle	22	1	Well, I just found out I'm a sex addict. I'm so scared, I haven't even told my mom yet.	['sex']
Bill Clinton	6	1	Does your mom have big tits?	['tits']
Therapist	1	0	Billy!	[]
Bill Clinton	1	0	Sorry...	[]
Butters	12	0	Me, I just... Well I just can't stop thinking about bush.	[]
Ben Roethlisberger	3	0	I heard that.	[]
Butters	28	0	I mean it's like, what is it? What does it mean? Why would there be a bush right there? Is it a live bush? Are there berries?	[]
Therapist	6	0	Mr. Duchovny, please stop jerking off!	[]
David Duchovny	3	0	Aw, gee whiz!	[]
Expert 4	65	1	To better understand the sex addiction outbreak, we've been running tests on chimpanzees.  You can see that this entire community of specimens are getting along normally, some pairing off, others on their own, but now see this chimp here.  An average adult normal male blending in seamlessly with the others. Now watch. We're going to give it a lot of money.  Go ahead.	['sex']
Chairman	2	0	My God...	[]
Expert 4	8	0	Yes...  The subject is now isolated and shunned.	[]
Chairman	8	0	Incredible. And, and what's it doing now?	[]
Expert 4	8	0	Making a public apology on its talk show.	[]
Therapist	30	0	Alrighty. Now, we all know the destructive behaviors that got us into this predicament, don't we? What is the main thing we've all learned to avoid?  Yes, Tiger?	[]
Tiger Woods	4	1	Avoid drugs? And alcohol?	['drugs']
The other men	1	0	Auugh!	[]
Therapist	33	0	No, no, Tiger, you still aren't getting it.  In order to make sure we are no longer destroying our lives with any of these behaviors, we must avoid... anyone? Avoid getting... anyone?	[]
Michael Douglas	1	0	Caught.	[]
Therapist	4	0	Yes, Michael Douglas! Everyone!	[]
The Men	2	0	Getting caught.	[]
Therapist	21	0	Very good! You are all here in therapy  because you got caught! So how do we avoid getting caught? Ben Rothlisberger?	[]
Ben Rothlisberger	8	0	Don't screw girls in the public bathrooms?	[]
David Letterman	9	0	When they uh ask you for money, pay them.	[]
Therapist	2	0	Good, yes!	[]
Kyle	21	0	Whoa, hang on! We shouldn't be learning how not to get caught. We have to take responsibility for our actions.	[]
Bill Clinton	7	1	What the fuck are you talkin' about?	['fuck']
Kyle	30	0	Well, ah I mean, we have to accept that we have a problem, and put the blame completely on ourselves. I mean, maybe this isn't really even a disease.	[]
Therapist	23	2	Yeah, it's me. We've got a turd in the punch bowl. I repeat, we have a turd in the punch bowl.	['turd', 'turd']
Chairman	40	1	Mr. President, in every test the results were the same. The monkeys who were given cash always acted out their sexual addiction to dangerous levels. It appears that money has a direct effect on the virus's ability to develop.	['sexual']
Obama	13	0	So we must keep our nation's youth away from money and success.	[]
Chairman	26	1	No good, Mr. President. Because we've learned that sex addicts will find ways to make money and become successful in order to feed their addiction.	['sex']
Obama	23	1	You mean boys will start working towards being rich and successful just so they can one day have sex with lots of women??	['sex']
Chairman	43	0	Yes. That's why we decided to look at the cash itself for clues! We tried to find something in the hundred dollar bill that could explain why this is happening now. Then we looked at the backside, and found this.  Independence Hall.	[]
Obama	5	0	The birthplace of our country.	[]
Chairman	15	0	We believe something is happening in Independence Hall that gives money its power over men.	[]
Obama	61	1	Independence Hall... Independence Day... Aliens... Gentlemen, I might know what's causing the sex addiction outbreak. This is highly classified, but... in 1947 a flying saucer was discovered in Roswell, New Mexico. Two deceased alien bodies were recovered and hidden from public knowledge. They carried... a virus with them. A virus that only barely stopped from spreading all over the country.	['sex']
Chairman	29	1	And you think that these aliens... could be back with a new virus? One originating from Independence Hall causing rich successful men to have sex with lots of women?!	['sex']
Obama	9	0	It's the only explanation that makes any sense.	[]
Tiger	58	0	I want to say that I am deeply sorry for my irresponsible and selfish behavior. I know that I have severely disappointed all of you. Some have speculated that my wife somehow hurt or attacked me on Thanksgiving Night. It angers me that people would fabricate a story like that. She has shown nothing but grace and poise-	[]
Elin	2	1	You motherfucker!	['motherfucker']
Tiger	2	0	Oh no!	[]
Elin	6	0	I should have never married  youuu!	[]
Tiger	3	0	Agh! Stop it!	[]
Elin	8	2	A porn star?! You screwed a porn star?!	['porn', 'porn']
Cartman	12	0	Dude, you found another girl's phone number on my cell phone??	[]
Stan	18	1	Yeah, back in that water level.  Is Kyle still at sex-addiction therapy? That must be really intense.	['sex']
Kyle	8	0	Okay so, what exactly are we doing now?	[]
Therapist	15	0	We are on our way to help take of your diseases once and for all!	[]
Butters	10	0	Oh good, 'cause I really can't take it anymore.	[]
Therapist	13	0	Don't worry, as soon as it's dead everything will make sense.	[]
Kyle	6	0	...As soon as what's dead?	[]
Therapist	13	0	The infected alien that they just discovered is hiding out at Independence Hall!	[]
SWAT Officer 1	5	0	Entrance is clear, Mr. President.	[]
Chairman	11	0	Mr. President, you aren't safe here. Let us handle this.	[]
SWAT Officer 2	3	0	Right side clear!	[]
Expert 4	15	0	We must be careful. The alien could have cast some kind of spell of invisibility.	[]
Obama	10	0	Which would mean that the alien is also a wizard.	[]
Expert 10	25	1	Yes! It explains everything! A wizard alien would be able to cast a spell on our species, causing all the men to become sex addicts.	['sex']
Obama	12	0	Enough! We need to find the wizard alien and break his spell.	[]
SWAT Officer 2	142	1	Okay okay alright alright, hang, hang on guys. I mean, come on, this is getting a little ridiculous. Wizard aliens? We all know what's going on here, don't we? Whenever a story breaks about some rich famous guy going around and having sex with tons of girls, we all wanna act like we don't understand it, but we do. We're guys, you know? Our brains are wired to strive to be the alpha male and get all the women we can.  I mean, look where we are. Even, even Benjamin Franklin screwed everything that moved. Because he could. We don't have to condone what these rich, famous people do, but... we can at least admit that, given the same temptations and opportunities that somebody like Tiger Woods has, a lot of us guys might do somethin' similar.	['sex']
Obama	8	1	We have a turd in the punch bowl.	['turd']
Secret Service Agent	5	1	Turd in the punch bowl.	['turd']
SWAT Officer 2	14	0	Hey, what are you doin- No. No, come on.  Where are you takin' me?	[]
News 4 Reporter	45	1	Ten city blocks have been shut down because an alien is believed to have taken refuge here in Independence Hall. By all accounts, the alien is also a wizard, who could very easily be the cause of the outbreak of sex addiction in our country.	['sex']
SWAT Officer 3	5	0	Mr. President, here they are.	[]
Therapist	12	0	This is the boy I told you about. And his friend, Bummers.	[]
Chairman	20	1	Son, we were told that you think sex addiction can be controlled. That it just takes restraint. Is that true?	['sex']
Kyle	14	0	I just think I'd rather... control it instead of blame it on anything.	[]
Chairman	20	1	A-mazing. Then the wizard alien spell might not have any power over him! He could draw the bastard out!	['bastard']
Obama	6	0	Quick, give that boy a gun!	[]
Kyle	1	0	What?	[]
SWAT Officer 3	6	0	You'd better take one too.	[]
Obama	11	1	Alright, everyone to the stairwell. The bastard's gotta be upstairs.	['bastard']
Kyle	2	1	What bastard?	['bastard']
Obama	12	0	The alien wizard hiding out here! Come on, we've got tuh-	[]
Chairman	4	1	The hell was that?	['hell']
SWAT Officer 4	7	0	I got a baaad feelin' about this.	[]
Dr. Tonton	6	0	Oh my God there it is!	[]
Chairman	13	0	It's the alien wizard! It's gonna get you boys! Shoot it!	[]
Obama	3	0	Shoot it boys!	[]
Expert 6	5	0	You have to shoot it!	[]
Chairman	7	0	Shoot it again, it's still alive!	[]
SWAT Officer 5	3	0	You gotta reload!	[]
Expert 4	8	0	Keep firing, boys! Shoot it in the heart!	[]
Obama	3	0	Keep shooting it!	[]
Expert 11	6	0	Shoot him in his blabber mouth!	[]
Chairman	6	0	My God, they've done it!	[]
Bill Clinton	9	1	Look! The sex addiction! It's leavin' my body!	['sex']
David Letterman	7	0	I can feel it! I'm free!	[]
Another addict	3	0	We are healed!	[]
Obama	71	2	We watched... as sex addiction ran rampant through our country. It devastated families. But once again, our great country has risen up as one. The wizard alien... is dead. Sex addiction is no more. And if a rich celebrity is caught again trying to screw lots of women, we will know it isn't because men are just like that, it's because a wizard alien has cast his mighty spell.	['sex', 'sex']
Randy	12	0	Oh I'm so glad it's over, Sharon. Aren't you?	[]
News 4 Reporter	23	0	We are now with the young boys who helped stop the alien. Boys, how does it feel to be free of your illness?	[]
Kyle	6	0	I guess it... feels great. Thanks.	[]
Butters	35	0	Yeah, it feels great! I never wanna see bush again!  I finally paid a lady to show me hers. You wanna know what's under that bush? Nothin' but a pair of sick Joker lips.	[]
Tiger	54	1	I am so happy that I am cured, and no longer have any desire to have sex with anyone but my beautiful wife. Now I can be faithful. And my wife won't feel any need to get revenge by sleeping with a bunch of guys.  So I officially announce my return to golf.	['sex']
Cartman	9	1	What the hell?! This game's all boring now!	['hell']
Stan	6	0	Yeah, where's all the fighting?	[]
Cartman	12	0	Dude, screw this!  Who wants to hit a dumb little ball around?!	[]
Stan	5	0	Yeah, golf is stupid again.	[]
