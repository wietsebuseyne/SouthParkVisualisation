Clerk	16	0	Nnnyeah, no problem, though. We'll get you on the 7 a.m. flight tomorrow morning.	[]
Mr. Garrison	9	1	I can't go tomorrow, the Jizzfest is tonight!	['jizzfest']
Clerk	9	0	Would you like a window or an aisle seat?	[]
Mr. Garrison	23	0	This is unbelievable! You know, I seem to remember when the airlines said, We need a 15 billion dollar bailout from the taxpayers-!	[]
Clerk	16	0	Mmokay, and have any of your personal items been out of your possession since you left?	[]
Mr. Garrison	25	0	Well we gave them the 15 billion dollar bailout and they fired their employees anyway! So now we have three people to clear 400 passengers!	[]
Man	4	0	Hey, he's right!	[]
People	1	0	YEAH!	[]
Clerk	10	0	Okay, and bags have been with you at all times?	[]
Mr. Garrison	34	0	So where did that money go? I'll tell you where it went: it went into the pockets of the presidents and CEOs of the airlines, so they can keep their multimillion dollar salaries!	[]
People	1	0	YEAH!	[]

Mr. Garrison	47	1	You think you can treat us however you want because we HAVE to fly! Well I'll tell you what, Sally Sassalot, I'm gonna come up with a NEW mode of transportation! A ahah brand new vehicle that'll put all you bastards out of business!	['bastards']

People	1	0	YEAH!	[]
Man	10	0	Can I get on that 7:30 a.m. flight?	[]
Sheila	10	0	Here we go, Kyle Two.  And here's yours, Kyle.	[]

Kyle	5	0	Oh is, is this beef?	[]
Kyle Two	5	0	Yeah, dude, it's great!	[]
Kyle	24	1	Uha, wa, actually, I- I can't eat beef. I have a degenerative problem with my intestinal lining, and beef really gives me gaass.	['gaass']
Sheila	12	0	Oh, I'm so sorry, Kyle. What else can I fix you?	[]
Kyle	14	0	Oh no, I d- I don't want to be a bother, I uh-	[]
Sheila	14	0	Nonsense. Can't I make you some nice pasta? Or a frozen fish fillet?	[]
Kyle	14	0	We-ull, some fish would be great if it isn't too much trouble.	[]
Sheila	9	0	I'll put it in the microwave right away.	[]
Kyle Two	1	0	Mom?	[]
Sheila	3	0	Yes, Kyle Two?	[]
Kyle Two	7	0	How am I related to him again?	[]
Sheila	10	0	He's your cousin, Kyle Two. I told you already.	[]
Kyle Two	8	0	Yeah, but like... first cousin or distant cousin?	[]
Sheila	12	0	He's my sister's son. That makes him your first cousin.	[]
Kyle Two	6	0	So we have the same blood?	[]
Sheila	46	0	Now Kyle Two, listen to me. Kyle is going through a very tough time in his life. His mother is very sick and he's in a whole new place. He's going to rely on you to make sure he fits in at your school.	[]
Kyle Two	10	1	What? How the hell am I supposed to do that?	['hell']
Sheila	8	0	I'm sure your friends will love him.	[]
Kyle Two	18	1	What about Cartman, huh? He rips on me for being Jewish! He's gonna tear this kid apart!	['jewish']
Sheila	6	0	Kyle Two, he's your responsibility.	[]
Kyle Two	3	0	Oh my God.	[]
Sheila	16	0	I'm sure you two will become great friends with lots of late night pillow talk.	[]
Kyle Two	11	0	Well what do you mean?  What room is he sleeping in?	[]
Kyle	15	0	What's this comforter filled with? Um, it isn't filled with down, is it?	[]
Kyle Two	5	0	I don't know, dude.	[]
Kyle	21	0	Ih it sure is quiet up here in the mountains and it's dry, too. Do you have a humidi-humidifier?	[]
Kyle Two	5	0	I don't think so.	[]
Kyle	41	0	Uh, can you take my stupid glasses and put them on the night stand. Make sure they're close by, because that fish upset my stomach and I might need them if I have to go to he bathroom later on.	[]
Kyle Two	1	0	Okay.	[]
Mr. Garrison	37	0	Now it's got to be simple. Like a moped, but with the ability to travel at much faster speeds. The designs of our electrical moped were altered with a- no, nonono this won't work either!	[]
Mr. Hat	6	0	What was wrong with that plan?	[]
Mr. Garrison	35	1	It has to be more stable, Mr. Hat! A moped would be too dangerous at those speeds. Damnit!  Now, what if the jet power of an aircraft could be scaled down into a personal vehicle?	['damnit']
Mr. Hat	11	1	Boy, that Enrique Iglesias can sure gyrate his hot ass around.	['ass']
Enrique Iglesias	11	0	...I think about you day and night. I think about you...	[]
Mr. Garrison	18	0	Oh, Mr. Hat! Would you stop drooling over Enrique Iglesias and... wait a minute. What did you say?	[]
Mr. Hat	10	1	I said Enrique Iglesias can sure gyrate his hot ass!	['ass']
Mr. Garrison	27	0	That's it. Gyration.  A gyroscope.  It would allow for maximum balance and yet... Mr. Hat! You're a genius!  It's so simple and yet genius!	[]
Mr. Hat	6	0	Check out his hot bulge, too.	[]
Stan	2	0	Hey dude.	[]
Cartman	4	0	What's that thing?	[]
Kyle Two	7	0	Cartman, I need to talk to you.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Hello, I'm Kyle's cousin Kyle.	[]
Kyle Two	8	0	Cartman, I'm gonna make you a deal.	[]
Cartman	1	0	What?	[]
Kyle Two	34	0	That kid over there is my cousin from the East Coast. He's having a really hard time right now, so I'm going to offer you forty dollars to not rip on him.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Forty bucks?	[]
Kyle Two	14	1	But you can't make fun of him AT ALL. No smartass comments, nothin'.	['smartass']
Cartman	2	0	Alright, alright.	[]
Kyle Two	9	1	And you especially can't say anything about Jews!	['jews']
Cartman	11	1	Aw, Jesus, why don't you just cut off my balls?	['balls']
Kyle Two	24	1	Cartman, no Jew jokes! All you have to do is keep your mouth shut, and you've got forty bucks! Can you do it?	['jew']
Kyle	10	0	I can't believe how cold it is out here.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Could be tough. But I'll give it a shot.	[]
Kyle Two	1	0	Alright.	[]
Kyle	17	0	It's a really dry cold; that's the problem. It- the cold air makes me wheeze.	[]
Kyle Two	9	0	Kyle, this is Cartman, my sort of... friend-ish.	[]
Kyle	40	0	Ot- Nice to meet you, Cartman. Yuh you know, I saw that same jacket you're wearing at Bosco's for $29.95. How much was yours? Um, I juh- I was just wondering if Bosco's is a ripoff?	[]
Cartman	2	0	...Oh, man.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Cartman?!	[]
Cartman	22	0	Uh, it's nice to meet you, Kyle. I can certainly tell you're a relative of my good friend Kyle here.	[]
Stan	5	1	What the hell was that?	['hell']
Officer Barbrady	6	1	Uh what the hell was that?	['hell']
Stuart	5	1	What the hell was that?	['hell']
Randy	16	0	I dunno, it was going so fast I couldn't see it.  But I want one.	[]
Stuart	3	0	Yep, me too.	[]
Mr. Garrison	31	1	We've done it, Mr. Hat. Airline companies be damned. We've invented a whole new mode of transportation! Get some investors on the phone!  Well what are you waiting for?!	['damned']
Ms. Choksondik	24	0	And I know you'll all be very nice to our new student.  Kyle, why don't you tell us a little about yourself?	[]
Kyle	60	2	Oh well, I I grew up in the shity, ah ah I really don't care for it. Ah I come from a Jewish family, which of course you already know, because Kyle's from the same family.  I like to read, and I have these polyps on the backs of my hands - I don't know what they are.	['shity', 'jewish']
Cartman	13	0	Ohmigod, I'm not gonna make it. I'm not gonna make it.	[]
Kyle	11	0	...Oh, and I hope one day to be an investment banker.	[]
Cartman	7	0	I... must.. fight it! Need... forty... dollars!	[]
Ms. Choksondik	12	0	Okay, why don't you go ahead and take a seat, Kyle?	[]
Kyle	13	0	Uh where should I sit? There's no place to sit down here.	[]
Ms. Choksondik	22	0	Yes, unfortunately the school seems to be completely out of extra desks. So you'll just have to share with your cousin.	[]
Kyle Two	1	0	What?	[]
Kyle	3	0	Eh, oh, alright.	[]
Ms. Choksondik	10	0	Now let's get on with our lesson on the-	[]
Kyle	20	0	Ah-ah-ah-are wooden desks all that available? I usually prefer the plastic ones because these give me splinters.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Ugh, ugh!	[]
Ms. Choksondik	19	0	I'm sorry, Kyle. You'll just have to make do.  Now let's get back to the le-	[]
Kyle	20	0	Is it cold in here? I realize we're in the mountains, but do we have to freeze to death?	[]
Ms. Choksondik	18	0	Now Kyle, I need you to be quiet. In my class you need to be able to concentrate.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Oh!	[]
Ms. Choksondik	9	0	Concentration is the key to succeeding in my class.	[]
Cartman	14	3	Maybe we'll have to send him to concentration camp. AWGH! Damnit, damnit, damnit!	['damnit', 'damnit', 'damnit']
Kyle Two	1	0	CARTMAN!	[]
Anchor	57	0	Kindergarten teacher Herbert Garrison has apparently invented a new vehicle that will give the airlines a run for their money. Mr. Garrison is putting the final touches on his top secret device, which he simply calls IT.  So what exactly is IT?  Here with a report is a Hispanic man with some gravy stains on his lapel.	[]
Hispanic Reporter	118	0	Thanks, Tom, I-oh...  Thanks, Tom. So far, Herbert Garrison hasn't let anyone get a look at his invention. He claims that the vehicle is sooo genius and revolutionary that it could cause one's eyes to bleed if not properly prepared to see it. But earlier today HBC News got footage of some of the country's top investors and richest people who have been invited for a first look, including: Steve Forbes , Steve Jobs , Ted Turner , Donald Trump , Bill Gates , and Yasmine Bleeth . Their curiosity is piqued, Tom, and so is ours. What is IT? What does ITdo? And when will IT be somewhere where I can buy one? Reporting live, Jeff Arrando , HBC News.	[]
Kyle Two	34	0	You need to learn to play some sports, Kyle. So we're gonna start with a tough one called, Catch the Ball. I throw the football to you; you throw it back to me.	[]
Kyle	20	0	Oh, bu- but isn't the cold air making the ball really hard? Ih-it's gonna hurt my hands.	[]
Kyle Two	3	0	It's fine!	[]
Kyle	8	0	Alright then, hu-how do I catch it?	[]
Kyle Two	19	0	Ih it's a football, dude. You just- put your arms out and catch it.  Alright, here we go.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Now what?	[]
Kyle Two	6	0	Now throw it back to me.	[]
Kyle	7	0	But it's down in the snow.	[]
Kyle Two	4	0	...So dig it out.	[]
Kyle	19	0	But I'll get snow on my gloves and then it will melt and I'll have wet hands.	[]
Kyle Two	7	0	...Well, then we'll dry them off!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Alright, then.	[]
Kyle Two	3	0	Oh my God.	[]
Cartman	19	1	Kyle, Kyle!  I just found out that in World War II, some Jewish people were sent to concentration camps.	['jewish']
Kyle Two	4	0	Yeah! They WERE, Cartman!	[]
Cartman	33	1	Oh, and see, I didn't realize that. But I understand now how you might've felt what I said in the classroom was a racial slut. But see, I had no idea.	['slut']
Kyle Two	9	1	You did, too! You are so full of crap!	['crap']
Cartman	99	0	No, I'm seriously! Because, um, I was, I was talkin' to Craig, and Craig was all like, Hey, did you know that in World War II they really HAD concentration camps? And I was all like, No way! And this little light went on in my head like, Aw man, no wonder Kyle thought what I said in the class, seemed like it was directed at his cousin. But, but I was literally talkin' about a concentration camp, you know, where you go for a week to learn and focus, you know. Oh, mahan.  What a misunderstanding, huh?	[]
Kyle Two	5	0	You blew the deal, Cartman!	[]
Cartman	5	1	Goddamnit, give me another chance!	['goddamnit']
Kyle Two	32	0	Nuh-uh, I knew you were gonna make fun of my lame cousin, so I paid you the forty bucks NOT to rip on him! You ripped on him, deal's off!	[]
Kyle	4	0	Uh you did what?	[]
Kyle Two	2	0	Oh no.	[]
Cartman	5	1	Haha,  serves you right, asshole.	['asshole']
Kyle	11	0	You, you paid your friends tuh...  not make fun of me?	[]
Kyle Two	11	0	Look, ih it's not because anything's wrong with you.	[]
Kyle	14	0	Wow uh, you think it takes forty dollars to get people to like me.	[]
Kyle Two	6	0	Kyle, I-eh I'm sorry.	[]
Kyle	17	0	Because I m-I mean I really think you could have done it for about $12.50.	[]
Kyle Two	1	0	What?	[]
Kyle	25	0	Well, I mean, you didn't just start at 40, didja? You you gotta low-ball these things so you have a place to go.	[]
Kyle Two	6	0	Uh-uh-uh oh, dude. Uh	[]
Kyle	7	0	Boy it sure is dry out here.	[]
Mr. Garrison	21	1	Gentlemen, imagine being able to travel safely at incredibly fast speeds, and not having to go to the stupid fartface airports!	['fartface']
Mr. Hat	5	0	That sounds incredible, Mr. Garrison.	[]
Mr. Garrison	21	0	It IS incredible, Mr. Hat. And what makes IT possible  is IT's patented gyroscope design.  Gentlemen, I give you, IT!	[]
Guests	1	0	Whoa.	[]
Steve Forbes	1	0	Nice.	[]
Donald Trump	1	0	Sweet.	[]
Mr. Garrison	20	0	IT gets over 300 miles to the gallon, and is safely capable of speeds of over 200 miles per hour.	[]
Guests	2	0	Whoa. Wow.	[]
Bill Gates	4	0	This will change everything.	[]
Steve Jobs	8	0	We're going to have to rethink cities!	[]
Mr. Garrison	39	1	Now, IT is easily operated using four flexigrip handles. Two of them are on each side. Left side for throttle, right side for steering.  The third flexigrip is gently inserted into the anus, to keep the driver in place.	['anus']
Guests	2	0	Ugh. Oh.	[]
Mr. Garrison	37	0	...there we go. Now, the final flexigrip is directly in front of the driver so that its small switches can be operated with the mouth, as such.  Put the four together and we're ready to go.	[]
Steve Jobs	3	0	Oh my God!	[]
Steve Forbes	4	0	Look at it go!	[]
Bill Gates	15	0	But the way it works... do you think people will go through that to travel?	[]
Steve Forbes	11	0	Hey, it... still beats what you go through at the airports.	[]
Guest 1	1	0	True.	[]
Guest 2	1	0	Yup.	[]
Guest 3	4	0	Yeah, that's true.	[]
Guest 4	1	0	Yeap.	[]
Kyle Two	21	0	I can't take it anymore, Stan. My cousin's been here for two weeks and he's driving me insane.	[]
Stan	12	1	I know, dude. Every kid in school wants to kick his ass.	['ass']
Kyle Two	64	3	I spent five years in this town making a good name for Jews and this... this... stereotype shows up and wrecks it all! You know what my biggest fear is? That I'll become him. That somehow his mannerisms will start rubbing off on me, and I'll become a stereotype. I mean, I'm a Jew and he's making me hate Jews.	['jews', 'jew', 'jews']
Stan	10	1	Dude, a self-hating Jew? You are becoming a stereotype.	['jew']
Kyle Two	2	0	Ya see?	[]
Kyle	4	0	I'm ba-ack!	[]
Kyle Two	1	0	Ugh.	[]
Stan	3	0	Book. Later, dude.	[]
Jeff Arrando	21	0	Tom, the day is finally here. IT has arrived for retail sale, and people are getting their first look at it.	[]
Mr. Garrison	17	0	Okay, good. Just step through here  And then this is your steering and here's your throttle.	[]
Craig's father	1	0	Okay.	[]
Mr. Garrison	10	0	Okay, now you're just gonna feel a little pinch.	[]
Craig's father	1	0	HAAAOW!	[]
Mr. Garrison	43	0	It's alright, it's just locking you in.  You can take it.  Doing great, Kathy. How's that ride?  Okay, now use your mouth to operate the turn signals, and you're off.  Great! Who else wants to give it a spin?	[]
Randy	6	0	Oh, man, it that the IT?	[]
Craig's Father	1	0	Hehyeah.	[]
Stuart	3	0	How is it?	[]
Craig's Father	15	0	Well, ugh. Ih ih it beats dealing with the airline companies, that's for sure.	[]
Kyle	12	0	I don't know about this, guys. I think sleds are dangerous.	[]
Kyle Two	14	0	Look, Kyle. Sledding is something all kids out here do. You've gotta learn.	[]
Kyle	8	0	It seems like I might get splinters, though.	[]
Kyle Two	14	0	Remember: Just hold on. No matter how long the sledding run lasts, hold on.	[]
Kyle	11	0	Hold on. I see.  Oh, Jeezus, this sled is going faaaast.	[]
Kyle Two	2	0	Hang on!	[]
Kyle	16	0	I have to watch out for my glasses. Ow! Ow, it's so cold! Oh Jesus!	[]
Kyle Two	9	0	How far do you think it is to Connecticut?	[]
Kyle	8	0	It's a least a couple of hours.	[]
Kyle Two	5	0	Think he'll be alright?	[]
Cartman	3	0	He's faaahn.	[]
Announcer	74	0	Are you tired of corporate airline companies treating you like a worthless sardine?  Tired of ridiculous lines and horrible security at airports?  Well, now there is an alternative to airline travel.  IT.  IT has taken the country by storm.  And already two million have been sold.  Never have another important business trip ruined by airline incompetence.  Hey ladies! How did you get to the Grand Canyon?  IT comes in sizes for the entire family.	[]
Woman	4	0	Here you go, Robby.	[]
John Travolta	53	0	Hello, I'm John Travolta. I used to rely on airlines to get me to set, but once I got used to IT,  I found it to be a little less painful than dealing with the airline companies. I just power up the flexigrips.  And I'm ready to go. Thank you, IT.	[]
Announcer	27	0	So join the millions of Americans who have felt a little more comfortable with... traveling.  Order yours today and remember our slogan: IT's better than flying.	[]
Kyle Two	5	1	...Hm, that was pretty gay.	['gay']
Sheila	5	0	Kyle Two, where is Kyle?	[]
Kyle Two	13	0	I don't know, Mom. Last time I saw him he was sledding.	[]
Sheila	6	0	Where on earth could he be?	[]
Kyle Two	11	0	You know, it's just possible he went back to Connecticut.	[]
Sheila	1	0	What?	[]
Kyle Two	22	0	Well, ah I mean, maybe he got so worried about his mom that found a way to get back and see her.	[]
Sheila	14	0	Don't be ridiculous, Kyle Two. He's out playing with his new friends.	[]
Kyle Two	10	0	I'm just throwin' it out there as a possibility.	[]
Kyle	4	0	I'm ba-ack.	[]
Kyle Two	1	0	AAA!	[]
Kyle	18	0	I'm sorry. You must've been worried sick. I got your sled tangled up with a bus.	[]
Kyle Two	5	0	A, a bus. R-really?	[]
Sheila	5	0	Kyle, what happened to you??	[]
Kyle	42	0	Ah- I was just sledding, and the next thing I knew my sled rope got tangled with a bus, uh. I gut dragged for over a hundred miles before the bus finally stopped for gas.  I'm sorry about your sled, Kyle.	[]
Kyle Two	8	0	Oh no- don't worry about it, dude.	[]
Sheila	19	0	Oh you poor thing! Come upstairs and we'll get you out of those wet clothes.  Are you alright?	[]
Kyle	24	0	Oh, my ears feel like they're frozen off, and I think I have a hemorrhoid from sitting on the sled for so long.	[]
Mr. Garrison	21	0	We're in the money, Mr. Hat, We're in the money, Mr. Hat...  Oh hi, Jimbo. Can I help you?	[]
Jimbo	11	0	Yeah, I wanted to order that theft alarm for my IT.	[]
Mr. Garrison	6	0	Oh, right, right. Take a seat.	[]
Jimbo	7	0	Uh, that's okay, I'll stand.	[]
Mr. Garrison	16	0	What do you think, Mr. Marsh? All set to put a down payment on that baby?	[]
Randy	12	0	Well, yeah, but I have one question about the way it works.	[]
Mr. Garrison	1	0	Sure.	[]
Randy	21	0	Well,  it seems all the buttons on these front and rear flexigrips are also found on the side of the vehicle.	[]
Mr. Garrison	1	0	Yeup.	[]
Randy	8	0	Well... so... they don't really... do anything.	[]
Mr. Garrison	1	0	Right.	[]
Randy	20	1	So then, couldn't I just order one that works without going in and out of my ass and mouth?	['ass']
Mr. Garrison	5	0	Well, I... guess you could.	[]
Man 1	1	0	Huh?	[]
Man 2	1	0	Whazzat?	[]
Man 3	8	0	Wha- what did you- what did he say?	[]
Man 4	1	0	What?	[]
Kyle	19	0	I don't know about this guys. I think playing hide and seek in the airport might be dangerous.	[]
Kyle Two	15	0	Kyle, we told you: Kids in Colorado all play hide and seek at the airport.	[]
Stan	16	0	Yeah, as soon as we get to the concourse you'll see how fun it is.	[]
Kyle Two	21	0	Ungh, this is taking too long. The flight to Connecticut is about to leave.  Ey! Can we speed things up here??	[]
Security Guard	19	0	Daaah, sorry, but ever since that IT thing came out the airlines have had to cut back on employees.	[]
Kyle Two	16	0	Dude, we're the only ones here! How long does it take five people through security?!	[]
Security Guard	15	0	Derr, let's see: Twelve people... plus... times... divided... two hours domestic, three hours international.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Can't we just play hide and seek at home?	[]
Kyle Two	1	0	No!	[]
Security Guard	10	0	Dah ha! What's this?! A toenail clipper!  Die, terrorist!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Oh, Jesus!!	[]
Security Guard	8	0	See, we do these checks for a reason!	[]

Cartman	4	0	1, 2, 3, 4...	[]
Kyle Two	7	0	Here, Kyle. You go hide in here.	[]
