Mr. Garrison	23	0	Kids, everyone together. Welcome to Pioneer Village. This is a recreation of early Colorado days. I want you all to meet Pioneer Paul.	[]
Pioneer Paul	43	0	Hi, kids, and welcome to my village. I settled here in 1864 with my mahr and pahr. Sure thing, I ain't never seen strange clothes like you all are wearin'. And what's that fancy yellow horse carriage you got out there?	[]
Stan	1	0	Ughh.	[]
Kyle	4	0	This is gonna suck.	[]
Pioneer Paul	27	0	When you all are ready just head up to the village. All the townfolk are there to answer yer questions. And welcome.  To 1864. Set 'em up!	[]
Mr. Garrison	24	0	Thank you, Pioneer Paul.  All right, kids, this is a big place, so I want everyone to pick a partner to hold hands with.	[]

Cartman	3	1	God damn it!	['damn']
Mr. Garrison	4	0	Hold Butters' hand, Eric!	[]
Cartman	4	0	That isn't necessary!	[]
Mr. Garrison	22	0	Butters, you are not to let go of Eric's hand until you are both back on that bus! Do you understand?!	[]
Butters	2	0	I understand.	[]
Mr. Garrison	6	0	All right, let's head in.	[]
Cartman	6	0	You can let go now, Butters.	[]
Butters	1	0	No.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Butters, come on!	[]
Butters	1	0	No!	[]
Mr. Garrison	18	0	All right kids, go ahead and visit the charming villagers and learn stuff.  Keep track of your partner!	[]
Smithy	19	0	Why howdy partners.  I'm the town blacksmith. Are you folks settlers, or are you just trappers passin' through?	[]
Stan	33	0	Uhhh, look, can we just drop the whole roleplaying thing? I would play along, but my girlfriend's here and I don't wanna look like a total dork in front of her.	[]
Wendy	2	0	Thanks, Stan.	[]
Pioneer Paul	21	0	These folks sure are strange, Smithy. We ain't never seen them kind of fancy hats in our time, have we?	[]
Kyle	7	0	That guy is wearing a digital watch.	[]
Smithy	2	0	Oh jeez.	[]
Pioneer Paul	3	1	Damn it Chad!	['damn']
Chad	5	0	S-sorry, I'm sorry.	[]
Gunsmith	36	0	Why howdy, partners, I'm the town gunsmith. You see, in our time it's pretty violent. See them holes in the walls? That's so we can put rifles through to protect us from Injuns.	[]
Cartman	5	0	I wanna shoot an Indian.	[]
Gunsmith	22	0	Now some of you might wanna meet Abigail at the candle-makin' house. Or you can head over to the general store.	[]
Butters	5	0	Do you see any Indians?	[]
Cartman	39	1	Nah, it's just the city and e- Oh my Jesus Christ monkeyballs.  Super... Phun Thyme.  Dude, check it out! We're only two blocks from a Super Phun Thyme! They've got video games and rides and everything!	['monkeyballs']
Butters	15	0	Oh, that's cool.  Well come on, Eric, we need to catch up with everyone.	[]
Cartman	12	0	Dude, screw this place! We've gotta go to Super Phun Thyme!	[]
Butters	12	0	Oh no! I'm not sneakin' out! I'll get in trouble!	[]
Cartman	7	0	Fine, then let go of my hand!	[]
Butters	14	0	Teacher said I can't let go till we're back on the bus!	[]
Cartman	24	0	Well which is it gonna be, Butters?! Are you gonna ditch out with me or are you gonna disobey the teacher's stupid rule?!	[]
Butters	5	0	I'm not lettin' go!	[]
Cartman	7	0	Fine, then you're comin' with me!	[]
Butters	2	0	No, Eric!	[]
Cartman	6	1	Butters, let go God-damn it!	['damn']
Butters	4	0	No!  T-Teacherrr! Teacherrr!	[]
Pioneer Paul	16	0	This here is our general store. It's where I buy all my supplies an' sich.	[]
Clerk	8	0	Howdy partners. I own this hearrr general store.	[]
Wendy	8	0	Look, Stan, they had beef jerky back then.	[]
Clerk	12	0	What do you mean back then? Don't forget, it's 1864.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Right. Except for it really isn't.	[]
Pioneer Paul	8	0	Wuh, sure it is. Just look around ye.	[]
Kyle	3	0	What's that?	[]
Stan	4	0	Sounds like police sirens.	[]
Pioneer Paul	15	0	What's a si-rene? We ain't never heard of no sirene in 1864.	[]
Leader	6	0	We lost them, we lost them!	[]
Injured Man	3	1	Damn pig cops!	['damn']
Leader	3	0	Close that gate!	[]
Wendy	4	0	What's going on?	[]
Stan	4	0	I don't know.	[]
Leader	6	0	Everyone down on the ground NOW!	[]
Sheriff	14	0	Wuh-whoa now, I'm Sheriff McLawdog. I settled here back in eighteen fif-	[]
Stan	12	0	Jesus Christ!  We've gotta call the police. Where's your phone?	[]
Pioneer Paul	15	0	A phone? Why, what's a phone? We ain't never hearda sich a thing.	[]
Stan	1	0	What?!	[]
Kyle	5	0	Come on, this is serious!	[]
Pioneer Paul	10	0	Eh storehand, you ever heard of this fancy shmancy phone?	[]
Clerk	12	0	Uhhh, nooo. W-we ain't got a phone in our time.	[]
Stan	15	0	Dude, they just shot a guy in the face! We've gotta call the cops!	[]
Pioneer Paul	27	0	If you mean the law, only law around here is town sheriff McLawdog. You see, 1864 is a time of growth and development in the Old West.	[]
Stan	7	0	This is not the time for that!	[]
Cartman	25	1	Aw man, this is gonna be awesome!  Butters, if you don't let go of my hand, everyone here is gonna think we're gay!	['gay']
Butters	5	0	Well, that's your problem!	[]
Cartman	12	0	All right Butters, I've seriously had enough!  Jesus Christ!  One please.	[]
Butters	3	0	Make that two!	[]
Cashier	13	0	Aww, aren't you two cute holdin' hands. Are you special little buddies?	[]
"Butters, Cartman"	1	0	NO!	[]
Cartman	9	0	Dude, this place shreds! What should we do first?	[]
Butters	13	0	We should get back to Pioneer Village, that's what we should do!	[]
Cartman	21	0	Butters, we're going to get back before anybody even notices we're gone. Let's go hit the bumper cars!	[]
Wendy	7	0	Over here. This looks like an office.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Here! Here's the phone!	[]
Pioneer Paul	5	0	Well, what a straaange contraption.	[]
Wendy	7	0	I can't get a dial tone.	[]
Kyle	7	0	What's the number to dial out?	[]
Pioneer Paul	11	0	Dial out? Partner, them are some funny words you're usin'.	[]
Stan	9	0	Dude, do you understand what's going on here?!	[]
Clerk	13	0	Maybe they're right, Brian. I mean, this is a special circumstance that-	[]
Pioneer Paul	1	0	Brresh!	[]
Clerk	21	0	Ogh, I mean, this here room is, it sure is strange. We have nothin' like these fancy devices in our time.	[]
Pioneer Paul	3	0	I'll say.	[]
Kyle	5	0	I got through. Hello, police?	[]
Operator	7	0	Nine one one, what's your emergency?	[]
Kyle	14	0	There's some terrorists or bankrobbers or something that have taken our class hostage!	[]
Operator	3	0	Taken hostage where?	[]
Kyle	7	0	The old Pioneer Village off of Kipling.	[]
Operator	11	0	You mean that annoying place where employees won't break character?	[]
Kyle	9	0	Sister, you don't know the half of it.	[]
Cartman	12	0	Check it out, dude, I'm a space man! Space man, yehesss!	[]
Cartman	17	0	Get... get that guy! Shoot that guy! Yeah, and then over here!  Oh, you got it. Nice.	[]
Butters	5	0	What are you whoofelin' at?	[]
Cartman	8	0	Waiwait, keep- you're fine.  Oh man, whoa!	[]
Butters	1	0	Whoa!	[]
Cartman	5	0	Yeheah, we're wired up!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Yeah, bumper cars, sweeet!	[]
Butters	11	0	Th-that's it, Eric. We have to be gettin' back!	[]
Cartman	6	0	Aw, just a few more things.	[]
Butters	21	0	No! If we don't leave right now, we're gonna miss the bus, and then they'll know we left!	[]
Cartman	11	0	Huh, I guess you're right, Butters. All right, come on.	[]
Leader	58	0	Set up the satellite relay, check for alternate routes out of the area.  Unfortunately, your police department got wind of our robbery and chased after us. That is unfortunate for you, because when I think it is clear to leave we will now need to take hostages with us to ensure our goods get to their final destination.	[]
Mr. Garrison	17	0	Please, if you must take anyone, don't take me. These kids are worth more to you.	[]
Blond	5	0	How did they find us?!	[]
Leader	13	0	Get the loot out of the car and stash it in that building.	[]
Police Chief	26	0	All right, men, listen up! Looks like our thieves are trying to hide out here. They've got the employees and some school kids held hostage.	[]
Lieutenant	6	0	Tucker, Dylan, set up a perimeter!	[]
Police Chief	13	0	Everyone stay on your toes! These are professionals we're dealing with here!	[]
Officer	5	0	What did they rob, sir?	[]
Police Chief	3	0	A Burger King.	[]
Leader	8	0	All right, good. Is that all of it?	[]
Balding Man	9	0	No. Don't forget we've got these too.	[]
Leader	57	0	Excellent. Now listen, everyone, we're going to be all right. This is only a small hitch in our plan.  I'd like to speak with the chief of police!  Who is this? This is the man who is going to kill an entire class of fourth graders if he doesn't get exactly what he wants!	[]
Kyle	7	0	Why aren't the cops coming in?	[]
Wendy	4	0	They must be negotiating.	[]
Pioneer Paul	18	0	Them there bandits sure look mighty strange. And them pistols is way bigger than whats we's gots.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Will you shut up!	[]
Stan	5	0	Wait, you have guns here?	[]
Pioneer Paul	9	0	Sure. Sheriff got lots of rifles in his office.	[]
Stan	13	0	Well why don't you go get them and bring them back here?!	[]
Pioneer Paul	5	0	All righty. Come on, storehand.	[]
Clerk	1	0	Yeppir!	[]
Cartman	31	0	Uhaw man, I can't wait to see the look on Kyle's face when we tell him we had super fun time, while he was at the dumb Pioneer Village.	[]
Butters	22	0	We're not telling anybody! I don't wanna get in trouble! And I didn't have a super fun time anyways.	[]
Cartman	36	0	Butters, you've gotta learn to chill. Life goes by pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, and do whatever you want all the time, you could miss it.	[]
Butters	8	0	Yeah, well, I guess that's kinda true.	[]
Cartman	9	1	Uh oh.  Crap, they called the cops on us.	['crap']
Butters	5	0	What?! They called the cops?!	[]
Cartman	7	1	They must have realized we left. Damn.	['damn']
Butters	9	0	Oh my God, the police are looking for us!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Shhh! Butters!	[]
Butters	6	0	We're gonna get it now!	[]
Cartman	11	0	Butters Butters, calm down! I know a way out of this!	[]
Butters	6	0	You just got me busted forever!	[]
Cartman	6	0	Butters, l-listen to me, listen.	[]
Butters	1	0	No!	[]
Cartman	23	0	All we have to do is sneak back inside without the cops seeing us. Then we can say we were inside all along.	[]
Butters	11	0	You said they wouldn't notice we were gone. You promised.	[]
Cartman	21	0	If we sneak back inside, we can say we never left, all right?  All right, now let go of my hand.	[]
Butters	1	0	No.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Butters?	[]
Butters	19	0	Huh you made me break one rule, I'm not breaking the other! It's all I have now.	[]
Cartman	4	0	All right, come on!	[]
Leader	23	0	Keep the hostages from talking and search for holdouts. Everyone check in at two-minute intervals. I hope you have good news, Ohrlich.	[]
Ohrlich	22	0	The police have us completely surrounded on all sides. There's no way we're gettin' out above ground without being spotted.	[]
Leader	2	0	Above ground?	[]
Ohrlich	45	0	Look, I found this at the rear of the park. It's an old mine shaft,  but Pioneer Village was sued when a kid died in it, so they closed it down and protected it with a huge me'al door with a coded lock.	[]
Leader	17	0	So if we can get into the shaft we can tunnel our way around the police. Excellent.	[]
Ohrlich	12	0	One more thing, Frans: I want my share of the take now.	[]
Frans	10	0	What's the matter, Ohrlich? Lose your sense of trust?	[]
Ohrlich	27	0	I was just thinking maybe we get through that tunnel. Then you take the loot to Berlin and I never see you again. I want my cut.	[]
Frans	2	0	Very well.	[]
Frans	15	0	I'm going to ask you again, what is the door code to the tunnel?!	[]
Smithy	31	0	I told you, mister, what would I know about a door code? I'm just a simple blacksmith. With my trusty forge I makes all the metalworks for the village.  OW.	[]
Frans	25	0	You are an employee here, that means you are required to know the door code for fire code reasons,  Mister David Palmer of Colorado Springs!	[]
Smithy	31	0	Huh my name ain't Palmer, it's... Old Smithy. Hand we ain't never heard of no fire code, why, we gots to put fires out ourselves when the-  OW.	[]
Frans	12	0	That's it!  Tell me the code or you die!  One... two...	[]
Smithy	1	0	I...	[]
Frans	1	0	Yes?	[]
Smithy	16	0	I don't know nothin' about no fancy door code. I'm just a simple blacksmith.	[]
Craig	10	0	These Pioneer Village workers are really committed to their jobs.	[]
Worker	6	0	No. Please. Don't hurt me.	[]
Frans	11	0	Give us the code to that door and we can leave!	[]
Worker	19	0	I've never heard of sss-something called a door code.  Please, can't you ask some other way?	[]
Frans	16	0	I don't have time for your stupid game! Tell me, or you die right now!	[]
Worker	30	0	All right, all right! Look, it's just, it's just one of those... Jenkins home security locks. You press the top button and then, and then enter 5-2	[]
Pioneer Paul	31	0	What he meant to say, kids, is that we ain't never heard o'no fancy door code 'cause in our time, we gots to rely on wood locks and sich.	[]
Frans	8	2	God damn it you people are fucking insane!	['damn', 'fucking']
Kyle	5	0	I don't believe it.	[]
Frans	19	0	Domino,  Walsky! Find out if there are any employees or students wandering about! Bring them here or shoot them!	[]
Wendy	8	1	Oh crap, we've gotta hide. Come on!	['crap']
Jimmy	15	1	Yeah.  We've gotta geh- ...geh... get the hell ...outta here f- f-hast fast.	['hell']
Officer	4	0	Sector Bravo, no activity.	[]
Butters	8	0	Jeez, uh cops are looking for us everywhere.	[]
Cartman	41	0	Don't worry, they're not gonna find us 'til we're safely back inside.  Look, see that traffic signal down there?  If we can climb across that, we can jump to the tree branch, and then we're home free.	[]
Butters	3	0	That looks dangerous.	[]
Cartman	26	0	Not getting busted always is, Butters. Come on.  Good, that's good.  That's good, Good, all right then. Let's head across.  Go easy. Good.	[]
Butters	4	0	Oh gosh in heaven.	[]
Cartman	11	0	It's all right. You've got it, no problem-  OP.	[]
Butters	1	0	Whoa!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Save me!	[]
Butters	4	0	I'm gonna fall!	[]
Cartman	3	0	... Oh dude, laaame.	[]
Frans	9	0	Frohlich, check in. Have you found any other employees?	[]
Domino	3	0	We found somebody.	[]
Walsky	12	0	We found this guy in the jail of the sheriff's office.	[]
Pioneer Paul	5	0	You let out Murderin' Murphy?	[]
Murderin' Murphy	12	0	Y'are all gettin' it for puttin' me in that thar jail!	[]
Frans	9	0	Stop it! Stop your bad historical acting right now!	[]
Woman	13	0	Tarnation. Why'd you let Murderin' Murphy go? He's a bad man.	[]
Frans	21	1	I am the fucking bad man! Do you get that?! Knock it off and give me the mine shaft access code!	['fucking']
Pioneer Paul	18	0	You're just gonna have to kill us, mister, 'cause you ain't makin' no sense at all.	[]
Frans	17	0	I won't kill you if you don't tell me. I'll kill one of THEM!	[]
Mr. Garrison	10	0	Not me! Not me not me not me not me!	[]
Kenny	4	0	(What? Hey, let go.)	[]
Frans	8	0	Do you want to see a child die?!	[]
Kenny	12	0	(No they don't wanna see a child die! You guys! Uf.)	[]
Butters	26	0	I am so disappointed in myself. Teacher gave me a res-responsibility, and I was just supposed to look after my partner, and I blew it!	[]
Cartman	29	1	Don't be too hard on yourself, Butters. You can't help being a douchebag. Wait, Butters, look!  This is it! This is our chance! Swing over, Butters! Go!	['douchebag']
Butters	1	0	Huh...	[]
Cartman	7	0	Quick! Are you ready?! We gotta jump!	[]
Butters	4	0	Let's do it!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Ready? Go!	[]
Frans	19	0	What about you? Will you tell us the access code or do you want to see this kid die?!	[]
Woman	25	0	I'm sorry, I'm a woman and women in our time ain't allowed to know the carryin's on of the town proper.	[]
Frans	3	1	God damn it!	['damn']
Kyle	6	0	Dude, they're gonna kill Kenny!	[]
Stan	15	0	I can't let them do it.  I've got to make the ultimate sacrifice.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Stan?	[]
Wendy	5	0	Where are you going, Stan?	[]
Stan	9	0	Wendy, I have to do something. Please look away.	[]
Frans	15	0	All right, that does it!  On the count of three this child dies! One! Two!	[]
Kenny	6	1	(God damn it, someone help me!)	['damn']
Stan	22	0	Well howdy there, strangers.  Sorry to interrupt ye, but I done come from Pagosa Springs to buy me some wares an' sich..	[]
Pioneer Paul	3	0	Ohhh, welcome, partner.	[]
Frans	5	0	Wha-what are you doing?	[]
Stan	15	0	I heard you all had some difficulty with a criminal getsin' out of your jail.	[]
Pioneer Paul	13	0	That's right, Murderin' Murphy. He's crazy 'cause someone killed his pa.	[]
Murderin' Murphy	4	0	They killed my pahr!	[]
Stan	23	0	I reckon that maybe you could make a jail door that opened with numbers instead of keys. You know, like a biiiiig safe.	[]
Pioneer Paul	6	0	Y-y-yeah, I understand that.	[]
Clerk	7	0	Finally, a fella that talks some sense.	[]
Stan	27	0	If'n you all was to have such a giant safe, what would you villagers want the number to be to unlock that thar jail door shuckamuck?	[]
Pioneer Paul	19	0	Oh, well uh, I reckon the easiest number to remember for any big safe door lock would be... 1864.	[]
Clerk	9	0	Yup, 1864, 'cause that's the year it is.	[]
Frans	19	0	Eighteen sixty four. Ohrlich, we have the door code! Start packing up! We'll take the hostages with us!	[]
Mr. Garrison	9	0	No, you got your door code, let us go!	[]
Walsky	7	0	Copy that. What's the code, over.	[]
Cartman	25	0	Sweet, there's still cops looking for us in here. All right, follow my lead, Butters.  Hohoo man, hasn't this place been fascinating, Butters?	[]
Butters	4	0	Yeah, it sure has.	[]
Cartman	20	0	Oh, I just don't know what I liked better: the historical buildings and archifacts or the, or the uhhhm.	[]
Butters	8	0	Or the witty anecdotes of the townspeople, uh...	[]
Cartman	11	0	Witty anecdotes, yes, that's been ab- that's been awesome.	[]
Butters	5	0	Been a hoot all right!	[]
Walsky	6	0	Get your hands behind your head!	[]
Cartman	11	0	What'd we do? We've been here the whole time.	[]
Walsky	16	0	Shut up! Put your hands behind your head! Do it now!  Let go of each other!	[]
Butters	2	0	Huh uh.	[]
Walsky	5	0	Do what I tell you!	[]
Butters	14	0	Our teacher said we have to hold hands the whole time we're here!	[]
Walsky	17	0	Let go or else I'll put a bullet through your hands and make you let go!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Butters.	[]
Walsky	1	0	Now!	[]
Butters	1	0	No!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Jesus Christ!	[]
Butters	1	0	AAAAH!	[]
Cartman	1	0	AAAAH!	[]
Frans	12	0	Go! Go take care of it! I'll stay with the hostages!	[]
Stan	9	0	Hey, m-Murderin' Murphy, you see that there feller?	[]
Murderin' Murphy	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Stan	5	0	He done killed yer pahr.	[]
Murderin' Murphy	8	0	What?! Well I'll rip his head off!	[]
Officer 2	8	0	We've got a chance. Hostages are clear!	[]
Frans	4	0	They are coming in!	[]
Mr. Garrison	1	0	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!	[]
Officer 3	3	0	Whoa, no, no!	[]
Officer 2	7	0	Hostages are secure at the park entrance!	[]
Murderin' Murphy	6	0	I got you now, Pioneer Paul!	[]
Pioneer Paul	10	0	They shoulda never let you out of jail, Murderin' Murphy!	[]
Police Chief	6	1	Freeze, scumbag! It's all over!	['scumbag']
Woman	7	0	Murderin' Murphy's gonna kill Pioneer Paul!	[]
Officer 2	6	0	Stop right now! It's over!	[]
PA System	26	0	Howdy, partners. It's five o'clock. Pioneer Village is now closed for the day.  Head back to your wagons and have a safe trip home.	[]
Pioneer Paul	3	0	We made it!	[]
Murderin' Murphy	3	0	We made it!	[]
Woman 2	12	0	Oh God, I can't wait to get out of this dress.	[]
Murderin' Murphy	4	0	Whoa, that was great!	[]
Pioneer Paul	42	0	Uh, listen, if anyone still wants to know, the phone is in the administration building, you dial 9 to get out, and there's actually a back exit behind the horse troughs. Good night everybody, thanks for coming. We did it, guys!	[]
Gunsmith	11	0	Let's go to TGI Fridays and get some jalapeno poppers!	[]
Murderin' Murphy	5	0	Yeah, that'd be great!	[]
Man 1	2	0	All right!	[]
Man 2	5	0	Oh yeah, huh. Jalapeno poppers.	[]
Man 3	4	0	Let's go, huh.	[]
Wendy	17	0	Stan, you were really brave in there, but you did kind of sound like a big dork.	[]
Stan	2	0	I know.	[]
Police Chief	3	0	Come on you!	[]
Frans	5	0	You're hurting my arm!	[]
Police Chief	15	0	Too bad! You'll be going away for a long time. Was it worth it?	[]
Frans	68	0	In a way, it was. I might not have gotten away, but... at least I learned a lot about Pioneer life in the Old West. Those early settlers didn't have the modern conveniences we all take for granted today. To think how difficult it was back in those times to do somethin' as simple as washing your clothes. Pioneer Village has a lot to teach us all.	[]
Police Chief	3	0	That's true.	[]
Wendy	2	0	Hey look.	[]
Butters	8	0	Teacher, my partner is back on the bus!	[]
