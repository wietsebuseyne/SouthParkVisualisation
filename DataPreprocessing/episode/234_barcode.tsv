Cartman	2	0	FELLAS! Fellas!	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Cartman	12	0	You'll never guess what happened. Butters just beat up Scott Malkinson!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Butters?  Why?	[]
Cartman	46	0	It was crazy! Scott was just talking about how he needed to take his insulin shot, and out of nowhere Butters said he's sick of people with diabetes feeling sorry for themselves. Scott told Butters to shut up and Butters just started whaling on him!	[]
Stan	5	0	You're talking about Butters.	[]
Cartman	20	1	Dude, I'm telling you! Butters beat the crap out of Scott, and then he locked himself in the bathroom!	['crap']
Stan	1	0	Butters?	[]
Butters	3	0	Leave me alone!	[]
Stan	4	0	Butters, come out here.	[]
Butters	7	0	Get out of here, all of ya!	[]
Kyle	20	0	Butters, people can't just go around beating up people who have diabetes! Now whatever your problem is, you just-	[]
Butters	112	2	You just think you know everything, don't you Kyle?! Every little thing you gotta shoot your mouth off like you're the frickin' expert! Well you don't know everything because  your best friend is a kid who thinks the entire planet revolves around him and he only cares about HIS image!  You guys think Cartman is the only selfish piece of crap in this school? You're all fake and stuck up , and none of you have the courage to tell Jimmy that his jokes aren't funny!  The only kid here with any sense of dignity is Kenny, and the rest of you have your heads up your butts!	['crap', 'butts']
Cartman	13	0	Well. Apparently Kenny is Butters' best friend. You guys gonna make out, Kenny?	[]
Butters	27	0	And that's another thing! You're always trivializing everything I say by gettin' the last word! Well you're not gettin' the last word this time!	[]
Cartman	1	0	...Wow.	[]
Butters	2	0	Double wow!	[]
Principal Victoria	18	0	I'm sorry, but your son is distracting the other students and his attitude is just getting worse.	[]
Stephen	8	0	Butters, what on earth has gotten into you?!	[]
Butters	13	0	I don't know, Dad, ah I was just pissed off, I guess!	[]
Linda	12	0	Do you think this behavior is fair to your teacher and classmates?!	[]
Butters	13	0	I don't suppose it is, but I don't give a darn!	[]
Stephen	13	0	Do you have any idea how grounded you are about to be, mister?!	[]
Butters	17	0	Why don't you shut up, Dad, and stick it in your ear, for cryin' out loud!	[]
Linda	8	0	Stephen, are you thinking what I'm thinking?	[]
Stephen	13	0	Yes. Our little Butters is flowering. He has reached the age of panua.	[]
Principal Victoria	3	0	Eh-excuse me?	[]
Stephen	7	0	Principal Victoria, this isn't Butters' fault.	[]
Butters	3	0	It's not?!	[]
Stephen	18	0	It has to do with... biology.  You've... maybe noticed that Butters isn't... exactly like other kids.	[]
Butters	1	0	Yeah?	[]
Stephen	7	0	You probably think Butters seems somehow... different.	[]
Butters	5	0	Hey yeah, all the time.	[]
Stephen	19	0	It's because he is.  His mother and I... his whole family were... we're not of this place.	[]
Principal Victoria	9	0	Ah I'm sorry, I really don't understand.	[]
Stephen	54	0	Please, just try to understand that for our people it's a very private matter. He can't be helped by your discipline; this must be dealt with by his own kind. If it's all right with you, we'd like an extended leave for our boy. Please. It's a cultural thing.	[]
Linda	12	0	I don't want him to go, Stephen, he's too young!	[]
Stephen	14	0	It's our people's way, Linda, you know that better than I do!	[]
Linda	6	0	Then we can go with him.	[]
Stephen	6	0	You know that's not allowed!	[]
Butters	11	0	Will somebody tell me what the frickity fookshmere is goin' on?!	[]
Stephen	19	0	Butters, you've reached the age where you must journey to your birthplace for the ceremony of hapa noa.	[]
Butters	6	0	Uhbu-but I'm from here.	[]
Stephen	28	0	No. We moved here just before you started pre-school. You were born in our native land, Butters.  A distant and very secluded island world called... Hava'i.	[]
Butters	4	0	We're from Hawaii?	[]
Stephen	88	0	Only haoles pronounce it Hawaii, Butters, but those of us from Hava'i are a very special people. We have many customs and traditions to keep our culture alive.  We drink chi-chi's from the coconut. We eat poke that the Safeway provides. And when we've chosen a mate, we marry at the fern grotto, as your mother and I did so... very long ago. As a Stotch, Butters, you are actually Hawaiian royalty. Your grandma and grandpa were there at the time of the King.	[]
Butters	18	0	But what does being Hawaiian have to do with me acting like an emo chick on her period?	[]
Stephen	82	0	Not an emo chick on her period, Butters. Like a salmon needing to swim back upriver. All Hawaiians feel it. It is called hapahui apahoha, and it means it's now your time to make your trip to our island home. You must do your walkabout to your homeland, Butters. And you must do it alone.  Take this, son. It is our Mahalo Rewards card. It will provide you with all you need. And now I must turn my back on you.	[]
Cartman	13	6	Holy shit balls! Holy shit balls! Guess what, you guys? Holy shit balls.	['shit', 'balls', 'shit', 'balls', 'shit', 'balls']
Kyle	1	0	What?	[]
Cartman	16	0	Butters just got on a bus with his backpack and said he's going to Hawaii.	[]
Stan	1	0	Hawaii?	[]
Cartman	27	1	He said he had to go back to his homeland, and then told me it was none of my business and to keep my fat mouth shut.	['fat']
Kyle	9	1	Dude, what the hell? Somebody's gotta stop him.	['hell']
Stan	12	0	After all the things he said to us, he can go ahead.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Kenny, you're clearly his best friend. Go stop him.	[]
Kenny	6	0	(I'm not his best friend.)	[]
Cartman	14	1	Yeah, Mr. Perfect, go rescue Butters so he can lick your balls some more.	['balls']
Kenny	3	0	(Butters, come on.)	[]
Butters	44	0	They won't let me on the plane. Why, I can't do anything right!  No, no! I have to go to Hawaii, Kenny! I have no idea what's waiting there for me, but I guh, I can't go on like this!	[]
Kenny	8	0	(Excuse me, he needs to go to Hawaii.)	[]
Teller	17	0	I already told him, I can't allow anyone on the aircraft who appears to be intoxicated.	[]
Butters	14	0	I'm not intoxicated, you skank! I'm just deligerent because of my hapanuanalua!	[]
Kenny	14	0	(Please, could you just let him on the plane? It's really important. Please?)	[]
Teller	24	0	Tell you what: there's plenty of points on his Mahalo Rewards card. If you wanna fly with him, I can let him go.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Me?)	[]
Butters	15	0	Can't you see I'm in horrible pain?! Do you have any idea what-?!	[]
Kenny	5	0	(Okay, okay! I'll go.)	[]
Butters	9	0	Well, we're here, now what do I do?	[]
Officer	6	0	Can I help you with anything?	[]
Butters	14	0	Uh yeah, I uh, I'm not sure where I'm supposed to go?	[]
Officer	11	0	Okay, were you wit a cruise ship or land tour group?	[]
Butters	12	0	Oh, ah, I'm not a tourist. I'm a native Hawaiian.	[]
Blond Man	2	0	Butters Stotch?	[]
Butters	1	0	Yeah?	[]
Blond Man	19	0	Welcome home, young keiki. Your parents said you would be coming for your ceremony.  Ah- uh, who's this?	[]
Butters	7	0	Oh thi-this is my friend, Kenny.	[]
Older Woman	13	0	Butters, native Hawaiians don't really approve of haoles coming to their ceremonies.	[]
Butters	14	0	Oh please, i-if it weren't for him I couldn't have come.	[]
Blond Man	15	0	Very well, we shall speak with the chief of our island and see. Come now.	[]
Butters	7	0	You folks are all native Hawaiians too?	[]
Older Man	27	0	Yes. My wife Patty and I have been coming to Kaua'i for almost five years, and Bill and Donna actually own a time share in Poipu.	[]
Donna	12	0	Yes, but Poipu is getting pretty overrun with tourists, I'm afraid.	[]
Blond Man	3	0	Let us eat.	[]
Older Man	11	0	Oh yea, let us eat.  Aloha, five order of saimin, please.	[]
Butters	3	0	What's saimin?	[]
Patty	9	0	It's one of the foods of our people.	[]
Older Man	45	0	Oh, I get 20% off, I'm a native. Here's my Mahalo Rewards card.  Mahalo.  Come on, you frickin' tourist! Jesus, buy a post card!  These are the ancient ruins of our ancestors.  They say the spirit of the king is still in there.	[]
Blond Man	10	0	You must stay away from this place. It is kapu.	[]
Brunet Man	7	0	Kapu. that means taboo,  especially to haoles!	[]
Older Man	57	0	Uh that there is Bubba's Burgers.  In Havai'i us natives say Bubba's Bruk.  Here's the Sheraton, just another megahotel for the throngs of tourists. Here's where many of us natives live. The Sheraton Residences.  It's all right, we're natives.  Protector and Chief, I present to you the keiki, Butters Stotch.	[]
Chief	22	0	Ah, Stephen and Linda's child. Last time I saw you, you were the size of a coconut. Who's the haole?	[]
Kenny	129	0	My dearest friends. I am living amongst the natives in the remote and tiny island of Kava'i. What can I tell you of this mysterious island and its people? It is a place of wonder, and yet to the outsider like me, a place of odd tradition. The people here are peaceful and joyous, and seem to care little for the rush and worry of the outside world. Their diet is mostly an odd mixture of coconut milk, pineapple juice, and vodka, which they call the chi-chi. As for Butters, he is quickly learning the ways of his ancestors, and seems to be feeling better with every passing day. He still seems quite angry at times, but luckily his ceremony will finally take place on the morrow.	[]
Stan	10	1	On the morrow? What the fuck is wrong with Kenny?	['fuck']
Kenny	50	1	To wit, I have found nothing wrong with this remote place, and I must admit it will be with some melancholy that I will leave this island and return home. I saw this chick in a bikini on the beach too. She had the nicest boobs ever. Humbly yours, Kenneth.	['boobs']
Chief	34	0	In the time-honored traditions of our ancestors, we honor the native Hawaiian Butters Stotch with his hapa noa.  The shark-tooth necklace represents your connection to our island.  Now drink the chi-chi!	[]
Butters	5	0	Whoa, it's like gasoline!	[]
Chief	14	0	Drink, young keiki, and you will feel the last of your aggression melt away.	[]
Butters	9	0	Hey, uh now I do feel butter, uh better.	[]
Chief	20	0	O spirits of ancestors, we ask that you bless this native Hawaiian with his hapa noa! We ask that you-	[]
Blond Man	8	0	Listen!  Listen everyone! I have terrible, horrible news!	[]
Chief	10	0	Do you realize that you are interrupting a hapa noa?	[]
Blond Man	13	0	I've just come from the front office! The Mahalo Rewards card is...	[]
Chief	5	0	What?! What has happened? Speak!	[]
Blond Man	22	0	The Mahalo Rewards card is being eliminated! They're trying to say our points are... are... no longer going to be accepted.	[]
Chief	9	0	I knew one day it would come to this.	[]
Patty	6	0	To what? What does this mean?	[]
Chief	9	0	The haoles are trying to do away with us.	[]
Resident 1	21	0	With no rewards program, there will be no distinction between who's a native to this island and who isn't!	[]
Resident 2	14	0	Why can't you people respect our island? Why do you always want nore?!	[]
Chief	31	0	I'm sorry keiki, your hapa noa will have to wait! For we must unite together as never before! It is time to show the haoles that this is our island!	[]
Chief	6	0	Stop ruining our island, haoles! FIRE!	[]
First Mate	4	0	What are they doing?	[]
Chief	10	0	Take a swing! Let them know they are not welcome!	[]
Butters	6	0	I've never done this before.	[]
Chief	15	0	It's all right. Just try to tap into that anger that's inside you.	[]
Butters	7	0	Aim... my anger! Stupid  Ben Affleck!  Waaah!	[]
Man	4	0	Hold on!  Hold on!	[]
Woman	12	0	Oh I can't! I can't! I can't hold on!	[]
Man	6	0	I love you! I love you!	[]
Woman	8	0	No! I love you! I love you back!	[]
Announcer	4	0	This is breaking news!	[]
Anchor	29	0	An insurrection in the Hawaiian Islands has escalated to war! After sinking a cruise ship, the natives of Kauai continue to go berserk, forcing all tourists off their island.	[]
Man 1	13	0	They just pushed us onto airplanes and said we weren't welcome anymore!	[]
Woman 1	8	0	Then a little boy called me a skank.	[]
Anchor	23	0	The President says he will send the Coast Guard to take the island back, though he sympathizes, being a native Hawaiian himself.  Hm.	[]
Chief	8	0	Are all the tourists gone from our island?	[]
Resident 3	22	0	All but a few who are hiding out at Duke's Restaurant. We sent Bob and Trisha Turner to smoke them out.	[]
Resident 4	3	0	What about him?	[]
Kenny	3	0	(What about me?)	[]
Resident 4	13	0	He's a tourist and he knows everything! We have to kill him!	[]
Butters	18	0	No! Kenny's my friend! He's the only kid at school I actually like, you buncha jerks!	[]
Chief	24	0	Be careful young keiki, your anger still controls you because we were not able to finish the ceremony. Perhaps we should finish it now.	[]
Resident 4	46	0	Finish his ceremony?! We are at war, David! I have lived on this island for ten years. Ten years! Every July and part of August! And I can tell you all that what we are about to face from the haoles is nothing short of genocide!	[]
Resident 5	10	0	He's right, David. We can't trust any tourists.	[]
Butters	8	0	He won't betray us! Will you, Kenny?!	[]
Kenny	9	1	(No, I'm not going to fucking betray anybody!)	['fucking']
Resident 6	9	0	Then let him prove himself! Trial by opahika'a!	[]
Chief David	5	0	He's only a child!	[]
Resident 4	14	0	If he wants to be one of us, then he must face the challenge!	[]
Chief David	2	0	Very well.	[]
Blond Man	14	0	This isn't right! He's not a native! He's gonna get killed!	[]
Butters	3	0	Kenny, be careful!	[]
Chief David	7	0	Quiet. He must face this challenge alone.	[]
Resident 1	13	0	By the gods! Perhaps he has the heart of a native after all!	[]
Resident 4	8	0	He still has yet to make the turn!	[]
Residents	1	0	Hohhh!	[]
Resident 7	4	0	That's pretty good.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Whoops!)	[]
Butters	1	0	Kenny!	[]
Residents	1	0	Awwwww.	[]
Resident 4	9	0	I told you a haole couldn't do it!	[]
Chief David	12	0	Did you make the turn your first try? Did any of us?	[]
Resident 8	19	0	Don't worry, Butters, your friend will find a way back to his kind. The gods will protect him.	[]
Chief David	24	0	We have called for this great meeting because if we are to survive this war, all the native Hawaiian tribes must join as one!	[]
Resident 9	19	0	We're not joining the people of the Hyatt Grand Vacations! They have no rights to call themselves natives!	[]
Vacationer 1	24	0	Oh and you do?! Your ancestors came on an airplane six months ago! Our ancestors sailed here! On a cruise ship! Nine months ago!	[]
Chief David	16	0	Look, if we are to fight the haoles, we have to allow all natives to say!	[]
Canyoner	34	0	It doesn't matter how many tribes we have, we can't win! We are but a few against the haole's military might! We may have passion, but passion does not win wars!	[]
Chief David	19	0	Oh no? Come up here, keiki. Come on.  This child sunk a cruise ship by himself! Tell them keiki.	[]
Butters	50	1	Well I don't know about the rest of ya, but I'm sick and tired of bein' pushed around all the time! I came all the way down here for my hapa noa ceremony, and I can't even have it, 'cause the fucking haoles have to ruin everything!	['fucking']
Resident 9	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Vacationer 1	2	0	Screw them!	[]
Butters	27	2	Well if you ask me, the only good haole is a dead haole! With a, with a stick up his butthole, and his wiener cut off! Rraahhhh!	['butthole', 'wiener']
Chief David	9	0	Let us make a pact with more chi-chis!	[]
Resident 10	9	0	Um, we're... we're out of chi-chis.	[]
Resident 11	9	0	Oh, right, we've closed off all the ports.	[]
Resident 12	17	0	But they're still letting vodka through, right? Uh... they can't cut off our chi-chis.	[]
Chief David	3	0	...Oh my God.	[]
Captain	17	0	This is the U.S. Coast Guard! We have instructions to take you by force, if necessary!	[]
Chief David	2	0	Ready? Fire!	[]
Captain	1	0	Fire.	[]
Chief David	4	1	Arm the bocce balls!	['balls']
Captain	3	1	God damn it.	['damn']
Chief David	5	0	Keep fighting! Stand your ground!	[]
Resident 4	7	0	We can't fight without chi-chis!	[]
Chief David	5	0	You can and you MUST!	[]
Butters	6	0	Stupid! Greedy! Haoles! Kill! Them! All!	[]
The King	11	0	Come on, come on.  You know what chi-chis are, right?	[]
Chief David	24	0	Listen everyone, we gave it all we had. It's over. We must go down to Nowiliwili Harbor, and surrender to the American government.	[]
Butters	6	0	Surrender?! No, the heck with that!	[]
Resident 4	8	0	We can't hold out here any longer!	[]
Butters	16	0	Well I won't do it, you hear me?! I'm not licking anybody's... testes!	[]
Chief David	7	0	Young keiki, try to control your anger.	[]
Butters	99	0	No! This is our home! And I'm sick of everyone who thinks they're better than me just 'cause they've got good looks, and just 'cause, even after massacring Daredevil, they happen to come back and hit a home run that everyone likes! You shouldn't be able to be good-looking and be with Jennifer Lopez and be a good director!  All right all right fine! Argo is a good movie! There, I admitted it! I told people that it didn't hold up, but it holds up god darn it! Ben Affleck has everything, GRAGH!	[]
Resident 13	4	0	Everyone! Look, I say!	[]
Resident 14	4	0	The haole did it!	[]
Kenny	34	0	My dear friends of the mainland, What adventures I have found on the tiny island of Kava'i. I have truly become one with the natives, who found new courage to fight their oppressors.	[]
Chief David	19	0	We are not surrendering today! Go back and tell your leaders that we will fight them until the end!	[]
Captain	9	0	You people just don't give up, do ya?	[]
Kenny	27	0	The American government finally gave in to the natives and had the Mahalo Rewards cards reinstated. Our two cultures, it appears, will once again live in peace.	[]
Kenny	29	0	With the war at an end, our Butters is able to have his hapa noa ceremony. And with any help from the gods, become his old cheery self again.	[]
Chief David	38	0	And so it is with great honor that we recognize these two natives with their hapa noa. Take your cards, boys.  Apuiloa hapnanoaha! Hapa'a'a hohaaa!  It's finally over, young keiki. Is your anger at rest?	[]
Butters	30	0	Yeah, I guess so. Except it still doesn't change the fact that Ben Affleck gets to be handsome, talented, and then gets to go home and kiss Jennifer Lopez.	[]
Resident 15	14	0	Ben Affleck isn't with Jennifer Lopez anymore, he's married to Jennifer Gardner.	[]
Residents	6	0	Yeah, it's true, uh huh.	[]
Butters	26	0	What? Really? But I thought I was totally jealous of him. He's just married to Jennifer Gardner? Oh my God, I feel so much better.	[]
Kenny	2	0	(You do?)	[]
Butters	51	0	Yeah, ogh, I like that Ben Affleck guy. He's a good filmmaker. Come on, Kenny, I guess I owe the kids at school an apology.  Did you see Argo, Kenny? It's a pretty good movie. Ben Affleck has a lot goin' for him. Not everything, but a lot. Whoopie!	[]
