Aslan	54	0	Imaginationland... used to be a happy place. But then the terrorists attacked.  And so many of us were killed.  The Barrier came down, and all the most evil imaginary characters were unleashed.  Now our final battle will take place. The evil characters are marching toward us with the intent to wipe us all out.	[]
Beavery Beaver	6	0	This is gonna be fun, huh?	[]
Aslan	54	0	We prepare for a battle we cannot win.  Sweet and cuddly imaginary characters, many who have never held a weapon,  must now fight for their very lives. We are too few in number,  but we have one hope. That is where you come in, young boy.  Only you can help us win this battle.	[]
Butters	5	0	Wuh, what can I do?	[]
Aslan	11	0	You have a power here that you have yet to understand.	[]
Al Gore	38	0	Back it up!  Look!  Right there!  See that?!  What does that look like to you?! It's ManBearPig!  I told you it was real!  Look again!  There! half man, half bear, and half pig! Do you see it?!	[]
Official 1	6	0	Yes, we see it, Mr. Gore.	[]
Al Gore	16	0	Something big is going on, and the American people need to know what! I'm off!	[]
Doctor	21	0	He's recovering, but there's been some trauma to his brain. The boy says he's been hearing imaginary voices.	[]
Stan	3	0	Hello?  Hello? Anybody?	[]
Kyle	1	0	Stan?	[]
Stan	1	0	Hello?	[]
Kyle	1	0	Stan?	[]
Cartman	7	0	Good morning, Kyle. How are we feeling?	[]
Kyle	4	0	Cartman, what's happened?	[]
Cartman	33	1	What's happened? Well, let's see: You bet me that I couldn't prove that leprechauns were real. And if I could prove it, you had to suck my balls, I believe.	['balls']
Kyle	8	0	No, I mean what happened at the Pentagon?!	[]
Cartman	48	0	You just rest, Kyle.  Look what I made for you. A sundae. It has hot fudge and whipped cream and a cherry-  but... I feel like something is missing; don't you, Kyle?  What else belongs on a sundae besides hot fudge and whipped cream,  let's see	[]
Kyle	1	0	Arh!	[]
Cartman	29	1	Hot fudge, whipped cream, what else belongs on a sundae, Kyle?  What else goes on a sundae besides hot fudge,whipped cream, and ...oh, that's right!  My balls!	['balls']
Kyle	11	0	Cartman, what is going on out there?! What happened to Stan?!	[]
Cartman	26	0	Oh, he got sucked through that portal thing and they're gonna nuke it now.  So are you all set for your big photo shoot, Kyle?	[]
Kyle	9	0	Wwait, what do you mean? Stan's in danger?	[]
Cartman	37	1	Don't try to change the subject, Kyle.  You've done a really good job of getting out of this bet, but it's finally time to settle. Get ready for your sundae, Kyle. With extra nuts.	['nuts']
Jesus	7	0	Aslan, the evil characters are almost here!	[]
Aslan	17	0	Get everyone to the battlefield! Defend the castle walls! Quickly young boy, we need your powers now!	[]
Butters	7	0	What powers? Ah I don't understand.	[]
Gandalf	16	0	You are real. You are a creator. That means you can imagine things into existence here.	[]
Butters	4	0	I c-I can?	[]
Aslan	20	0	Santa Claus was killed in the terrorist attack. The first thing we need is for you to bring him back.	[]
Butters	1	0	How?	[]
Glinda	12	0	You just have to focus your mind. Imagine Santa and nothing else.	[]
Butters	12	1	How am I supposed to focus with all this crap goin' on?!	['crap']
Luke Skywalker	10	0	Think only of one thing. Imagine it. Believe in it.	[]
Gandalf	11	0	Whatever is most prominent in your mind will come to be.	[]
Steven	9	0	Butters!  You are grounded, mister! You hear me?!  Grounded!	[]
Butters	6	0	AAAAAAAAA! No, nonono, no no no!	[]
Aslan	7	0	What are you doing?! We need Santa!	[]
Butters	3	0	I'm trying!	[]
Wonder Woman	8	0	Come on, kid, imagine Santa! Believe in Santa!	[]
Zeus	5	0	You must believe in Santa!	[]
Aslan	5	0	BELIEVE IN SANTA! RIGHT NOW!	[]
Butters	2	0	GAA HAA!	[]
Cartman	21	0	Kevin, can I get some more bounce off that too, 'kay? Let's just go with a 5 6 8 split	[]
Kyle	15	0	Carman, will you shut up? I'm trying to find out what's going on.	[]
Anchorman	37	0	A new terrorist attack seems to have taken place. This time, in our imagination.  Al Gore brought this video to the public's attention, sparking demands by everyone who wants to know exactly what's going on.	[]
General	31	0	We were hoping to keep this quiet until it was all over, but, two days ago there was a terrorist attack on our imagination, and now our imaginations are running wild.	[]
Reporter 1	10	0	Our imaginations are running wild and we weren't told?!	[]
General	27	0	By attacking our imagination the terrorists have found our most vulnerable spot. And we've determined that the best course of action is to nuke our imagination.	[]
Reporter 2	6	0	Is nuking our imagination really prudent?	[]
Reporter 3	13	0	Aren't there other, more peaceful ways to get our imagination under control?	[]
Reporter 4	19	0	Couldn't we trying sending Kurt Russell into a portal to our imagination to try and reason with the-	[]
General	11	1	We tried that! And Kurt Russell was raped by Christmas Critters!	['raped']
Reporter 5	2	0	...A-ooch	[]
Anchorman	20	0	The Pentagon claims that because imaginary things are not real, the military doesn't need Senate approval to nuke them.	[]
Hippie 1	10	1	That's bullcrap, man! You can't nuke our imagination!	['bullcrap']
Hippie 2	7	0	Don't nuke our imagination bro! WOOO!	[]
Anchorman	11	0	Mike, does the military have the authority to nuke our imagination?	[]
Mike	50	0	Uh clearly they don't, Steven, and they're gonna have a big problem because state government has already set a precedent that imaginary characters are real. I cite a famous case of Cartman v. Broflovski in which a U.S. court found for the plaintiff who saw a leprechaun.	[]
Anchorman	15	1	Yes, I believe the defendant had to suck the plaintiff's balls in that case.	['balls']
Mike	5	0	That's right, Steven, yeah.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Oh for the love of God!	[]
Stan	5	0	Hello? Can anybody hear me?	[]
Kyle	5	0	Stan! Dude, is that you?	[]
Stan	10	0	Kyle? Where are you? I, I don't see you.	[]
Kyle	18	0	No, I'm not there. I'm at a hospital. I I'm hearing you in my imagination.	[]
Stan	4	0	...Oh that makes sense.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Dude, what's happening?	[]
Stan	34	0	I'm in like a gumdrop forest. I just saw Strawberry Shortcake tied up and dead with pee in her eye.  Ha-hang on. I think something really big is about to go down.	[]
Lollipop King	5	0	The evil characters are here.	[]
Jesus	7	0	There are so many of them. HAAAAA!	[]
Aslan	18	0	There's no time left! You have to get control of your imagination and bring Santa back NOW!	[]
Butters	2	0	Santa. Saaanta.	[]
Luke Skywalker	8	0	Think. Jolly old Santa. Red suit, white beard.	[]
Butters	5	0	Red suit, white beard... Ssssanta!	[]
Cartman	14	1	How does that look? Can you see my balls and the sundae in frame?	['balls']
Anchorman	9	0	A shocking new development in the nuking of imagination!	[]
Chief Justice	24	0	The Supreme Court has ruled with the military that imaginary things are officially not real, and therefore no approval is needed to nuke them.	[]
General	2	0	Thank you.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Oh no.	[]
Chief Justice	19	1	This of course overturns any imagination-based verdicts in the past, including the famous Cartman v. Broflovski ballsucking case.	['ballsucking']
Cartman	1	0	...What?	[]
Steven	24	0	So it appears the military is ready to proceed with its operation, one they are calling Operation Nuke the Imagination Through the Imagination Doorway.	[]
Stan	4	0	Kyle? What's happening?	[]
Kyle	6	0	The government is gonna nuke Imaginationland.	[]
Stan	8	0	What?! You can't let them do that!	[]
Kyle	6	0	What am I supposed to do?	[]
Stan	21	0	Dude you have to stall them!  Uh- ...uh oh, what is that? Hey! G-get out of here! Leave me alone!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Stan? Stan??	[]
Cartman	4	0	Where are you going?!	[]
Kyle	13	0	I'm going to try to save Stan and Butters from getting nuked!	[]
Cartman	13	1	Okay okay, but you you have to suck my balls first real quick.	['balls']
Kyle	8	0	No, I don't! The decision was overturned.	[]
Cartman	5	0	We had a DEAL KYLE!	[]
Kyle	30	1	Yeah, that leprechauns were real! And the government just declared they AREN'T technically real, so I was right! It's over! I don't have to suck your balls!	['balls']
Cartman	48	1	IT ISN'T OVER!!  It isn't over, Kyle! I have NOT waited this long to see you weasel your way out of this bet! Go ahead and go. But I swear on my life! Before this day is over! You, will, suck my balls! I SWEAR IT!!	['balls']
Morpheus	6	0	I need more spinach for Popeye!	[]
Tron Soldier	7	0	I-ee got one. I got him.	[]
Beary Bear	2	0	Hey there.	[]
Icarus	12	0	We're losing the battle! There are simply too many of them!	[]
Aslan	5	0	Then the day is lost.	[]
Wonder Woman	3	0	Wait! Aslan, look!	[]
Santa	3	0	What? What happened?	[]
Luke Skywalker	4	0	You did it, kid!	[]
Aslan	8	0	Quickly Santa! They need you on the battlefield!	[]
Santa	8	0	Huh?  Oh, all right.  Make way for Santa!	[]
Aslan	24	0	Now you see your potential, young creator. But there is still much more we need from you if we are to win this day!	[]
Guard 2	6	0	This area is restricted, little boy.	[]
Kyle	16	0	Please, I need to talk to the people inside. They can't set off that nuke.	[]
Guard 2	8	0	Get behind the line with the other protesters!	[]
Hippie 3	7	0	No nukes in our imagination, bro! Wooo!	[]
Kyle	17	0	Uhn, you don't understand! My friend is in Imaginationland! I can hear him in my head!	[]
Guard 2	12	0	You pot-smokin' hippies aren't gettin' through here, so back off!	[]
Hippie 4	3	0	Stop that nuke!	[]
Hippies	3	0	Stop that nuke!	[]
Hippies and Kyle	3	0	Stop that nuke!	[]
Al Gore	19	0	What's going on here?  The military has to do this! It's their only way to kill ManBearPig.	[]
Aslan	11	0	Good, Butters. Now imagine some more archers on the castle walls!	[]
Butters	1	0	Huwhoa!	[]
Perseus	6	0	Aslan! We're losing the battle!	[]
Robin Hood	21	0	We managed to fight off the vampires and werewolves, but... now our troops are being shot down by the Cavity Creeps.	[]
Aslan	2	0	Cavity Creeps?	[]
Cavity Creeps	10	0	We make holes in teeth! We make holes in teeth!	[]
Wonder Woman	6	0	What can destroy the Cavity Creeps?	[]
Perseus	6	0	Only Crest Gel with Tartar Control.	[]
Aslan	8	0	Quickly! You must imagine a giant Crest Gel!	[]
Robin Hood	1	0	Yes!	[]
Gandalf	12	0	His powers are getting stronger. We might just have a chance here.	[]
Archangel	13	0	Aslan, we've captured a spy! He was sneaking around the Gumdrop Forest!	[]
Butters	7	0	Stan!  Hey look, I imagined Stan here!	[]
Stan	12	0	No, no! I got sucked through Operation Imagination Doorway at the Pentagon.	[]
Aslan	3	0	Project Imagination Doorway?	[]
Gandalf	13	0	Never mind! The battle is almost won! We can deal with him later.	[]
Stan	19	0	No, no, you don't understand. There's a nuke. The government is about to level this entire place.	[]
Luke Skywalker	1	0	What?	[]
Butters	6	0	Wull why would they nuke Imaginationland?	[]
Stan	11	0	So the terrorists can't ever use it against us again.	[]
Aslan	13	0	We can get Imaginationland under control; the Chosen One just needs more time!	[]
Stan	3	0	The Chosen One?	[]
Butters	8	0	Yeah, it turns out I'm the Key.	[]
Computer	4	0	Missile launch sequence initiated.	[]
General	11	0	All right, people, I want this nuking done by the books.	[]
Tech 1	6	0	Sir, we have a security breach!	[]
General	1	0	What?!	[]
Tech 3	13	0	There's an Unauthorized Entry Alert, sir-it's coming from Sector Two!	[]
General	2	0	Sector 2?	[]
Cartman	14	1	What the hell do you think you're doing declaring leprechauns aren't real?!	['hell']
General	1	0	What?	[]
Cartman	29	0	You just can't declare that imaginary things aren't real! Who are you to say what's real?! Think about it: is blue real? Is love really real?	[]
Lab Tech	12	0	Imaginary things are things made up by people, like Santa and Rudolph.	[]
Tom	9	0	Yeah, and they detract from real things, like Jesus.	[]
Tech 1	5	0	Maybe Jesus is imaginary too.	[]
Tom	12	1	Ooooh, you'd better not say that! You'll go to hell!	['hell']
Tech 7	8	1	It's possible that hell is also imaginary.	['hell']
Tech 2	15	1	Uh so then, we're about to nuke hell... that's a good thing, right?	['hell']
Personnel	8	1	Hell yeah, that's a good thing, yeah.	['hell']
Lab Tech	10	0	What if heaven is imaginary? We'd be nuking heaven.	[]
Tech 3	7	0	Yeah, but it wouldn't be real.	[]
Lab Tech 2	6	0	So it'd be all right.	[]
Cartman	27	1	Look, maybe they're all part of the same thing. Santa and Jesus and hell and- leprechauns. Maybe they're all real in the same wway, right?	['hell']
Tom	12	1	Santa Claus and leprechauns are imaginary, but Jesus and hell are real!	['hell']
Tech 3	5	0	Well then, what about Buddha?	[]
Tom	6	0	Well of course he's imaginary!	[]
Lab Tech 3	8	0	Awww, see? Now you're being intolerant, Tom.	[]
Tech 7	3	0	Am I real?	[]
General	20	0	All right, enough! Keep that kid out of the way and let's get back to the nuking at hand!	[]
Cartman	5	1	No! Leprechauns are real, Goddammit!	['goddammit']
Stan	4	0	Kyle? Kyle, what happened?	[]
Kyle	1	0	Nothing.	[]
Stan	1	0	What??	[]
Kyle	8	0	Nothing happened! There's nothing I can do!	[]
Stan	11	0	Dude, you can't let the government fire off that nuke!	[]
Kyle	14	0	They say they can do whatever they want because imaginary things aren't real!	[]
Stan	9	0	Well you have to convince them they are real!	[]
Kyle	12	1	No way, dude, then I'd have to suck Cartman's balls	['balls']
Stan	20	0	Whatever it takes, you have to do it, all right?!  Hang- hang on, Kyle, Jesus wants to talk to you.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Huh?	[]
Jesus	5	0	Hello, Kyle? This is Jesus.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Oh boy...	[]
Jesus	8	0	What seems to be the problem, my child?	[]
Kyle	20	0	Jesus, I can't do anything.  I'm just a fourth grader going against the entire government.  Uh, hello? Jesus?	[]
Luke Skywalker	8	0	No eh, hey Kyle, this is Luke Skywalker.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Aah.	[]
Luke Skywalker	29	0	Look, I know this seems like an impossible task, but do you remember when I brought down the Death Star. I m, I mean, that seemed impossible too, right?	[]
Kyle	3	0	Yeah, I guess.	[]
Luke Skywalker	16	0	Uh okay, now, now hold on, because Superman is here and he wants to say something.	[]
Superman	4	0	Kyle, this is Superman.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Hi Superman.	[]
Superman	20	0	I know that saving people can be a big responsibility, but no matter what it takes, it's worth it.	[]
Kyle	2	0	I know.	[]
Superman	15	0	You can do this, Kyle. How hang on, because Hercules wants to talk to you.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Oh God...	[]
Superman	15	0	Yes, God is here too. He's gonna talk to you right after Captain Crunch.	[]
Jesus	6	0	Popeye, I need some help here!	[]
Lollipop King	7	0	Popeye is being killed by Christmas Critters.	[]
Popeye	6	0	Gaw guguh, getskug off of me!	[]
Beary Bear	4	0	Hey, what is that?	[]
Butters	9	0	More spinach for Popeye!  Imagine an M60 for Jesus!	[]
Jesus	2	0	All right!	[]
Aslan	11	0	The boy is doing it! Everything is going to be okay!	[]
Computer	5	0	Missile launch in one minute.	[]
Cartman	9	2	Goddamnit, you stupid assholes are going to ruin everything!	['goddamnit', 'assholes']
General	3	0	Prepare for launch...	[]
Tech 1	6	0	Sir, we have a security breach!	[]
General	1	0	What?!	[]
Tech 3	13	0	There's an Unauthorized Entry Alert, sir-it's coming from Sector Two!	[]
General	2	0	Sector 2?	[]
Cartman	1	0	Kyle?	[]
General	7	1	The hell are you doing back here?!	['hell']
Kyle	15	0	Listen, you don't have to do this! Our imaginations aren't running wild anymore.	[]
General	12	0	Why is it so easy for children to break into the Pentagon?!	[]
Kyle	4	0	You have to stop!	[]
General	23	0	If I'm not mistaken, you're the one who bet that leprechauns weren't real. So why do you care what happens?	[]
Kyle	135	0	Because I-  I... Um... because I think... they are real. It's all real. Think about it. Haven't Luke Skywalker and Santa Claus affected your lives more than most real people in this room? I mean, whether Jesus is real or not, he... he's had a bigger impact on the world than any of us have. And the same could be said of Bugs Bunny and, a-and Superman and Harry Potter. They've changed my life, changed the way I act on the Earth. Doesn't that make them kind of real. They might be imaginary, but, but they're more important than most of us here. And they're all gonna be around long after we're dead. So in a way, those things are more realer than any of us.	[]
General	3	0	Abort the sequence.	[]
Cartman	24	0	So Kyle, imaginary things are real, huh? Guess that means I did win the bet after all. And you know what that means, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	71	6	Just let it go with your fucking balls, you fucking asshole!! Your friends have been in danger and all you care about it this stupid bet! Well I've decided, Cartman, even if we had a bet, that I am never sucking your balls,  you got that?! They can throw me in jail for the rest of my life, but I am  never going to suck your balls,  never! So  there!	['fucking', 'balls', 'fucking', 'asshole', 'balls', 'balls']
Al Gore	9	0	What happened?! Why hasn't the missile gone off?!	[]
General	7	0	There's been an abort, Mr. Gore.	[]
Al Gore	5	0	No! ManBearPig has to die!	[]
Tech 3	3	0	Oh Jesus no!	[]
Lollipop King	9	0	That's it, Aslan! The evil characters have fled!	[]
Aslan	4	0	The day is ours!	[]
Stan	1	0	Kyle!	[]
Butters	6	0	Fellas! Where'd you come from?	[]
Zeus	3	0	What is that?	[]
Butters	1	0	Huh...	[]
Jesus	3	0	He did it!	[]
Fanciful Mayor	5	0	Oh look, I'm back!	[]
Luke Skywalker	3	0	Nice going, kid.	[]
Fanciful Mayor	10	0	The evil characters! They're all behind the wall again.	[]
Stan	7	0	Dude! How did you do that, Butters?	[]
Butters	6	0	Well I just... used my imagination.	[]
All	1	0	Awwww	[]
Cartman	57	0	You know, I really have learned a lot, you guys. What Kyle said about imaginary things being real and, Butters using his imagination? It makes me think that... well maybe we all have the power to make things a reality.   Why look, it's me. And...  And there's Kyle. And, what's Kyle about to do?	[]
Kyle	3	0	Cartman, don't!	[]
Cartman	18	2	O-hoo Kyle! What are you doing to my balls? OHO, look! It's Kyle sucking my balls!	['balls', 'balls']
Stan	1	0	Dude.	[]
Lollipop King	3	0	Oh my God.	[]
Cartman	27	2	O-hoo Kyle, you are gobbling those balls, aren't you? I told you you would suck my balls before this was over, didn't I, Kyle?	['balls', 'balls']
Kyle	9	1	I'm not sucking your balls; that's imaginary!	['balls']
Cartman	11	0	No- Kyle, I believe you said that imaginary things are real.	[]
General	5	0	That's true. You did.	[]
Cartman	14	1	Oh, look at you go, Kyle! Oho, you dirty girl! You LOVE those balls.	['balls']
Santa	13	1	Okay, Kyle, that's enough ballsucking. We need to get you boys home.	['ballsucking']
Kyle	7	1	I am not sucking Cartman's balls!	['balls']
Fanciful Mayor	8	0	Whatever you imagine to be real, is real.	[]
Steven	2	0	Butters?  Butters!	[]
Butters	10	0	A-huh? What? Oh! It was all just a dream.	[]
Steven	7	0	Come on, Butters, time to get up.	[]
Butters	20	0	Oh Dad! I had the craziest dream! I, I saved all of Imaginationland from running wild after a terrorist attack!	[]
Steven	36	1	You WERE in Imaginationland, Butters! We've read all about it in the paper! The question is, what were you doing in Imaginationland when you were supposed to be helping your mother clean up the basement?!	['basement']
Linda	4	0	You are grounded, mister!	[]
Butters	6	0	Ohhh.  Wait, I'm not grounded.	[]
Steven	4	0	Oh yes you are!	[]
Butters	2	0	Oh yeah?	[]
Steven	8	0	That only works in Imaginationland! You're grounded!	[]
Butters	2	1	Ahhh shit.	['shit']
