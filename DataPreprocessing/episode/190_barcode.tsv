Cartman	45	0	Alright cool, guys, gather all around. Everyone should be a witness to this.  Alright, you ready? Now say I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me. Come on, dude, I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me.	[]
Butters	13	0	I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me.  Ow.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Alright, your turn Craig.	[]
Butters	13	1	Fellas, my underwear is so far up my buttcrack my legs are numb!	['buttcrack']
Cartman	17	1	Well that's what you get for being a douchebag again Butters! You gotta take your medicine.	['douchebag']
Butters	6	0	Uyeah, I guess I deserve it.	[]
Stan	14	1	Hey heeey, what the hell are you guys picking on Butters for this time?!	['hell']
Cartman	29	0	Aw dude, you guys are not gonna believe this. You know what we just found out? Well it turns out that Butters, our Butters, has never kissed a girl	[]
Butters	1	0	Uugh!	[]
Kyle	2	0	So what?	[]
Butters	23	0	So what?!  So I'm almost nine years old and anyone who hasn't kissed a girl by fourth grade is a dork!	[]
Craig	3	0	That's right.	[]
Clyde	16	0	You guys, we got it!  We got it. Sally Darson is selling kisses for five dollars.	[]
Butters	2	0	Sellin' kisses?	[]
Clyde	18	0	She hangs out behind the temp building during afternoon recess. She'll kiss any boy that pays her.	[]
Butters	9	0	You mean I'm... gonna kiss a girl... today?	[]
Clyde	17	0	So then when she sticks her tongue out you just kind of lick it with your tongue.	[]
Butters	6	0	Oh boy, I sure am nervous.	[]
Cartman	15	0	Nothin' to be nervous about, Butters. You're finally going to become a man today.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Butters, I think you should reconsider this.	[]
Butters	3	0	Uh, how come?	[]
Kyle	20	0	Dude, you don't want your first kiss to be something you paid for. It's supposed to be special.	[]
Cartman	15	0	Oh God, why don't you sit under a rainbow and write a poem, Kyle?	[]
Butters	11	0	I gotta do this! I gotta know what it feels like!	[]
Butters	12	0	Oh boy... Oh jeez, oh, stay calm Butters... Eh, how was it?	[]
Francis	3	0	Pretty worth it.	[]
Jimmy	8	0	Go ahead, Bu-Butters. Go- go get some.	[]
Butters	6	0	I'm going!  Ohh...  Oh, hi.	[]
Sally	1	0	Hey.	[]
Butters	13	0	So ummm yeah, ah, I was hopin' maybe I could get a kiss.	[]
Sally	2	0	Okay, cool.	[]
Butters	5	0	Yeah, cool, uhhhm... umuh... okay.	[]
Sally	4	0	So you got money?	[]
Butters	13	0	Oh, money... Rrright.  There you go. A five dollar bill, all for you.	[]
Sally	4	0	All right, you ready?	[]
Butters	2	0	Thank you!	[]
Cartman	3	0	Atta boy Butters!	[]
Tweek	3	0	You did it!	[]
Jimmy	10	0	You're a man now! All right Butters good job!	[]
Token	3	0	Good job, Butters!	[]
Butters	65	0	Boy oh boy. I finally did it. I'm a man now.  Jeez, I'm gonna start havin' lots of responsibilities soon. I gotta start thinkin' about a career. There's gonna be family and bills to start worrying about. M-no more play time for you, Butters! You gotta buckle down and find, and find yourself a way to make money.  Hey, I know.	[]
Butters	24	0	Hey fellers! Fellers, do you like gettin' kisses? 'Cause I know a girl that'll give you a great kiss for just five dollars!	[]
Scott	4	0	She'll kiss anybody?	[]
Butters	7	0	Sure, Scott! Even if you got diabetes!	[]
Scott	10	0	Wow.  It's almost like having someone care about you.	[]
Sally	16	0	Jeez Butters, thanks for bringing me yet another customer. Here's your two dollar cut again.	[]
Butters	35	0	Boy oh boy, this sure is great! I've been thinkin', Sally: I could probably drum up some third grade customers if you could do kisses before school too. We could make double the money.	[]
Sally	17	0	Oh, that'd be great, but I can't do kisses before school. I have swimming class.	[]
Butters	20	1	Aww nuts!  Well, I did have another idea. What if we got another girl to fill in for you sometimes?	['nuts']
Sally	1	0	What?	[]
Butters	19	0	Well, you know, we bring someone on, show her what to do, and then share all our money together.	[]
Sally	9	0	Wow, you're right Butters. I should start expanding.	[]
Butters	8	0	We could have our very own...  kissin' company.	[]
Butters	42	0	The next key to a successful business is innovation. I think maybe we need to understand that some boys simply can't afford the five dollars for a kiss, so what if we start also charging just two dollars for a hug?	[]
Sally	7	0	Wow, that's a great idea, Butters.	[]
Butters	32	0	Why thanks. Sally, I think your position behind the temp building at recess is perfect. Megan, I'm thinkin' about moving you to the baseball field after school during little league practice.	[]
Megan	2	0	Got it.	[]
Butters	52	0	I got a kissing booth set up at the kids' fair on Saturday so Kayla and Ashley, you take turns there. Any girl that sells more than twenty kisses gets  a little sunshine, but if you don't show up for work at all, I'm afraid you get a stormy cloud.	[]
Sally	5	0	This is gonna be great!	[]
Murphy	23	0	Sir! Sir, take a look at this. We've got rumors coming in of a possible prostitution company starting up in South Park.	[]
Yates	6	0	What?!  Hohoo, not in my county!	[]
Murphy	19	0	We've got no information on the prostitutes, don't know who they are or where they came from.	[]
Yates	30	1	So then we need to go after the johns. We need to let the men of this town know that if they paid for sex they're going to jail!	['sex']
Murphy	3	0	Sting operation, sir?	[]
Yates	19	0	We need an undercover cop disguised as a prostitute, so we can arrest any citizens looking for cheap thrills!	[]
Yates	7	0	Hey baby, you looking for a party?	[]
Driver	6	0	Ha... how much are you charging?	[]
Yates	13	1	Twenty for oral, fifty for half and half, anal will cost you extra.	['anal']
Driver	3	0	Aww- get in.	[]
Yates	19	2	Right here's good, sexy.  Now if you wouldn't mind handing over the twenty dollars for oral sex.	['sexy', 'sex']
Driver	2	0	Ok-okay.	[]

Driver	2	0	Awhuh! What?!	[]
Yates	27	1	This is a sting operation, scumbag, and you're going to jail for soliciting prostitution.  Got our first one, boys. I'm bringing him in for booking.	['scumbag']
Kyle	23	0	Did you guys hear what's going on? There's like four girls at the school now offering to kiss boys for money.	[]

Butters	17	0	Hey fellas. Would anyone like a coupon. We're offerin' two for one kisses today through Thursday.	[]
Stan	8	0	Butters, you're the one doing all this?	[]
Butters	16	0	Yep! I am founder and head CEO of the Butters Kissing Company. Just look at this.	[]
Cartman	9	1	Damn dude, you made all that money offa chicks?	['damn']
Butters	27	0	I'm tellin' ya guys, this is the most genius idea I've ever come up with. A lot of boys would pay to kiss my employees.	[]
Kyle	24	0	You didn't think of anything, Butters! Guys have been doing what you're doing for years! You're nothin' but a common pimp!	[]
Butters	3	0	...A pimp. Huh...	[]
Butters	43	3	Bohy, Kyle was right, Sally. There's guys with kissing companies all over the country. The person managing all the women is known as the 'pimp,' while the working women are referred to as 'ho' or 'bitch.' Oh, you're a bitch, Sally.	['ho', 'bitch', 'bitch']
Sally	1	0	Oh.	[]
Butters	33	0	Hey, look at this! There's about to be a big pimp convention, it looks like. I gotta get to that convention, Sally. I could learn all kinds of stuff for our company.	[]
Butters	36	0	Hi there. My name is Butters. This sure is a nice convention, huh? Yeah, I'm just starting out. I really came last minute 'cause I was hoping to learn more about being a successful pimp.	[]

Butters	24	0	Yeah, just about a week now. I have four girls at the moment, but I feel like I could be doing a better job.	[]
Bishop	38	0	Now see, you think you're a pimp, but you can't be pimpin', know what I'm sayin'? You wanna be a pimp, then you gotta learn the game. See it's all about knowin' the game.	[]
Butters	4	0	What's the game?	[]
Bishop	64	8	The game is how you treat the bitches, know what I'm sayin'? Bitch gotta know when she out there, she makin' yo' muthafuckin' money, know what I'm sayin'? You got yo' main bitch, know what I'm sayin'? That be your bottom bitch. That bitch rank higha than all the other bitches but she still a bitch, know what I'm sayin'?	['bitches', 'bitch', 'muthafuckin', 'bitch', 'bitch', 'bitch', 'bitches', 'bitch']
Butters	15	0	Yes I- I know what you are saying. You don't have to keep asking.	[]
Pimp 2	34	2	See it's all about mind control. You gotta act a punk. Any man can control a bitch's heart, but a pimp gotta control a bitch's mind, know what I'm sayin'?	['bitch', 'bitch']
Butters	6	0	I know what you're saying.	[]
Pimp 2	38	5	Pimp gotta be out there every motherfuckin' day keepin' his bitches in line. Can't let 'em go shoppin', spendin' their money on stupid shit. Bitches gotta think that's your motherfuckin money, know what I'm sayin'?	['motherfuckin', 'bitches', 'shit', 'bitches', 'motherfuckin']
Butters	9	0	Yeah! I believe I know what you are saying!	[]
Stephen	4	0	There you are, Butters!	[]

Butters	21	2	Aw hell Dad, I got lots of girlfriends. Sally's just my bottom bitch.  Do you know what I am saying?	['hell', 'bitch']
Driver 2	26	0	I've got to tell you I... I don't do this kind of thing very often. You're sure you're not a cop, right?	[]
Yates	9	0	No way! Let's just get to this, baby.	[]
Driver 2	1	0	Alright.	[]
Yates	14	1	So, you are agreeing to have sex with me for one hundred dollars, correct?	['sex']
Driver 2	7	0	Sure, I have the money right here.	[]
Murphy	19	0	Remember, he's going to give us the code word to move in. Wait for the code word, stretch.	[]
Officer	5	0	Code word is stretch, copy?	[]

Yates	11	0	Freeze!  You are under arrest for soliciting prostitution! Book him, boys!	[]
Driver 2	12	0	Please! Please don't do this! I have a wife and kids!	[]
Yates	29	0	A wife and kids. And you're out here trollin' the streets for prostitutes. You make me sick! Take him downtown, boys. I'm goin' back on the street.	[]
Groundskeeper	9	0	That's it recess is over back to class.	[]
Kids	1	0	Aaaaaaah.	[]
Butters	28	1	Boy oh boy, really great work, bitches. You all sold lots of kisses today. Except for you, Megan, I'm afraid you get a stormy cloud sticker today.	['bitches']
Ashley	9	0	So wait, you're keeping all the money now?	[]
Butters	57	3	I just hold on to all the money, 'cause bitches can't be trusted with it. We pool all the kissing money together, see? But if you wanna buy anything, you just talk to the bottom bitch , and then the bottom bitch talks to me. Alright, see you after school!  Do you know what I am saying?	['bitches', 'bitch', 'bitch']
Mr. Garrison	16	0	Alright children, I want you to copy down these math problems and solve them before recess.	[]
Butters	4	0	Yo, Bebe. Bebe yo.	[]
Bebe	1	0	What?	[]
Butters	7	2	Bitch you wanna make some motherfuckin' money?	['bitch', 'motherfuckin']
Bebe	1	0	What?!	[]
Butters	33	2	Bitch you should be doin' kisses on the playground. You can make fifty bucks a day! Buy all the purses and shoes that you've ever wanted. I'll treat you right, bitch.	['bitch', 'bitch']
Bebe	2	0	Shut up!	[]
Butters	17	2	Oh, alright then.  Hey Wendy. Wendy!  Bitch, don't you wanna start makin' some real fuckin' money?	['bitch', 'fuckin']
Wendy	3	0	Leave me alone.	[]
Butters	33	2	Why you were made for the playground, bitch. You should be out there workin'. Don't you want a new lunch box? Nice new coat? I can get all that for you, bitch.	['bitch', 'bitch']
Stan	2	0	Butters. Dude!	[]
Butters	1	0	What?	[]
Stan	8	1	You can't call my girlfriend a bitch!	['bitch']
Butters	33	3	Oh. Well all I'm sayin' the bitch should be out there workin' is all.  Whatcha doin' bitch? Just givin' kisses to Stan for free? Why you should be makin' some motherfuckin' money!	['bitch', 'bitch', 'motherfuckin']

Butters	21	2	All these bitches are kissin' fellers, and they haven't figured out that they can be making some serious fuckin' money!	['bitches', 'fuckin']
Butters	36	1	Really glad you joined the company, Annie! Now remember: you're chargin' five dollars for a kiss, two for a hug, and six for half and half. Alright bitch? Alright, how about a freebie?  Ohwoah,  whoopie!	['bitch']
Kyle	7	0	Butters, I really think we should talk.	[]
Butters	2	0	Sure, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	33	0	Butters, can't you see this is wrong? You've got little boys all over school spending all their lunch money on kisses. Boys shouldn't be paying for kisses. It's wrong.	[]
Butters	92	1	Kyle, every boy pays for kisses. Do you know what I am saying? If you've got a girl, and she kisses you, sooner or later you're paying for it. You've gotta take her out to lunch, take her to a movie, and then spend time listenin' to all her stupid problems. Look, look at Stan right there.  He's gotta sit there and listen to her stupid motherfuckin' problems 'cause she kisses him. If you ask me, that's a lot more than the five dollars my company charges.	['motherfuckin']
Kyle	6	0	Butters, what's happened to you?	[]
Butters	35	0	What happened is that I became a man! I'm sorry I'm not your little buddy anymore, but there's a time people have to grow up!  Do you know what I am saying?!	[]
Frat Boy 1	4	0	Alpha Tau Omega, woo!	[]

Yates	64	4	Give it to me! Come on, you sissies, I can fit more of ya!  Yeah, you like your little stripper whore?! You like her?! FREEZE!  Take them all to the station, for oral and anal sex with a prostitute! Half of them didn't even use a condom!  Don't you stupid kids know the diseases you can catch?! Hand me that evidence bag.	['whore', 'anal', 'sex', 'condom']
Murphy	18	0	Sir, sssome of us are wwwondering if maybe y-you're not... taking this role a bit far?	[]
Yates	23	0	What?! No way! Nothing is more important than keeping prostitution out of our community!  Oh, hold on, that's my daddy.  Hey Daddy.	[]
Bishop	11	2	Where you at, bitch? I need my bottom bitch right now.	['bitch', 'bitch']
Yates	8	0	Ye-yes, Daddy, I'm on my way.	[]
Bishop	19	1	I made you my bottom bitch, now you gotta take care of yo' pimp, know what I'm sayin'?	['bitch']
Yates	11	0	Be right there. Sorry guys, my daddy needs me right now.	[]
Black Bitch	8	3	Damn bitch! Yo' pimp beat yo' ass again?	['damn', 'bitch', 'ass']
White Bitch	4	1	He's an asshole.	['asshole']
Black Bitch	27	0	You know, I heard a rumor about some new pimp up in Park County. They say he's real respectful; lots of girls switching over to him.	[]
White Bitch	10	1	A pimp that respects his hos? Sign my ass up.	['ass']
Butters	9	0	And that's... three thousand dollars today for Charise.	[]
Charise	5	0	Did I do good, Daddy?	[]
Butters	11	1	REALLY great work, bitch! That is another...  sunshine sticker for you.	['bitch']
Charise	3	0	Thank you, Daddy.	[]
Butters	2	0	Mmmwhoa boy!	[]
Butters	31	0	And so, I would like to see if there are any housing loan opportunities for some of my employees, and also what kind of corporate tax I should be filing under.	[]
Receptionist	9	0	And exactly what kind of business are you running?	[]
Butters	5	0	It's a kissing company.	[]
Receptionist	6	0	And you're making a profit?	[]
Butters	58	0	Oh sure! My black employee Charise over there, one time she made two thousand dollars, on one customer! Can you believe it? Two thousand dollars just to kiss a feller. She currently stays in a motel room, 'cause a lot of her customers see her late.  You wouldn't believe the time of night some fellers wanna kiss.	[]
Receptionist	11	0	Do you keep any record of the men getting these kisses?	[]
Butters	17	1	'Course. My bottom bitch keeps a database of all our customers, specially the VIPs, like Senator Morris.	['bitch']
Receptionist	2	0	Senator Morris?	[]
Butters	17	0	Sure! Senator Morris gets kisses every day at lunchtime. You know where he likes to get kissed?	[]
Receptionist	1	0	Where?	[]
Butters	10	0	In a motel room. Darnedest thing. He must get sleepy.	[]
Receptionist	5	0	Alright, get out of here!	[]
Butters	2	0	Huh? Why?	[]
Receptionist	6	0	I'm not falling for it!	[]
Butters	9	1	But I heard ACORN helps pimps and their bitches!	['bitches']
Receptionist	8	0	We aren't giving you anything; get out!	[]
Boss	8	0	Mrs. Davis, is there some kind of problem?	[]
Receptionist	3	0	Eh no sir.	[]
Butters	15	1	Heey! Mr. Daniels! You get kisses from my bitch Roxy in the alley behind Sizzler.	['bitch']
Butters	20	1	Boy, how do you like that, bitches? Approval for two housing loans and tax-exempt status. File these away, Sally.	['bitches']
Sally	1	0	Okay.	[]
Charise	11	2	Ubup. Daddy, how come this ho get to be bottom bitch?	['ho', 'bitch']
Sally	1	0	What?	[]
Charise	19	1	I make the most money for you Daddy, that means if anyone should be bottom bitch, it's me.	['bitch']
Sally	4	1	Hey, screw off, ho.	['ho']
Charise	4	1	Fair is fair, ho.	['ho']
Butters	4	2	Whoa whoa, bitches, bitches!	['bitches', 'bitches']
Yates	70	0	Excuse me!  Well well well, this must be the organization I've been hearing so much about. Took me a long time to find you. You won't believe the hardships I've been through trying to track you down. My name is Yolanda. I'd like to know all about your operation here. You see I just left my pimp recently and I'm looking for a new one?	[]
Butters	21	1	Oh. Well we operate on a sixty-forty split here. Bitches have access to Medicare and now, low-income housing loans.	['bitches']
Yates	11	0	Well, I think that's about all I need to hear.	[]
Bishop	2	0	Yolanda!  Yolanda!	[]
Butters	3	0	What's that?	[]
Bishop	13	0	Yolanda please! You gotta come back to me! I got nothin' without you!	[]
Yates	30	0	You've got a lot of nerve coming here, Keshawn! After the way you treated me? I need a pimp that doesn't beat me every time he gets drunk!	[]
Bishop	19	1	Yolanda, I looove you. I need you. Not as my bottom bitch. I want...  I want to marry you.	['bitch']
Yates	17	1	It's too late for that, Keshawn! I just told this pimp I was his bitch now.	['bitch']
Butters	27	0	Well wait, hold on now. Why I'd never get in the way of somebody being happy. Well us pimps gotta be good. Even to each other.	[]
Bishop	30	0	Thanks, pimp. You done changed the game, that's what you did.  Marry me Yolanda? We'll move to a little chateau in Switzerland and get away from all this.	[]
Yates	2	0	Oh Keshawn!	[]

Well I enjoyed being your pimp and all, it's just that... when I see real love, like what those two people have, well, well it just makes me feel like a... well, like a dick. Well I may be a man now, but it doesn't mean I have the right to be earnin' money for what girls do, whether you're chargin' fellers for kisses by cash or by makin' them listen to your stupid motherfuckin' problems. Well that's your hard work. Bitches, this is your company now, so get out there, and make yourselves some motherfuckin' money!	['dick', 'motherfuckin', 'bitches', 'motherfuckin']
Bishop	7	0	Happy anniversary baby.  Do you like 'em?	[]
