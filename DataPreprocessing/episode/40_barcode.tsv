Kyle	16	1	I can't watch the meteor shower with you, Kenny. I have to go to Jewbilee.	['jewbilee']
Kenny	3	0	(What's that?)	[]
Kyle	43	2	It's what we do in Jew Scouts. Usually we just sit around and make stuff. But tonight, because there's a meteor shower, we're gonna do some big thing out in the woods. It's gonna suck ass, I'm sure.	['jew', 'ass']
Kenny	4	0	(Oh, that's alright.)	[]
Kyle	14	0	Hey! Maybe you can come with me. Then it won't suck so hard.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Really?)	[]
Kyle	8	1	Mom? Can Kenny go to Jewbilee with me?	['jewbilee']

Kyle	5	0	...Oh. Kenny isn't special?	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Aw.)	[]
Sheila	17	2	No, no, you're very special, Kenny. It's just that... well, Jewbilee is... for Jewish kids.	['jewbilee', 'jewish']
Gerald	47	5	You see boys, Jew Scouts is a special group that borrows a little bit from all different Jewish denominations. From the Orthodox Jews, from the Hasidic Jews, from the Northern Italy Cave Jews... But you have to believe the basic tenets of Judaism to be a Scout.	['jew', 'jewish', 'jews', 'jews', 'jews']
Kyle	8	0	Kenny'll believe whatever you want him to.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Yeah.)	[]
Sheila	5	0	Kyle, eh, the problem is...	[]
Kyle	13	0	Please, Ma. I don't think Kenny has anywhere else to be tonight.	[]

Sheila	41	0	And then, Kenny, Abraham's wife bore him no children. She had a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar. And Sarai said unto Abraham, Behold now, the Lord hath restrained me from bearing. I pray thee, go into my maid.	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Uh huh.)	[]
Sheila	25	0	Abraham begat Isaac, who the Lord then said to kill. But that was just a little silly trick to see if Abraham would do it.	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Uh huh!)	[]
Ike	2	0	Eng jeck.	[]
Kyle	10	0	No, Ike! Ma, Ike keeps taking off his Squirt uniform!	[]

Ike	4	0	Buh buh buh buh.	[]
Kyle	10	0	I don't think Ike wants to go to Squirts.	[]
Gerald	25	1	Ike, your brother Kyle was in Squirts, and so was I. You have to go so someday you can be a big brave Jew Scout.	['jew']
Ike	2	0	No-o.	[]
Gerald	8	0	Tell Ike how much fun Squirts is, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	6	0	What? You want me to lie?	[]

Ranger	8	1	Welcome to Jewbilee. You folks find it okay?	['jewbilee']
Gerald	10	0	Yeah.  Actually, we saw a bear a few miles back.	[]
Kyle	3	0	He was huge.	[]
Ranger	19	0	Yeah. We spotted him a few days ago. Nothing to worry about, though. Your boys are safe with us.	[]
Sheila	5	0	I'm sure they are.	[]
Gerald	14	0	We'll be back to pick you up after the meteor shower party, boys.	[]
Sheila	11	0	Good-bye, boys. Kyle and Ike, you be safe. And Kenny?	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Uh huh?)	[]

Kyle	3	0	Who are you?	[]
Squirt leader	40	0	I'm the Squirt leader. I don't want to be the Squirt leader, but I don't have a choice; it's the only way I can earn my chutzpah badge. So I gotta spend all night instructing Squirts.	[]

Squirt 1	8	0	How come we have to make macaroni pictures?	[]
Squirt leader	11	0	Because that's what Squirts do! Now, shut your pie-hole!	[]
Squirt 2	4	0	What's your name?	[]

Squirt 2	9	0	How come your head is lookin' so... funny-looking?	[]
Ike	2	0	Uh-uh.	[]
Elder	95	2	And that's how we'll be making tonight's craft. And so you see, Scouts, all you need is a bar of soap and a dull knife , and you can make nifty soap sculptures like these. Here's a giraffe.  And here's a cloud.  You can all pick up your bars of soap later on, as we will all be making soap sculptures tonight.  Now, this year we are pleased to announce that Jewbilee has grown to over one hundred Jew Scouts from all around the country. All new inductees, raise your hands.	['jewbilee', 'jew']

Chief elder	9	0	All sects of Judaism follow the words of Moses.	[]
Elder Garth	31	0	Not mine. Tonight's meteor shower is a sign of the New Time, heh. We should use it to pray to Haman and enter into a new millennium faith, and it--	[]
Chief elder	11	0	Enough, elder! You will not speak the name of Haman here!	[]
Elder Garth	23	1	All you ever do is worship Moses, but it says in the Book of Centuries that Haman will one day lead the Jews.	['jews']
Elder Harris	6	0	We pray to Moses here, elder.	[]
Elder Garth	13	0	If you guys love Moses so much, why don't you marry him?!	[]
Chief elder	31	0	We accept all denominations of Judaism here at Scouts, elder, but your synagogue of anti-Semites is too strange! Get out and do not return: you are no longer welcome here!	[]
Elder Garth	64	1	Fine!  Jewbilee is the time of Haman! You will all see how wrong you are, very soon! When Haman returns from the Ninth Tower of Disillusionment, and smotes Moses and all his followers into pillars of dust that would cry for their petty lives but can't, having recently been turned into dust and all, you will see! You will see this very night!	['jewbilee']

All	1	0	O...	[]
Elder Garth	29	2	Stupid assholes. Moses ain't gonna teach them anything!  Do not fear, Haman. This night shall be yours, and the anti-Semitic Jews will once again rule the Earth.	['assholes', 'jews']
Squirt leader	77	0	We are Squirts, we are Squirts; we're so kosher that it hurtsWhen we get older we'll be Scouts, but until then we are Squirts There he is, Squirts.  Okay, Squirts. Remember the plan: immobilize and attack. Matthew, y-you immobilize the bear with the net, then Echo team, run up and attack it with your Squirt knives.

Kyle	4	0	It's a duck.	[]
Elder Garth	32	0	And it was foretold that the spirit of Moses would finally rest when his spirit was imprisoned by Haman in a conch shell of blind faith. Conch shell, like this one, hnee.	[]
Chief elder	31	1	Moses, the Squirts have made you tidings of macaroni pictures. They should be here any second.  Where the hell are the Squirts?  We need those macaroni pictures for Moses right now!	['hell']
Squirt leader	56	1	Now, we'll just see how Mr. Bear likes rat poison.  Well now, that'll be enough to kill a stupid bear. Okay, raise the tray!  Chutzpah badge, here I come.  Yikes!  Okay, here he comes. Easy now. Easy, Squirts.  Okay, Squirt, lower the tray.  That's it. That's it, you god-damned stupid bearface!	['damned']

Moses	4	0	I desire... popcorn necklaces.	[]
Chief elder	21	0	You heard him. Get to making popcorn necklaces right away!  All you need is some popcorn, and a needle and thread.	[]
Moses	5	0	Hold!  There is... an impurity.	[]
Garth	8	0	Oh no, he's on to me, Haman.	[]
Chief elder	3	0	An impurity, Moses?	[]
Moses	6	0	This child here is not kosher.	[]
Kenny	10	0	(Uh-oh.)  (Help me, Kyle! What are we gonna do?)	[]
Kyle	8	0	Don't worry. I know what to do.	[]
Chief elder	14	2	Scout Broflovski, have you defiled Jew Scouts by bringing a non-Hebrew to Jewbilee?!	['jew', 'jewbilee']
Kyle	12	1	Elder, It's not my fault. He told me he was Jewish.	['jewish']
Kenny	1	0	(What?!)	[]
Chief elder	19	2	A non-Jew has infiltrated Jew Scouts and looked upon the face of Moses! He must be dealt with!	['jew', 'jew']
Kenny	24	0	(I'm telling you, it's Kyle you want. He's the one who tried to get me in here, and you know it.)	[]

Elder Carn	8	1	He saved us. He saved all the Jews.	['jews']
Kyle	46	1	You know, I think we all learned something today. It's fine to have your own beliefs and your own traditions, but as soon as you start excluding people from your ways, only because of their race, you become separatists. And being a separatist sucks ass.	['ass']
Elder Harris	12	0	We've learned a lot from you and your great friend, Kenny.	[]
