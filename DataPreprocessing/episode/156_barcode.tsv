Mrs. Garrison	24	0	All right, students, let's take our seats. Apparently we have a little problem here at the school which we need to talk about.	[]
Cartman	20	1	Ah yes. You mean the Jew problem.  Good, good! I'm glad we're finally gonna do something about it.	['jew']
Mrs. Garrison	29	0	No, I mean the problem of head lice.  There's been a lice breakout at a school in Denver, and we need to make sure nobody spreads it here.	[]
Bebe	4	0	Somebody might have lice?	[]
Class	1	0	Ewww!	[]
Mrs. Garrison	14	0	So today you're all going to the gymnasium to have your scalps examined.	[]
Cartman	25	0	Uh th-that is completely unnecessary. Everyone knows that only poor people can get lice. The only person that can spread it here is Kenny.	[]
Kenny	3	1	(What? Fuck you!)	['fuck']
Mrs. Garrison	34	0	I'm sure this class is clean, but we're gonna be examined so that if anyone has the lice, we can stop it before it spreads.  Lice can live in anybody's hair.	[]
Male Louse	6	0	Hello, Kelly. How's my babih?	[]
Kelly	7	0	You mean me or the little one?	[]
Male Louse	3	0	I mean both.	[]
Kelly	17	0	Well, besides a little loneliness waiting for Daddy to come home, I guess we're both okay.	[]
Male Louse	15	0	How did a louse like me get so lucky to have a louse like you?	[]
Kelly	10	0	Luck had nothing to do with it, Travis.  You okay?	[]
Travis	38	0	Sometimes... I just worry what kind of world our babih is gonna grow up in.  I need to run up to the forest and do another sediment analysis. I'm worried we might be overworking the tertiary layer.	[]
Lead Screener	33	0	All students, make sure you're in line according to your grade. When you reach the front of the line you will go behind the curtain and remove any hats to be checked.	[]
Butters	12	0	Boy, I sure hope they don't find lice in my hair.	[]
Stan	10	0	What do you think happens if you do have it?	[]
Cartman	33	2	They drag you out of here, put you in this big containment facility, where they stick a cold metal pipe up your ass with this clear jelly, and then they shock your balls.	['ass', 'balls']
Craig	12	0	I'm clean! I knew I didn't have any stupid lice!	[]
Cartman	17	0	This is ridiculous. All this just so they can send Kenny and his stupid head lice home.	[]
Kenny	3	1	(Hey! Fuck off!)	['fuck']
Lead Screener	6	0	Have a seat on the stool.	[]
Lead Screener	8	0	Uh oh, looks like you've got 'em.	[]
Clyde	1	0	What?	[]
Lead Screener	10	0	You have lice. Let's see... Clyde Harris, is it?	[]
Clyde	6	0	Oh my God. Oh Christ no!	[]
Lead Screener	19	0	Now now, it's all right. We're going to call your parents and get you to your doctor.	[]
Clyde	16	0	Please, ya-you don't understand. The other kids are gonna make fun of me forever!	[]
Lead Screener	9	0	I'm sure your friends aren't that cruel.	[]
Clyde	3	0	Yes they are!	[]
Travis	26	0	Mr. President! Mr. President! I believe we have a serious problem!  The environment... is changing. I believe it is somehow, reacting to our presence on it.	[]
President	7	0	And what do you base this on?	[]
Travis	32	0	Look, this is the world, right? But now, think of the world as... a living being.  If it were somehow conscious, then it would ultimately become aware of our effect on it.	[]
Older Louse	12	0	Huh right, the world is conscious. It makes perfect sense.  Hello. Anybody?	[]
Travis	35	0	If we have made too much of an impact, then that consciousness would try to snuff us out! I think we're looking at a global catastrophe, the likes of which we've never seen!	[]
Older Louse	3	0	Poodiggery and poppycock!	[]
Travis	19	0	I think we need to put all resources now into a full investigation, perhaps even begin a licewide evacuation.	[]
Older Louse	27	0	Evacuation?! Tomorrow is the Gootack Festival. Do you know how much money we would lose? Escort Mr. Mayfield out. The President can't be bothered any further.	[]
Travis	11	1	Damn you Vice President Craig! You could be killin' us all!	['damn']
Clyde	4	0	This is so... embarrassing.	[]
Girl	12	0	I have an ear infection. What are you seeing the doctor for?	[]
Clyde	5	0	I have... I have AIDS.	[]
Nurse	2	0	Clyde Harris?	[]
Doctor	17	0	Yeeaahh, that's a pretty bad lice problem there. Good thing they pulled you out of school.	[]
Clyde	11	0	But why me, doctor? Why me?! How did I get this?!	[]
Doctor	44	0	Well, believe it or not, some lice can actually attach themselves to flies, and then wait for the fly to land on someone's head where they can reproduce. And then the lice that live in your head now were probably all born there.	[]
Clyde	1	0	...Sick!	[]
Doctor	28	0	This shampoo should take care of it.  Use this in the shower. Your scalp may burn a bit afterwards, but... it should kill... every last one of them.	[]
Kelly	3	0	Travis? Everything okay?	[]
Travis	14	0	Kelly, I was just thinkin' about our babih. I want to name her... Hope.	[]
Kelly	1	0	Hope?	[]
Travis	6	0	Hope for a... chance at tomorrow?	[]
Louse 1	4	0	It's raining? Now?	[]
Louse 2	5	0	Woohoo! I love the rain!	[]
Travis	10	0	Oh my God.  We have to get out of here!	[]
Kelly	6	0	What it, it's just rain.	[]
Travis	9	0	We have to get out of here now, Kellih!	[]
Louse 3	3	0	What is that?	[]
Lice	2	0	Whoa!  Ruuun!	[]
Travis	15	0	Everyone get up into the trees! We have to get up high! Come on, Kelly!	[]
Kelly	7	0	My God, Travis, they're all dying!	[]
Travis	7	0	Don't look, Kelly! Don't look!	[]
Louse 4	5	1	What the hell is it?!	['hell']
Louse 5	9	0	Well it's okay, we're safe up here!	[]
Travis	5	0	I don't think so!	[]
Louse 4	1	0	OoOhOOOoooh!	[]
Kelly	1	0	Travis!	[]
Travis	3	0	Kellih! Hang on!	[]
Kelly	5	0	I can't... hang on!	[]
Travis	6	0	You have to! For the babih!	[]
Kelly	1	0	Nooooooooooo!	[]
Travis	3	0	Kehhhllihhhh! No! Noooo!	[]
Mrs. Garrison	21	0	Okay, kids, today we're going to review some Civil War history. Who can tell me what year the war started?	[]
Cartman	6	0	Waiwaiwait, whoa whoa, so what happened?	[]
Mrs. Garrison	2	0	With what?	[]
Craig	10	0	With the lice exam. Did they find anybody with lice?	[]
Mrs. Garrison	13	0	Y-yes, some lice was discovered and the proper action has been taken.	[]
Stan	4	0	Somebody in this class?	[]
Mrs. Garrison	2	0	Uh, yes.	[]
Class	1	0	Ohhhhh.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Well who was it?  It was Kenny, right?	[]
Mrs. Garrison	7	0	That doesn't matter, it's over.	[]
Cartman	21	0	Doesn't matter?! If somebody had parasites in their hair, we need to know who!  It was Kenny, wasn't it?	[]
Red	7	0	I wanna know who it was, too.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	29	0	It's being kept confidential! There's a policy in the schools not to single out a kid who has lice, because of the embarrassment it can cause, okay?!	[]
Cartman	25	1	That is bullcrap! You are denying our rights as children to totally rip on that kid and make him or her feel like an outcast!	['bullcrap']
Class	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Bebe	23	0	And we have a right to know which boy had lice in his hair so we don't ever go out with them!	[]
Craig	19	0	How do we know it was a boy? It could just have easily been one of you stupid girls!	[]
Butters	3	0	Yeah! Dumb girls!	[]
Mrs. Garrison	23	0	The case is closed! Whoever had the lice, they're dead now! We're moving on to Civil War history.  Ulysses S. Grant-	[]
Travis	8	0	Hope. Hope, you're alive.  My God...  Heh?!	[]
Louse 6	4	0	Help me... Help meeee...	[]
Louse 7	21	0	Travis.  Over here! Travis, if you hadn't warned us to get up in them trees, we'd all be dead.	[]
Travis	3	0	How many survivors?	[]
Louse 7	9	0	Just the six of us. And the Vice President.	[]
Travis	28	1	You son of a bitch! You had a chance to stop this! So help me, if we live through this, I'm gonna see you rot in prison!	['bitch']
Louse 8	5	0	What do we do now?	[]
Travis	24	0	We aren't out of this yet! You two look for other survivors. You get whatever food you can and bring it back here.	[]
Vice President	5	0	Who put you in charge?!	[]
Travis	7	0	God did! When he killed my wife!	[]
Cartman	23	0	All right, the person who had head lice needs to speak up right now, so that we know to stay away from you!	[]
Craig	11	0	Yeah, come on! We're gonna find out sooner or later.	[]
Cartman	23	0	Okay, whoever you are, you are now not only a licehead, you're a liar! You're only making this worse on yourself!	[]
Kyle	9	0	You know what? I'll bet it was you!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Me?!	[]
Kyle	29	0	This is exactly what you would do if they found lice in your hair! Try to lead the charge against somebody else to take the suspicion off of yourself!	[]
Cartman	30	0	I don't think so, Kyle! But you know what?! This is exactly what you would do if you had had head lice! Try to get everyone to blame me!	[]
Stan	10	0	You guys stop it! This isn't getting us anywhere!	[]
Cartman	14	0	That's exactly what you would do if you had had head lice, Stan.	[]
Kyle	16	0	Yeah, try to have everyone make peace so it doesn't seem like a big deal.	[]
Cartman	13	0	And this is exactly what Kenny would do: stand here and say nothing!	[]
Butters	7	0	Heh hey guys, what would I do?	[]
Bebe	13	0	Let's just get a magnifying glass and look at everyone's heads.	[]
Kyle	11	0	It's too late. The treatment would have killed it all.	[]
Clyde	14	0	Well I guess we're never gonna know. There's no way to tell.	[]
Cartman	23	1	There's a way! There's a way to find out who had sick-ass head cooties! And I'm gonna find it!	['ass']
Kyle	9	0	It was him. It had to have been him!	[]
Stan	3	0	Yeah... Or you.	[]
Louse 9	7	0	Mark? Mark, you have to hang on.	[]
Travis	23	0	This isn't going to stop. The world is rejecting us! If we're gonna live, we have to get off this planet.	[]
Louse 8	1	0	How?	[]
Travis	24	0	First we have to get out of the forest, into the forbidden zone. It's the only way we might even see another planet!	[]
Louse 9	12	0	The forbidden zone... We'll be exposed. We'll die out there.	[]
Travis	17	0	We'll die here! Look, the world is getting rid of us! Don't you get it?!	[]
Louse 10	14	0	Getting rid of us? You-you mean like it knows what it's doing?	[]
Travis	10	0	Yes! Because maybe we rolled the dice too many times!	[]
Louse 9	6	0	I'm not leaving my husband.	[]
Louse 11	8	0	Yeah huh-I'll take my chances here.	[]
Travis	13	0	You can all stay here; I'm gonna try to save my babih.	[]
Louse 12	12	0	I'll go with you. There's nothing left for me here.	[]
Vice President	4	0	I wanna go too.	[]
Travis	3	0	Not a chance.	[]
Vice President	29	0	Look, I know I messed up, all right? But I think you're right. If we can get out of the forest, we might find another place to live.	[]
Travis	27	0	If we find anything, we'll try to send help for the rest of you.  Let's go.  Come on if you're comin' Mister Vice President!	[]
Vice President	4	0	Yeah. Right behind you.	[]
Cartman	6	0	All right, lock that door, Craig!	[]
Kyle	5	0	What's this about, Cartman?	[]
Cartman	87	0	I've come up with a test that can determine if it was any of us who had the head lice.  We're gonna find out once and for all who had head cooties.  Lice feed on a person's blood, and just like mosquitoes they leave small traces of their saliva in the host's bloodstream. That saliva, is monochromagnic. So if an infected person's blood is touched by... this hot metal coil, say... that person's blood will jump 10 meters into the air.	[]
Jimmy	5	0	Ur ur re- ur really?	[]
Kyle	20	1	That's retarded! You didn't come up with that experiment, Cartman, you saw it in that movie, The Thing!	['retarded']
Cartman	7	0	This is a scientific test, designed to-	[]
Kyle	13	0	You saw it in The Thing and you're wasting everyone's time!	[]
Cartman	18	0	I thought you might say that, Kyle. Because you don't want to take the test, do you?!	[]
Kyle	11	0	Nobody's blood is going to jump up in the air!	[]
Cartman	41	0	If it isn't going to work, then what are you afraid of? The only person who wouldn't want to take the test is somebody who was worried it might work and reveal that they were the ones with lice!	[]
Craig	4	0	Yeah. That's true.	[]
Jimmy	14	0	I have no problem taking the test. I have nothing to hi-huhiii-hide	[]
Token	3	0	Yeah. Me neither.	[]
Kyle	9	0	All right, fine. I'll do the dumb test.	[]
Cartman	22	0	Everyone take a Petri dish and a syringe. We need at least 30 cc's of blood from each one of you.	[]
Cartman	15	0	All right, now everyone back over there!  We'll start with what I already know.	[]
Butters	12	0	Well, guess that proves Eric wasn't the one with head lice.	[]
Kyle	5	0	It doesn't prove anything!	[]
Cartman	16	0	Yeah? Let's just see what your blood does, Kyle!  Huh, I guess you're clean.	[]
Clyde	11	0	Ye-you guys, we'd better go. Recess is almost over.	[]
Cartman	13	0	It's all right, it won't take much longer, just-AHH AHHGH!	[]
Token	3	1	What the hell?!	['hell']
Cartman	1	0	Kenny!	[]
Kyle	2	0	No way.	[]
Craig	9	0	You were right all along, Eric. It was Kenny.	[]
Cartman	13	0	Of course I was right! I told you only poor people get lice!	[]
Louse 12	23	0	We've done it. We've reached the forbidden zone.  I've always heard stories about this place. Never thought it was real.	[]
Travis	11	0	It's real. Real as my love for my unborn babih.	[]
Vice President	7	0	So what exactly is your plan, Travis?	[]
Travis	40	0	Our ancestors came here from another world. Maybe there's still other worlds out there with life forms like us. Maybe there's even a world where they've learned to live with the planet instead of just on it.	[]
Louse 12	22	0	Travis. Travis, you're, so wise, so strong. If we make it out of this, I'd like to... be with you.	[]
Travis	15	0	Sorry, babe, but my heart is forever stenciled in permanent ink with the name  Kelly.	[]
Louse 12	8	0	She was a lucky woman to have you.	[]
Travis	7	0	Luck had nothin' to do with it.	[]
Vice President	6	0	Sorry to cut the honeymoon short!	[]
Travis	4	1	Why you murdering bastard!	['bastard']
Vice President	9	0	Your little fantasy of another world ends here! Walk!	[]
Travis	8	1	What the hell do you want, Vice President?!	['hell']
Vice President	1	0	Walk!	[]
Craig	19	0	Clyde, dude, get down to the park. We caught Kenny, and we're all gonna let him have it!	[]
Clyde	8	0	What? What are you gonna do to him?	[]
Cartman	30	0	He lied to us all! He betrayed his kind! We all know what has to happen.  Grab a sock and a bar of soap, and meet us at the park!	[]
Clyde	3	0	You guys, wait.	[]
Cartman	2	0	What, Clyde?	[]
Clyde	2	0	I... nothing.	[]
Cartman	17	0	All right, see you there!  Remember, bar of soap and a sock! Kenny's gonna get it!	[]
"Token, Craig"	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Jimmy	9	1	Yeah! We're gonna fu-fu-fuck him up!	['fuck']
Mrs. Garrison	1	0	Yello?	[]
Clyde	19	0	Mrs. Garrison, one of your students is about to be attacked at the park by all the other students.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	10	0	What? Who's going to get attacked? Who is this?!	[]
Clyde	11	0	Please just hurry to the park! You have to stop them!	[]
Vice President	7	0	That's good! That's far enough!	[]
Travis	6	0	What are you going to do?	[]
Vice President	17	0	I'm gonna go back to the village, start to rebuild, mate with the females, become... President!	[]
Travis	21	0	Don't you get it? The world doesn't want you here! It's not gonna stop until you're dead!	[]
Vice President	6	0	It was a disaster! Disasters happen!	[]
Travis	12	0	Then go ahead and die there, I'm leavin' with my babih!	[]
Vice President	8	0	Actually, you're never leaving here either, Travis!	[]
Travis	3	1	Damn you! Why?!	['damn']
Vice President	43	0	Because when I'm President, I can't have pests like you constantly trying to preach that the world is alive! You're an idealistic fool! The world is not conscious, we are conscious! If the world was alive, it would feel this!	[]
Clyde	1	0	Ow.	[]
Vice President	3	0	You die he-	[]
Cartman	24	1	Kenny McCormick, you are charged with bringing head cooties into our school, and lying about it to cover your ass! How do you plead?!	['ass']
Kenny	2	0	(Not guilty!)	[]
Cartman	4	0	Guilty! I thought so!	[]
Craig	6	0	All right, let's do this!	[]
Clyde	11	0	You guys, maybe we should just... wait a few more minutes?	[]
Cartman	24	0	All right, Kenny. You know what has to happen! Sock bath! Everyone wash Kenny with the soap and dry him off with the socks!	[]
Kenny	7	0	Nohoho! No, not the socks! Ahhhgh, stop!	[]
Clyde	2	0	Wait, wait!	[]
Kyle	13	0	Wait... stop it, stop it!  I can't let Kenny be sock-dried.	[]
Craig	8	0	He had cooties and he lied about it!	[]
Kyle	12	0	Kenny didn't have the head lice, all right?!  It was me.	[]
Clyde	1	0	What?	[]
Kyle	22	0	I was the one. I was too afraid to say anything, but I can't let Kenny be sock-bathed for it.	[]
Stan	36	0	Why are you saying that, Kyle? You can't be the one who had head lice.  Because I was. You're just trying to make me feel bad because you figured that out, didn't you?!	[]
Clyde	6	0	Wait a-wait a minute, what?	[]
Cartman	26	0	Oh I get it.  This is some kind of big trick on me! You've known I was the one with head lice all along, huh?!	[]
Stan	4	0	You had head lice?	[]
Cartman	16	1	Of course! Why do you think I went through that elaborate bullcrap experiment to frame Kenny?!	['bullcrap']
Mrs. Garrison	22	1	You all had head lice!  Every single person in the class! The boys aaand the girls! Lice spreads fast, you dumb-asses!	['asses']
Craig	7	0	I thought I was the only one.	[]
Butters	2	0	Me too.	[]
Cartman	10	0	But that means... that means Kenny was lying! Sock bath!	[]
Kenny	1	0	Dudes!	[]
Travis	36	0	Kellih. Kellih, can you hear mih? I don't know if you can. But... I wanted you to know I tried. I tried to save our babih. But I let you down, babe.  Keh... k-Kellih?	[]
Louse 13	19	0	You are welcome here.  You're safe now. We've lived here for generation after generation, never being disturbed.	[]
Travis	9	0	Heh. We made it, Hope. We made it, Kellih!	[]
Agent	6	0	Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Angelina Jolie!	[]
Angelina Jolie	3	0	Hello everyone!  Hello!	[]
