Deckhand	1	0	Aaaaah!	[]
Cartman	12	0	He did what?? He flew down in a parachute and did what??	[]
Clyde	27	0	Apparently, he stopped Microsoft from blockading the shipment of PS4s to the mall. Looks like he's all over the place winning the console wars for Sony.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Because, because what? Because he's cute?	[]
Kyle	14	0	Cartman, he's got everyone on Sony's side. We can't stop him!	[]
Cartman	10	0	But what does he do besides that he's cute?!	[]
Liane	9	0	Sweetie, Bill Gates is on the phone for you.	[]
Cartman	34	2	Tell Bill Gates to suck my ass, Mom!__Mom?__Don't seriously tell Bill Gates to suck my ass. Tell him everything's cool and I'll call him in a little bit._	['ass', 'ass']
Kyle	18	0	This would have never happened if you would have let Kenny be a princess in the first place!	[]
Cartman	9	0	He's not a princess, he's a DUDE!	[]
Kyle	16	0	Well, unfortunately for us, he's now on the other side! We are out of options!	[]
Cartman	6	0	So what are you saying, Kyle?!	[]
Kyle	19	0	I have an idea.__I don't like it, but I think it's the only choice we have.	[]
Niles	75	0	Tom, Black Friday is finally almost here, and as you can see behind me, holiday shoppers are really getting antsy. People have been waiting out here since midnight on Thanksgiving. They're cold, they're starving, and there's already been a lot of blood shed over these holiday deals. Joining me now is Rick Tellmore,__who's been out here for six days, and= your five year old son was eaten. Is that correct?	[]
Rick	28	0	Yes, yes that's right, we had to eat him. We were all sort of starving out here, so we drew straws, and he drew the shortest one.	[]
Niles	14	0	What is it you're hoping to get when Black Friday does finally start?	[]
Rick	16	0	A a Blu-ray player. Ninety-six percent off, it's gonna be about 20 bucks.	[]
Niles	19	0	Now, some people might say that eating your child is not very Christmasy. What would you say to them?	[]
Rick	49	11	Iiii... ate my son for a Blu-ray play-er With a ho ho ho and a jingle jingle jang-le My son got ate and it tasted good ho ho jingle jingle ho ho!  Ho ho jingle jing-le Jingle jingle jang-le Jingle jingle jingle ho ho!	['ho', 'ho', 'ho', 'ho', 'ho', 'ho', 'ho', 'ho', 'ho', 'ho', 'ho']
Niles	16	0	No doubt Christmas is alive and well at the South Park Mall. Back to you, Tom.	[]
Stan	51	0	Alright, guys, here's the deal: the main entrance to the mall is already blocked by thousands of waiting shoppers. The kids who want XBoxes plan to flank from the left, here.__Our best chance of being first inside is finding a way to the mall's back entrance, here._	[]
Craig	3	0	At Red Robin?	[]
Jimmy	17	0	That's right. Red Robin has doors on the inside that go right out into the mall.	[]
Stan	19	0	The key to us being the first ones inside is taking over the Red Robin before Black Friday starts.	[]
Craig	8	0	So how do we take over Black Robin?	[]
Stan	4	0	I have no idea.	[]
Pete	4	0	Hey uh, excuse me?	[]
Stan	1	0	Yes?	[]
Pete	13	0	The uh, XBox fighters are here and they say they wanna switch sides?	[]
Stan	2	0	What?_	[]
Kyle	6	0	Go ahead and tell him, Cartman.	[]
Cartman	19	0	Alright. on behalf of the XBox fighters of Zaron we hereby lay down our arms and give up, okay?	[]
Craig	1	0	Haha.	[]
Cartman	42	0	Shut up, Craig! This is very difficult! You guys win, alright?! We'll all play on PlayStation 4s! We still think XBox is the superior machine, but you got too many people on your side, and then Kenny became a Japanese princess.	[]
Clyde	4	0	Nobody saw that coming.	[]
Kyle	33	0	Look, the truth is, we all have a bigger problem now, and you know it. Nobody is going to get anything if we don't work together against those thousands of other shoppers.	[]
Stan	20	0	So, better a PS4 than nothing, is that it? I think we'll take our chances on our own._	[]
Cartman	36	0	We know a way inside the Red Robin.__You don't think you're the only ones that thought of it. We were going to use the Red Robin entrance too, and we figured out how.	[]
Kyle	26	0	Red Robin can be rented out, for wedding parties. If we all chip in we can pay for the deposit to have the wedding party there.	[]
Craig	4	0	Hey, that could work.	[]
Kyle	30	0	Let's do this together, dude.__Our only shot at playing any next-gen console is by teaming up. If you wanna game on a PS4, then I do too.	[]
Stan	20	0	And you swear you'll be okay with that? You won't talk about the XBox being better ever again?	[]
Kyle	3	0	I swear, Stan.	[]
Stan	11	0	Alright, guys. Looks like we have a wedding to plan._	[]
Sony President	7	0	Taihen. Kono console warusu mada owaranai._	[]

Kenny	5	0	Purincessu Kenni daijobu dayo!_	[]
The Office	3	0	Ahh, kawaii!_	[]
Cartman	13	0	Sir Stan, I was hoping I could talk to you about the wedding.	[]
Stan	5	0	Yeah, sure, what about it?	[]
Cartman	25	0	I think it's best that when the time comes for the mall to open, we should stay back a bit from the doors._	[]
Stan	1	0	Why?	[]
Cartman	44	0	Well, think about it.__The first people inside are gonna have to take on the brunt of the holiday shoppers from the main entrance. It's best we let Butters and Scott Malkinson go first. While they fight, we can simply slip on by.	[]
Stan	19	0	Oh, okay I guess that makes sense, but... Butters and Scott won't be able to get their PS4s.	[]
Cartman	29	0	Yes, that's true, but, let's face Sir Stan. This is all about you and me getting PlayStations. The rest are simply there to help us... get through-	[]
Homeowner	20	0	He's lying to you!__They're just acting like they've given up, but it's a double-bluff!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Dude! Dude!	[]
Homeowner	17	0	They're gonna betray you at the Red Robin wedding! He got the idea watching_Game of Thrones!	[]
Cartman	5	1	Dude, shut the fuck up!	['fuck']
Stan	3	0	Who is that?	[]
Cartman	20	0	He's just this old crazy guy who gets pissed off because I'm in his garden all the time.	[]
Homeowner	6	0	They're gonna lock you in!	[]
Cartman	5	1	God damn it, shut up!	['damn']
Homeowner	39	0	He talked about it in my garden to like three other people! They're gonna lock you in the Red Robin and go get all the XBoxes! That's why he wants you to stay back from the doors!	[]
Cartman	25	0	Well why don't you just tell the whole world everything, huh?! Why don't you tell everyone what_Prometheus_was about while you're at it?!	[]
Stan	5	0	Did Kyle know about this?	[]
Cartman	24	0	Dude, we're not gonna betray you. Come on! Did you see_Prometheus? I don't think the writers even knew what that was about.	[]
Stan	5	0	Did Kyle know about this?!	[]
Cartman	19	3	Kyle thought of it.__Stan, dude, hold on! XBox One is fuckin' sweet, dude!__You're a fuckin' asshole!	['fuckin', 'fuckin', 'asshole']
Homeowner	7	1	Fuck you, get out of my garden!	['fuck']
Cartman	7	2	I'll shit in your fuckin' garden!	['shit', 'fuckin']
Homeowner	4	1	Go fuck yourself!_	['fuck']
Tammy	11	0	Well, the wait is over and Black Friday is finally here.	[]
Tom	12	0	Niles Lawson is at the scene, and it's about time, Niles.	[]
Niles	71	0	That's right Tom. Mall officials have said they are ready, and doors will open as soon as their guest of honor cuts the ceremonial red ribbon.__This year's ribbon cutter is of course George R. R. Martin, who um, doesn't appear to have shown up yet,__but uhh, says he is on his way. Just like the dragons and zombies in his novels, he is on his way.	[]
Butters	22	0	Now just hold on a minute! Well I'm pretty darned sure the fastest way back to Colorado isn't on horseback!	[]
GRRM	18	0	That may be true, but horses have one quality that is unmatched by any other mode of transportation.	[]
Butters	5	0	What's that?__Awww!_	[]
Cartman	26	0	Okay, cool, could we set up the two long tables here, like, facing each other, and then another one for the bride and groom back there?	[]
Manager	15	0	Uh, I heard a rumor. May I ask, who is it that's getting married?	[]
Cartman	6	0	Oh uum, Tom Hanks aaand Beyonce.	[]
Manager	15	0	It's, it's real? It's for real? Oho my God, I love them!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Yesh, kewl.	[]
Manager	8	0	So Beyonce is not with Jay-Z anymore?	[]
Cartman	15	0	Well, clearly she wouldn't be marrying Tom Hanks at Red Robin if she was.	[]
Manager	14	0	Uh, guys, guys, not those tables. Get the good tables. This is VIP, okay?	[]
Cartman	12	1	Has anyone heard from Butters and Scott Malkinson? The fuck are they?	['fuck']
Kyle	12	0	Cartman, Cartman! I heard that Stan somehow found out about our plan!	[]
Cartman	3	0	Yes, he did.	[]
Kyle	13	1	Well what the hell are you doing?! This isn't gonna work now!	['hell']
Cartman	19	0	It's fine, Kyle. Everything's been taken care of. Stan won't be telling anybody anything... ever again.	[]
Kyle	6	1	What the hell did you do??	['hell']
Cartman	15	0	What had to be done so that we can play our games on XBoxes, Kyle!	[]
Kyle	6	0	No. Tell me you didn't!	[]
Sharon	19	0	He's not allowed to come out of his room, so you can talk to him through the door.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Thanks, Mrs. Marsh.	[]
Sharon	18	0	And keep it short. He's in real trouble. He defecated in a nice old man's garden.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Ok-okay.__Stan? Stan?	[]
Stan	6	0	Huh? Hello? Who is that?_	[]
Kyle	4	0	Stan, it's me.	[]
Stan	4	0	Get out of here!	[]
Kyle	33	0	Dude, I know you're pissed at me right now. You've gotta understand that I did it because I know in my heart that the XBox is better, for all of us.	[]
Stan	11	0	You completely betrayed the last bit of friendship we still had.	[]
Kyle	19	0	You weren't playing fair, dude. Getting your dad to work part time at the mall wasn't fair.	[]
Stan	12	0	I didn't even know he was working at the mall, Kyle!	[]
Kyle	3	0	You didn't?	[]
Stan	23	0	...But you couldn't just ask me. Because XBox people... don't care about the truth. They just care about seamless multimedia connectivity.	[]
Kyle	32	0	I'm sorry, Stan. I'm sorry. This whole war has just got us all so screwed up. I just want us to be playing Call of Duty on the right machine.	[]
Stan	14	0	You don't understand. I'm never playing Call of Duty with you again.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Stan, don't say that.	[]
Stan	20	0	Get out of here! I'm done with you!__Mom! Mom!__Get him out of here!__Get him out!_	[]
Randy	76	0	Now listen up: there are only eight of us now. Peterson was a great guy, and he did_not_deserve to get beheaded like that. Now I don't know about you, but I am sick and tired of getting to know people here, getting invested in their personalities and their back stories, and then having them die!__When those doors open, we all stick together! If anyone panics, it puts us all at risk!__Stay tough, rookie.	[]
Guard 6	7	0	We're not gonna make it, sir.	[]
Randy	28	0	We're gonna make it! You've got a newborn little girl who needs her daddy to make it! I'm not going to let you die, okay?!	[]
Guard 6	1	0	Okay.	[]
Randy	1	0	OKAY?!	[]
Guard 6	4	0	Yes sir! Yes sir.	[]
Randy	10	0	Not one more good person dies on my watch!_	[]
Guard 3	3	0	Oh my God!	[]
Guard 8	7	0	They're comin' in through the roof!	[]
Guard 6	14	0	I can't do this! I'm sorry! I can't do this!_	[]
Randy	11	0	Stay at your post!__Nooo! NOOO! EVERYBODY REALLY LIKED HIM!! NOOO!	[]
Niles	17	0	Here we go, Tom. George R. R. Martin has finally arrived to cut the red ribbon._	[]
GRRM	32	0	Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor to be here this morning on behalf of South Park Mall Partners and channel 9 News, your go-to source for news, weather, and sports.	[]
Shopper 8	4	0	Just do it!_	[]
GRRM	29	1	Very well. In the tradition of our ancestors,__let's bring in the holidays!__But first, I'd like to share with you a few words about my wiener.	['wiener']
Crowd	2	0	AAAWWWW!!_	[]
Manager	12	0	Hey, sorry guys. Red Robin is closed for a special event today.	[]
Pete	8	0	Yeah, we know. We're with the wedding.	[]
Manager	7	0	Oh great, go right on in._	[]
Cartman	69	2	Everyone! Everyone, a Black Friday toast. How awesome that we are all friends again. Our two houses brought together. Soon we will all have our PlayStation 4s.__And to you, my old friend, Princess Kenny. You really look stunning. No doubt the gods have smiled down upon your perky boobs.__Now, if you'll excuse my, my lady, I need to take a shit.__What have you found out?	['boobs', 'shit']
Clyde	19	0	The mall isn't open yet. They're waiting for George R. R. Martin to come cut the ribbon.	[]
Cartman	41	1	Oh okay, that could be a while.__All our men are ready. When the mall opens, blow the whistle. We'll rush through the doors and lock the Sony dorks inside. Alright, now I really do need to take a shit.	['shit']
GRRM	15	0	O soft and pink with purple head.Gently you lay with me on my bed.	[]
Shopper 9	9	0	Get on with it, George R. R. Martin!_	[]
GRRM	18	2	Growl, growl calls the wiener from on high A little tiny wiener, still so pleasing to the eye.	['wiener', 'wiener']
Shopper 10	5	1	Enough with the wieners already!	['wieners']
Shopper 11	3	0	Yeah, come on!	[]
Cartman	7	1	Clyde? Where the hell is Clyde? Clyde?	['hell']
Kyle	14	0	Princess Kenny, I believe it's time we returned the Wizard's hospitality!_	[]
Cartman	5	1	What the hell is this?!	['hell']
Kyle	12	0	I'm sorry, Cartman. There's been a little change in plans!	[]
Cartman	13	0	Sir Kyle, they're about to open the mall! What are you doing?!	[]
Kyle	21	0	I am no longer an XBox guy! I let my friend get grounded, but today I will give him a PlayStation!	[]
Cartman	9	0	Kyle, the PlayStation controller sucks and you know it!	[]
Kyle	5	0	The fight is over, Cartman!	[]
Gates	11	0	It's not over. Looks like I came just in time.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Oho! Bill Gates! Sweet! In your face, Kyle!	[]
Sony President	14	0	You will not interfere, Bill Gates! These-a children will get their PS4s!_	[]
Kyle	14	1	Wait a minute. Ha-how the hell did these two guys end up here?	['hell']
Cartman	8	0	They're not a part of your betrayal?	[]
Kyle	9	0	No. They're not a part of your betrayal?	[]
Cartman	6	0	No. Whose betrayal is this?_	[]
Stan	14	0	We're done with betrayal! It's time to put an end to this!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Stan?	[]
Guard 3	25	0	Sir? Sir, Operations just said they need one of us to unlock the door to Red Robin to let some wedding party inside the mall!	[]
Randy	17	0	Screw them! They'll have to fend for themselves! Wait. Red Robin Wedding? Who's getting married?!	[]
Guard 3	4	0	Tom Hanks and Beyonce.	[]
Randy	15	0	What?! Oh my God, everyone likes Tom Hanks and Beyonce!__I've gotta save them!	[]
Stan	79	2	I appreciate what you're trying to do, Kyle, but I have a better idea! This isn't our war, you guys! It never was. We've been pitted against each other by two companies for the sake of marketing. That's why they want lines around the block.__Because they_want_a war to promote their products. They don't give a crap what kind of friendships they cost. You two want a war so bad?__Then you fucking fight!	['crap', 'fucking']
Sony President	2	0	Huh?__Sou...	[]

Sony President	2	0	Ikimashou!_	[]

GRRM	19	1	Look at this wiener.__Judge it by its size?Rub it three times and it has a surprise._	['wiener']
Shopper 4	14	2	That's it! You're not delaying this anymore, you wiener-loving bitch!_	['wiener', 'bitch']

Randy	9	0	Get back! Get out of my way!__Commander Marsh?	[]
Sharon	20	0	Did you know that your son is supposed to be grounded and he snuck out to go to Red Robin?!	[]
Randy	14	0	WHAT?? STAN'S IN THE RED ROBIN WEDDING TOO?? OH GOD, I_REALLY_CARE ABOUT HIM!	[]
Gates	12	0	This... is over... Now... you die!__It's over. XBox... wins!_	[]

EVGames Clerk	10	0	Happy holidays, guys. What can I interest ya in?_	[]
Cartman	8	0	We'd like to get XBox Ones please.	[]
EVGames Clerk	3	0	Good choice!_	[]
Niles	57	0	Tom, the shopping frenzy is over, and it looks like Microsoft's new XBox One is this year's hot item. No doubt this will secure its place as the go-to next-gen console. Black Friday is over. There's been death, violence, horrible human behavior... and the big winner here, decidedly, is Channel 9 News.	[]
Cartman	19	0	The interface is pretty cool. See, I told you guys, it's really a... it's a seamless interface.	[]
Stan	3	0	Yes, it is.	[]
Butters	11	0	The graphics are definitely like 10% better than the old XBox.	[]
Jimmy	10	0	Yeah that's that's that's pretty nice._	[]
Cartman	9	0	You guys wanna p-play outside or something?_	[]
Kyle	10	0	Cartman? Your side won, dude. Why are you so sad?	[]
Cartman	21	0	I just... I can't get the image of Bill Gates... bashing that guy's head apart out of my eyes.	[]
Stan	25	0	Yeah, I know what you mean. Well look, guys, XBox won the console wars, I mean, what are we gonna do? Not play video games?	[]
Cartman	37	0	The last two weeks we've been too busy to play video games and, look at what we did. There's been drama, action, romance... I mean honestly you guys, do we need video games to play?	[]
The Boys	8	0	Yeah, you're right. You make a point.	[]
Cartman	41	1	Maybe we started to rely on Microsoft and Sony so much that we forgot that all we need to play are the simplest things. Like, like this.__We could just play with this. Screw video games, dude! Who fuckin' needs them?!	['fuckin']
The Boys	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Cartman	2	1	Fuck 'em!	['fuck']
Announcer	9	0	The South Park video game, coming to stores soon!	[]
Butters	18	1	Yeah, and if you believe that I've got a big floppy wiener to dangle in your face!	['wiener']
