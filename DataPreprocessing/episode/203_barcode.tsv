Stan	3	0	Cartman, tell us.	[]

Stan	5	1	Dude, you are so retarded!	['retarded']
Cartman	13	0	Thanks, Stan, but even if I was I'd still be too rich.	[]
Kyle	9	0	How are you rich?! Your mom pays for everything!	[]
Cartman	16	0	You guys really think I could do this, don't you? You really believe in me.	[]
Kyle	9	0	I believe that you're a broke, ignorant idiot!	[]

Butters	7	0	You're givin' away all your money??	[]
Cartman	32	0	Just get rid of it Butters! Don't tell me where you spend it and don't ever let me have it back.  From this moment on, I am poor. Like Kenny.	[]
Butters	7	0	You sure you want to do this?	[]
Cartman	23	0	I told you I'm serious, Butters.  This is my shot. I'm gonna get as poor an' stupid as I possibly can.	[]

Charlie	9	0	Hey- hey, there's a hot girl over there.	[]

Woman 1	12	0	When a woman isn't feeling her freshest, she turns to Vagisil-	[]
Cartman	5	1	Aw Goddammit, another Vagisil commercial?!	['goddammit']
Woman 1	8	1	To stop feminine itching, and relieve vaginal odors.	['vaginal']
Cartman	2	1	Fucking gross!	['fucking']
Butters	6	2	All those ladies have stinky vaginas?	['stinky', 'vaginas']

Woman 2	10	0	For the freshest, cleanest feminine area, do what women do.	[]

Announcer	12	0	We're just seconds away from the start of the Denver 300.	[]
Butters	20	1	Excuse me. Mr. Evans, sir?  Your uh, your wife is on the phone and- uh, well- she just got raped.	['raped']
Dale	1	0	What?	[]
Butters	17	1	Yeah, she got, she got raped a lot and uhhh- and you gotta go talk to her.	['raped']
Dale	3	0	Oh my God!	[]
Cartman	15	0	Sweet. Nice work, Butters. Now go be my spotter so we can win this thing!	[]
Butters	8	0	Eric, are you sure you can do this?	[]
Cartman	15	0	Don't worry, Butters, I'm totally poor and stupid. I'm ready for NASCAR.	[]
Announcer	4	0	Let the race begin!	[]
Cartman	9	0	Let's go NASCAR!  I'm not moving, Butters.	[]
Butters	8	0	I think you gotta press the gas pedal.	[]
Cartman	3	0	What's that?	[]
Butters	13	0	There's like a long pedal on the floor by your right foot.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Oh okay.  Let's go NASCAR!	[]
Announcer	12	0	It looks like the Dale Evans car is going the wrong way!	[]
Cartman	3	0	Kewl, NASCAR! Sweet!	[]
Cartman	4	2	Oh, fuck my ass!	['fuck', 'ass']
Butters	1	0	Eric?	[]
Cartman	19	0	All that work... All the effort I put in... I still wasn't poor and stupid enough to win.	[]
Butters	12	0	Eric, uh you were as poor and stupid as you could be.	[]
Cartman	32	0	Don't you get it Butters?! It's never gonna happen for me! Those people are way more poor and stupid than I'll ever be. I might as well kill myself.	[]
Butters	7	0	Eric! Don't ever talk like that!	[]
Cartman	23	0	I've given away all my money! Drank enough Vagisil to kill every brain cell I have! But it still wasn't enough.	[]
Doctor	8	0	Alright Eric, we got the X-rays back.	[]
Butters	5	0	How bad is it, doctor?	[]
Doctor	36	1	He has two fractured ribs, a broken femur, torn ligaments in both knees, and a lever 2 concussion. He also appears to be developing three small vaginas in his stomach, but they are all sparkling clean.	['vaginas']
Butters	6	0	Well at least there's that.	[]
Cartman	14	0	Just pull the plug on me, doctor. I don't wanna live like this.	[]
Doctor	13	0	You aren't on life-support. Pulling a plug wouldn't do anything.	[]
Cartman	3	1	Aw donkey balls...	['balls']
Doctor	36	0	You're lucky to be alive, young man. Sneaking onto a NASCAR racetrack and hijacking a car for a joyride? That has got to be the stupidest thing I've ever heard of a kid doing!	[]
Cartman	12	0	Thanks, doc, but you aren't gonna make me feel any better.	[]
Doctor	19	1	No, really. Of all the idiotic dumb ways I've seen kids injure themselves, yours takes the retard cake!	['retard']
Butters	10	0	Did you hear that, Eric? See? You are really stupid.	[]
Cartman	15	0	Could it be I... only lost the race because I somehow wasn't poor enough?	[]
Butters	10	0	It has to be, Eric.  Eric, where are you going?	[]
Cartman	12	0	Get me my coat, Butters. We're gonna try this thing again.	[]
FOX 11 Anchor	38	0	You're watching Colorado FOX 11. Next on FOX 11 News, are NASCAR fans stupid?  Some people are starting to wonder after a NASCAR fan apparently got high on Vagisil and snuck onto the track, killing eleven people.	[]
Reporter	41	0	Tom, the NASCAR fan got into a car here on Sunday and crashed in the lake behind me. He was later found to have ingested this  Maximum Strength Vagisil. And also Vagisil medicated wipes. Making NASCAR fans look ...pretty stupid, Tom.	[]
Kenny	8	0	(No! NASCAR fans aren't stupid! Cartman is!)	[]
Reporter	18	0	The NASCAR fan vows he will try to do it again, but that this time, he'll win.	[]
Kenny	14	4	(Oh that fucking asshole!)  (Oh that fucking asshole, I'm gonna talk to him...)	['fucking', 'asshole', 'fucking', 'asshole']
Cartman	3	0	Oh hey, Kenny.	[]
Kenny	7	1	(Dude, what the fuck are you doing?!)	['fuck']
Cartman	82	0	Come in dude, I wanna show you what I've been workin' on.  Check it out. I thought I could just give all my money away and be as poor as your family, but then I realized: what do poor people do? Buy things even though they don't have money by going out and purchasing things that are 0% down and no payments for two years! That's how you people stay poor forever! Am I right? That's it, right?	[]
Kenny	3	1	(Dude, fuck you!)	['fuck']
Cartman	10	0	Kenny, I'm just trying to get good at NASCAR.	[]
Kenny	8	0	(Being poor has nothing to do with NASCAR!)	[]
Cartman	10	0	Hey, I love NASCAR just as much as you do!	[]
Kenny	5	1	(No you fucking don't!)	['fucking']
Cartman	33	0	Oh it's sooo easy for you, isn't it, Kenny?! I had to become poor all on my own, you know?! I wasn't born with a plastic spoon in my mouth!	[]
Kenny	1	0	(What?!)	[]
Cartman	51	1	I've had to go buy stuff with 0% down and no payments for two years my-self! I didn't have parents to do it for me like you do!  Look Keh- Kenny, Kenny. We shouldn't be fighting. We both love NASCAR and we're both poor as shit.	['shit']
Man	5	0	Uh, excuse me.  Eric Cartman?	[]
Cartman	1	0	Yeah?	[]
Man	13	0	My name is Geoff Hamill. I'm the founder and CEO of Vagisil.	[]
Cartman	2	0	...Uh oh.	[]
Geoff Hamill	73	0	Young man, your NASCAR stunt has brought a lot of attention to Vagisil and honestly, I don't know how to thank you. Our sales are up and women are finally realizing that their feminine odor can be treated. I first created Vagisil for my wife, Patty. She's my Muse, my flame. We realized that NASCAR can do a lot for product recognition and so, Vagisil has a little present... for you.	[]
Cartman	8	1	Awww, sweet!  No way, this is so tits!	['tits']
Geoff Hamill	12	0	Vagisil would like you to represent us in the next NASCAR race.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Dude, check it out, Kenny! My very own NASCAR!	[]
Kenny	3	1	(No fucking way!)	['fucking']
Geoff Hamill	13	0	And we've modified the cockpit to be operated properly by a child.	[]
Cartman	15	0	Aww coool, huh Kenny? Peew Peew! I got a NASCAR, Kenny!  So awesome, huh Kenny?	[]
Announcer	24	0	We are now live at the NASCAR press conference, where the drivers of Saturday's race are gearing up and taking questions from reporters.	[]
Reporter 1	13	0	So uh what's your guys' take on the track here? Any concerns?	[]
Jimmie Johnson	38	0	Well I think it's a fine track, you know. The- the techs have done a really good job of makin' sure the banks are grafted down to the right specs and there shouldn't be any problems-	[]
Cartman	34	0	Yeah, we like the track, yup. We gotta graft them banks an' specs, it's like an oval, so we're gonna drive straight and then we're gonna be turnin' to the left.	[]
Reporter 2	16	0	Uhhh they're saying hot weather tomorrow; any concerns about restrictor plate or brake plate problems?	[]
Jeff Gordon	23	0	Of course, any time you're dealin' with high humidity and temperatures you need to compensate your brake fluid, but the plates themselves-	[]
Cartman	17	0	Compensate yer blake fluid an' git yer, git yer... b-brake workin' so you can stop sometimes.	[]
"Dale Earnhardt, Jr."	12	0	Hey excuse me, who is this kid? Is he even a driver?	[]
Cartman	38	0	Ewww, bring it on, Earnhardt, you scared of the competition?! I'm just as poor an' stupid as you! I'm gonna drive and I'm gonna go fayast and I'm gonna turn to the left sometimes!	[]
Danica Patrick	11	0	Can we just, get back to the subject of racing, please?	[]
Cartman	18	2	Uh-ho! Bring it on, Danica! You dumb bitch! Think I can't steer left better than you?!	['ho', 'bitch']
Butters	5	0	You seemed really stupid, Eric.	[]
Cartman	47	1	Thanks, B-butts. I really think I can hold my own against these guys. Little worried about that Jimmie Johnson guy though; he seems dumber than spit. And that Danica Patrick chick? Phew! We're gonna need to get even poorer and stupider, Butters. Both of us.	['butts']
Tony Kornheiser	38	0	Alright, from the NFL we now turn to the world of NASCAR! People who weren't sure what to think of NASCAR are more sure today after a NASCAR driver released bigoted and ignorant statements on his podcast.	[]
Cartman	103	6	Alright, what's up NASCAR fans? I don't know about y'all, but this President Obama is pissin' me off! So I'm gonna do some dip and speak my mind. Today I'm gonna be dippin'...  Vagisil Regular Strength Anti-Itch Creme.  Oh yeah. Yeah, that's a big dipper right there. But I'm pretty pissed off at what I found out. I found out this Obama wants to put a bigger tax on gasoline!  What the fuck is up with that?! That's fuckin' gay! And he's fuckin' gay as hell!  You all know my pit boss, Butters.	['fuck', 'fuckin', 'gay', 'fuckin', 'gay', 'hell']
Butters	4	2	Obama's fuckin' gay.	['fuckin', 'gay']
Cartman	6	3	He's fuckin' gay as hell!	['fuckin', 'gay', 'hell']
Butters	3	0	Pissin' me off!	[]
Cartman	39	3	So you all be sure to catch us in our next race. We're about as poor an' stupid as they fuckin' come, so come down an' cheer for us at NASCAR on Saturday! Obama's gay as hell!	['fuckin', 'gay', 'hell']
Tony Kornheiser	23	0	Well if you ask me, that's all the proof we need that NASCAR really is just for the poor...  and the stupid.	[]
Kenny	2	1	(Fuck this!)	['fuck']
Commentator 1	16	0	The stage is set for what could be the most important race of the NASCAR year.	[]
Commentator 2	26	0	Lots of speculation and interest in the Vagisil car, driven by Eric Cartman. We are joined now by the inventor and owner of Vagisil, Geoff Hamill.	[]
Geoff	3	0	Thank you, Chris.	[]
Chris	11	0	Yeah, but why did you decide to sponsor a NASCAR driver?	[]
Geoff	56	1	Vagisil is very excited to be a part of the NASCAR phenomenon, Chris. You know, I... first created Vagisil to try and help my wife, Patty. She is my Muse, my flame. Wherever Patty goes her smile lights up the room. Her vagina, on the other hand, clears the room and makes it uninhabitable for weeks.	['vagina']
Commentator 1	20	0	Ohkay, well the race is about to start, so why don't we kick it back down to the track?	[]
Announcer	4	0	Gentlemen, start your engines!	[]
Cartman	8	0	Alright, start your engine. What's that mean?	[]
Pit Crewman	14	0	That means you flip the switch that says Engine.  Is he stupid or what?	[]
Butters	6	0	Yeah, he's a champion alright.	[]
Security Guard	22	0	Check your bag please, sir?  No, no, see, this won't do. You can't bring a sniper rifle onto the track.	[]
Kenny	3	0	(Aww, come on!)	[]
Security Guard	20	0	Look, NASCAR is trying to change its image. It's people like you that are givin' NASCAR a bad name!	[]
Kenny	5	1	(Aw come on, fuck you!)	['fuck']
Security Guard	11	0	You might be able to buy one in the gift shop.	[]
Announcer	11	0	The drivers are slowly heading out to follow the pace car.	[]
Cartman	17	0	Then I'm gonna press the gas pedal and I'm gonna go forward.  NASCAR! Yee-ah!	[]
Pit Crewman	13	0	This is just the pace lap, you don't go full speed yet!	[]
Cartman	13	0	Yeah, just the pace lap! I'm gonna hit the, hit the brake!	[]
Danica Patrick	5	1	The fuck are you doing?!	['fuck']
Cartman	14	1	Fuck you, Danica Patrick! You ain't half as dumb as me! Gas pedal!	['fuck']
Danica Patrick	5	1	Oh, son of a bitch!	['bitch']
Cartman	7	0	Woowee, ain't nobody can stop muhey!	[]
Commentator 1	20	0	And it looks like the Vagisil car has already clipped two other drivers and taken them out of the race.	[]
Chris	18	0	Yes, the other drivers are not going to be happy about this. What do you think, Mr. Hamill?	[]
Geoff Hamill	32	0	Vagisil is a company that really stands behind its product, Chris. We want women to know that Vagisil is effective, safe for use every day,  Every. Day.  Every. Day.  And available nationwide.	[]
Butters	37	0	Be careful up here about a hundred yards, Eric. There's a wrecked car on the right side.  You're gonna wanna watch for it here. You're gonna wanna watch it over on the right side.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Oh yeah, I see it.	[]
Danica Patrick	1	0	AAAAAA!	[]
Cartman	15	0	You see that? Dayanica Patrick tried to get in my way. That pisses me off!	[]
Butters	6	3	That's fuckin' gay as hell.	['fuckin', 'gay', 'hell']
Cartman	30	0	Whoop I'm comin' up on that turn thing again. I got to stayer left.  Get out of the way you idiots, I'm tryin' to win this dayum thang!	[]
Butters	9	0	There you go. You're back on the track.	[]
Cartman	15	1	I'm back own the track.  What the... Kenny! What the hell are you doing?!	['hell']
Kenny	3	0	(Stop this car!)	[]
Cartman	5	0	Get off my car, Kenny!	[]
Kenny	5	0	(Stop this car right now!)	[]
Butters	19	2	Oh man, now our friend Kenny's tryin' to break the windshield. Ain't that just gay as hell?	['gay', 'hell']
Cartman	20	0	We're tradin' paint!  Oh it's sooo easy for you, isn't it, Kenny?! I have to prove myself!	[]
Kenny	4	1	(I fucking hate you!)	['fucking']
Cartman	12	0	Sorry dude, I'm winning this race! Hit the brakes! Bye Kenny.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(AAAAAAAAAAAAAA...)	[]
Driver	10	0	Oh Jesus, there's a little boy on the track.	[]
Chris	25	0	Well it appears that all the other drivers have crashed and only the Vagisil car remains. Looks like you're going to win, Mr. Hamill.	[]
Geoff Hamill	29	0	This is such a great day for Vagisil, Chris. Our product awareness will be at an all-time high. Feminine odor must be treated diligently.  Very. Diligently.  Patty? Patty?	[]
Announcer	15	0	It looks like a woman is trying to take over for Jimmie Johnson's car.	[]
Geoff Hamill	1	0	What?	[]
Lowes Pit Boss	12	0	Ma'am? You are on an active racetrack. This is extremely dangerous.	[]
Geoff Hamill	50	0	Let me talk to her.  Patty? Patty, what are you doing?  Patty, pull over the NASCAR. You're acting irrationally. Patty, did you forget to take your medication? You know how you get when you don't use your Vagisil. There should be some in your purse, my Muse. Patty?	[]
Cartman	13	2	Aww! You dumb bitch! Butters, this bitch is tryin' to wreck my car.	['bitch', 'bitch']
Butters	10	2	I know. That pisses me off. That's fuckin' gay.	['fuckin', 'gay']
Cartman	4	3	Fuckin' gay as hell.	['fuckin', 'gay', 'hell']
Geoff Hamill	8	0	Patty, you are my Muse, and my flame.	[]
Announcer	9	0	They are neck and neck approaching the finish line.	[]
Cartman	5	2	Oh, fuck my ass again!	['fuck', 'ass']
Geoff Hamill	1	0	HAAAAAAAAAA!	[]
Announcer	9	0	Big celebration for the Lowe's Home Improvement team.	[]
Geoff Hamill	12	0	Patty! How could you?! You've ruined us! You've ruined Vagisil!	[]
Kenny	4	1	(HA! You fucking lose!)	['fucking']
Cartman	79	0	No, no, Kenny, go ahead. I deserve it. I thought I could just waltz onto a racetrack and do what these people do. But I owe you an apology. The truth is I'm just too smart. And with how smart I am I'll always be successful and therefore have money. I just have to accept I'm too smart and rich for NASCAR. Time for me to give it up. Alright Butters, give me back my money.	[]
Butters	1	0	Huh?	[]
Cartman	15	0	The fifty eight dollars and thirty two cents I gave you! I want it back!	[]
Butters	29	0	Uh, but- but you- you said I had to  s-spend on it on the... buy what I can start buyin' and start way in- bu- so get buy-	[]
Cartman	16	1	Goddammit Butters, you'd better have it! Butters, you're always trying to screw me over!	['goddammit']
Butters	17	0	But you said to take your money so I took it by  Ah I don't know.	[]
