Doctor	14	0	Hello, Mr. Garrison, I'm Dr. Biber. I'll be performing your surgery today.	[]
Mr. Garrison	12	0	God bless you, Doctor. I know you'll make me well again.	[]
Dr. Biber	9	0	Now, you're absolutely sure you want a vaginoplasty?	[]
Mr. Garrison	24	1	My whole life I've been a woman trapped in a man's body. A sex-change operation is my last chance at happiness.	['sex']
Dr. Biber	42	2	All right, then let's begin.  Just relax, Mr. Garrison. I think if more people could just see a sex-change operation, they would know how perfectly natural it is. The first thing I'm going to do is slice your balls.	['sex', 'balls']
Mr. Garrison	3	0	Ough, ergh. Eww.	[]
Dr. Biber	11	1	With the scrotum open, I can now discard of your testicles.	['scrotum']
Mr. Garrison	3	1	So long, balls.	['balls']
Dr. Biber	13	1	Now, I'll just continue the incision up the shaft of the penis.	['penis']
Mr. Garrison	3	0	Oh, that stings.	[]
Dr. Biber	9	1	Now I'll just... turn your... penis inside out.	['penis']
Mr. Garrison	3	0	OH! Oh jeez.	[]
Dr. Biber	28	3	All we need to do now is ...stuff the ...unskinned penis inside your... pelvis... And now I'll use the skin from your penis to make vaginal lips.	['penis', 'penis', 'vaginal']
Mr. Garrison	6	0	Do I look like a woman?	[]
Dr. Biber	2	0	Pretty much.	[]
Stan	5	0	Dude, don't be nervous.	[]
Kyle	19	0	How can I not be nervous? Trying out for the All-State team has been my dream for years.	[]
Stan	16	0	You're the best player at our school, dude. You'll make the team for sure.	[]
Cartman	8	1	This is ridiculous. Jews can't play basketball.	['jews']
Kyle	7	2	I beat out YOUR fat ass, Cartman!	['fat', 'ass']
Lead Referee	12	0	All students trying out for the All-State team to center court!	[]
Stan	2	0	Good luck.	[]
Coach	51	0	All right boys, now you're all here because you're the best of the best.  I know that you've all worked really hard to make it this far, so let's get out there and  SHOW ME WHAT YOU'VE GOT!  Uh, uh excuse me, Brof-Broflovski, is it?	[]
Kyle	1	0	Yeah?	[]
Coach	20	0	Can we talk to you for a minute?  You uh... You're the best player in your school, are ya?	[]
Kyle	13	0	Yep! I love basketball. I wanna play for the Denver Nuggets one day.	[]
Coach	23	0	Yeah. Uh, look, kid, you've got great skills and a great attitude. But you're just not physically ...built for the game.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Oo whataya mean?	[]
Coach	22	1	Well, it's just that... Jew's can't play basketball.  Awright, kids, we've gotta work on that shooting! Come on!	['jew']
Stan	20	0	Dude, you were awesome, Kyle.  Look, y-you gave it your best shot, right? That's all you could do.	[]
Cartman	20	0	Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa! You-hoo-hoo-hoo loh-ost! Hahahahahaaahaaa!  Kyle, I'm totally ripping on you at a totally inappropriate time.	[]
Kyle	5	0	I know. I deserve it.	[]
Cartman	10	1	Yeah, you know why? Because Jews can't play basketball!	['jews']
Kyle	7	0	You're right.  Jesus, that was fun...	[]
Man	8	0	Hey everybody, you're not gonna believe it!	[]
Randy	2	0	Believe what?	[]
Man	16	0	It's Mr. Garrison! Only it ISN'T Mr. Garrison! He- He's a woman now!	[]
Mrs. Garrison	35	1	Hello everybody!  Can you believe it ladies? I'm one of YOU now!  Wow, just look at all these tampons! Regular, heavy flow- Oh boy, I can't wait till I get my first period!	['tampons']
Mrs. Garrison	75	2	Hi gals!  Oh boy, can you believe the sales they're havin' out there? Well, I'm about to pee out my vagina for the first time.  Give us a hug. Girls' Club!  Oh wow! This is great! Look at that, I'm peeing sittin' down like a dainty dignified little woman!  Sany, any of you ladies wanna go see a sad movie together?  You guys try those new wings tampons? Do those work well?	['vagina', 'tampons']
Stan	15	0	Kyle, you have to cheer up, dude. So you aren't built right for basketball.	[]
Kyle	13	0	But I feel like a basketball player. That's all I wanna do.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	9	0	Hello, boys! It's me, your teacher! Mrs. Garrison!	[]
Cartman	6	1	You guys, Mr. Garrison has titties.	['titties']
Mrs. Garrison	28	3	I had a sex-chamge operation. My penis is now a vagina and I'm experiencing womanhood for the first time in my life! See ya in class!	['sex', 'penis', 'vagina']
Kyle	8	1	Mom? Dad? What's a sex-change operation?	['sex']
Gerald	18	0	What? Th'um, nuh-nothing. I- I'll explain it to you when you're a little older.	[]
Kyle	16	2	But our teacher, Mr. Garrison? He just had his penis made into a vagina. How come?	['penis', 'vagina']
Ike	1	1	Penis!	['penis']
Gerald	9	1	Your teacher had a sex change?? Oh my God!	['sex']
Ike	1	1	Vagina!	['vagina']
Gerald	12	0	That does it! I'm taking you boys OUT OF THAT SCHOOL!	[]
Sheila	17	0	Gerald, that is very closed-minded of you! You shouldn't judge people who want to change.	[]
Gerald	14	0	He's a teacher! How are we supposed to explain this to our children?!	[]
Sheila	20	0	It's very simple.  You see, Kyle, sometimes a person' outside doesn't reflect who they are on the inside.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Yeah. That's right.	[]
Sheila	33	0	They feel like they're somebody trapped in another person's body. And so, they can have a surgery  that makes them more into the person they see themselves as. Do you understand?	[]
Kyle	4	0	Totally! I totally understand!	[]
Sheila	7	0	There. You see, Gerald? He totally understands.	[]
Dr. Biber	9	0	So, I hear you're interested in reconstructive surgery.	[]
Kyle	15	0	Yeah. My school teacher wanted to be a woman, and you made him into one.	[]
Dr. Biber	11	0	Oh yes, Mr. Garrison. Uh yes, he had a vaginoplasty. Mhm.	[]
Kyle	9	0	Well, do you also do other surgeries like that?	[]
Dr. Biber	17	0	Sure. You see sometimes a woman wants to be a man. That procedure is called a peniplasty.	[]
Kyle	9	0	No, no, uh I wanna be tall and black.	[]
Dr. Biber	2	0	...You what?	[]
Kyle	13	1	I hate being small and Jewish. I feel like a tall black man.	['jewish']
Dr. Biber	5	0	Ohhhhh! You want a negroplasty!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Stan	4	0	Wha-a-a negroplasty??	[]
Dr. Biber	102	0	It's a fairly common procedure, really, just the reverse of a caucasioplasty just like Michael Jackson had. Let's take a look here.  What we do is slice your face and peel it back so we can insert now pigment producing cells inside.  We break the arm bones in several places and put braces to make them longer.  Now, the knees we need to snap off and fill with small round objects that can cause better movement.  And we finish it off with a nice peniplasty to enhance the genitalia.  Negroplasty takes about seven hours and costs roughly three thousand dollars.	[]
Stan	9	0	Uh excuse me, is this really a good idea?	[]
Dr. Biber	19	0	Well, it's a good idea if you wanna be tall and black. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	61	1	Hello, Mr. Slave.  Boy have I been busy. A woman's work is never done.  I got some tampons. I should be getting my period really soon. I hope I don't get too emotional and drive you crazy with my PMS.  Mr. Slave, I got !Mrs.somethin' for us, too.  Would you like to take this beautiful woman to bed?	['tampons']
Mr. Slave	2	0	No thanks.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	14	0	Nu- no thanks? Come on, Mr. Slave, I wanna try out my new snootch.	[]
Mr. Slave	19	0	I can't believe you just went ahead and had that surgery without even asking me what I thought.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	19	2	Well, I ASSUMED you supported me. It's still me; I just have a vagina instead of a penis.	['vagina', 'penis']
Mr. Slave	9	2	But I'm gay! I don't like vaginas!	['gay', 'vaginas']
Mrs. Garrison	17	0	Don't you even care that I was suffering? I wasn't happy the way I was!	[]
Mr. Slave	21	0	It's great that you feel better, but you never stopped to think about how other people around you would feel!	[]
Mrs. Garrison	15	1	Look, we can still be together. All you have to do is stop being gay!	['gay']
Mr. Slave	9	1	How can you say that?! You're gay too!	['gay']
Mrs. Garrison	8	1	I'm not gay! I'm a woman!	['gay']
Mr. Slave	3	0	Oh, Jesus Christ!	[]
Mrs. Garrison	29	2	Oh, so is that it?!  You're just gonna walk out?! You men are all alike! Go ahead and find somebody who doesn't have a vagina, you fag!	['vagina', 'fag']
Kyle	23	1	Mom! Dad! I have awesome news! The doctor who gave Mr. Garrison his sex change said he can make me tall and black.	['sex']
Sheila	1	0	What??	[]
Kyle	40	0	Dr. Biber said he can give me a negroplasty so I can finally look the way I've always wanted. He even took my picture and then did computer imaging to show what I would look like after the surgery.	[]
Gerald	22	0	Oh, just great! You see, Sheila?! This is what your transgender progressive thinking gets you! Now your son wants to be transracial!	[]
Kyle	12	0	Can I have three thousand dollars, Mom and Dad, huh?? Can I??	[]
Sheila	3	0	Absolutely not, Kyle!	[]
Kyle	16	0	But why not? You said sometimes people need surgery to make them feel better about themselves.	[]
Sheila	3	0	Yes, but Kyle-	[]
Kyle	32	0	Well, all my life I felt I was black! I've listened to hip-hop, I watch UPN and I love playing basketball! My body doesn't reflect who I am inside.	[]
Sheila	11	0	Kyle, you have to accept your body the way it is.	[]
Kyle	13	0	Why? Why do I have to accept it when I can change it?	[]
Sheila	12	0	The answer is NO, Kyle! You're NOT going to have negroplasty!	[]
Kyle	6	1	But Jews can't play basketball!	['jews']
Gerald	11	0	Kyle, you'd better stop being anti-Semitic right now, mister!!	[]
Kyle	10	0	I'm never speaking to either of you ever again!	[]
Gerald	4	0	Oh, that does it!	[]
Sheila	4	0	Where are you going?!	[]
Gerald	11	1	That Dr. Biber is about to get his ass bitten off!	['ass']
Gerald	8	1	Who the hell do you think you are?!	['hell']
Dr. Biber	2	0	Dr. Biber.	[]
Gerald	16	0	What kind of nutjob would agree to surgically alter my son into a tall African-American?!	[]
Dr. Biber	6	0	Oh, you're Kyle's father.	[]
Gerald	26	0	Huh that's right! And I also happen to be a lawyer! And I'm gonna have you sued for malpractice, and your clinic shut down!!	[]
Dr. Biber	6	0	What is that on your shirt?	[]
Gerald	9	0	What th- Look, they're- They're dolphins! Why?	[]
Dr. Biber	5	0	Ahhh you like dolphins, hm?	[]
Gerald	31	0	A b--uh I love dolphins, Ever since I was a child I dreamt of... Huh b-b-b- But that has hardly any bearing on what I'm hear to-	[]
Dr. Biber	5	0	I can make you one.	[]
Gerald	1	0	...What?	[]
Dr. Biber	21	0	Invert the back, move the esophagus to the top of the head. Yes, a full dolphinoplasty could be achieved relatively simply...	[]
Gerald	4	0	Make me a... dolphin?	[]
Singer	20	0	If I could swim with the dolphins, the soft and gentle dolphins...Why can't I swim with the dolphins?	[]
Gerald	6	0	...No.  No, no, it's crazy.	[]
Dr. Biber	20	0	There's nothing crazy about a person wanting to look on the outside the way they feel on ths inside.	[]
Announcer	10	0	It's Girls Gone Wild!  These girls will do anything!	[]
Mrs. Garrison	17	1	Oh jeez, should I do it?! Should I do it?! Oh what the hell!  Wooo! Huhuh, wooo!	['hell']
Men	1	0	Awww!	[]
Mrs. Garrison	13	0	Look, I'll giggle and make them bounce up and down!  Heeheeheeheehee, heeheeheeheeheeheehee.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	77	3	Oh boy, men will do just about anything to get a look at our tits, won't they? Men are all the same. My boyfriend walked out on me! Turns out he was a fag. But I've been livin' it up ever since, havin' sex with all kinds of different guys! Girl power!  You know, the strange thing is, I haven't gotten my period yet. Is there a reason a woman might miss her period?	['tits', 'fag', 'sex']
Redhead	13	0	Well, normally, if a woman misses her period, it means she's pregnant.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	38	0	...Pregnant?  Oh my God. Of course.  I haven't gotten to experience a period because... one of those truckers I slept with got me knocked up.  I'm pregnant, everybody! Hoh boy, now I can have an abortion!	[]
Sheila	5	0	Gerald! What happened to you?!	[]
Gerald	23	0	That doctor is a miracle worker, Sheila. Iiii'm the happiest I've ever been.  Look, Ike! You're daddy's a dolphin!	[]
Sheila	2	0	A dolphin?!?!	[]
Gerald	38	0	Sheila, ih-it was wrong of us to be so judgmental of Kyle. If he isn't happy with who he is, then who are we to deny hm surgery that will make him feel better about himself?	[]
Sheila	4	0	Gerald, this is crazy!	[]
Gerald	72	0	I used to think I was crazy. But Dr, Biber told me that there are a lot of other people out there who are transspecies. All I did is change my appearance to look the way I felt...  here. And I'm telling you now that if we don't let Kyle do the same, he may never be happy. Ever! We owe him more than that, Sheila. We owe him understanding!	[]
Butters	7	0	Fellas! Hey fellas, you gotta come see!	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Butters	9	0	Uhh, it's Kyle! Huh, he's a Negro!	[]
Jason	1	0	Wow.	[]
Craig	4	0	Can't believe it.	[]
Clyde	3	0	Did it hurt?	[]
Kyle	7	0	Yeah, but it was totally worth it.	[]
Stan	3	0	Jesus Christ, dude!	[]
Kyle	31	0	Look, Stan, I'm finally whole! My dad is even gonna take me back down to the all-star game to see if I can try out for the team again!	[]
Gerald	7	0	Come on, Kyle, we should get going!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Alright, Dad!	[]
Stan	7	0	Dude, is Kyle's- dad a- dolphin?	[]
Cartman	7	2	He's a Jewish dolphin. A Jewphin.	['jewish', 'jewphin']
Mrs. Garrison	32	0	You here for an abortion too?  Yeah, I discovered a few days ago I wasn't bleedin' out my coo, so I guess I'm knocked up. Is this doctor any good?	[]
Nurse	2	0	Mrs... Garrison?	[]
Mrs. Garrison	4	0	Oh, that's me.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	8	0	Hello doctor, looks like I need an abortion.	[]
Doctor	2	0	...an abortion?	[]
Mrs. Garrison	35	1	Yeah, I've got one growing inside me. Now, are you gonna scramble its brains or just vacuum it out?  ...If you want you can just scramble it and I'll queef it out myself.	['queef']
Doctor	2	0	Mmister Garrison-	[]
Mrs. Garrison	2	0	Mrs. Garrison.	[]
Doctor	8	0	Mmrs. Garrison, you can't have an abortion.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	22	0	Don't you tell me what I can and can't do with my body!  A woman has a right to choose!	[]
Doctor	17	0	No, I mean you're physically unable to have an abortion, because you can't get pregnant.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	5	0	But I missed my period.	[]
Doctor	27	1	You can't have periods either.  You had a sex change, Mr. Garrison, but you don't have ovaries or a womb. You don't produce eggs.	['sex']
Mrs. Garrison	26	0	You mean, I'll never know what it feels like to have a baby growing inside me and then scramble its brains and vacuum it out?	[]
Doctor	4	0	N-that's right.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	35	1	But I paid five thousand dollars to be a woman. This would mean I I'm not really a woman. Ih, I'm just a... a I'm just a guy with a mutilated penis!	['penis']
Doctor	2	0	Basically, yes.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	8	1	...Oh boy, do I feel like a jackass.	['jackass']
Mrs. Garrison	2	1	Hey asshole!	['asshole']
Dr. Biber	8	0	Excuse me, I'm performing an operation here!	[]
Mrs. Garrison	12	0	You told me you were going to make me into a woman!	[]
Dr. Biber	6	1	I gave you a sex change.	['sex']
Mrs. Garrison	36	1	Yeah?! Well what kind of woman can't have abortions and bleed out her snatch once a month?! You made me into a FREAK is what you did! And I want you to change me back!	['freak']
Patient	5	0	Am I a man yet?	[]
Dr. Biber	8	0	Mr. Garrison, I can't reattach your organs.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	4	1	Why the hell not?!	['hell']
Dr. Biber	22	0	Because I've already used your testicles to fashion new knees for a little boy who wanted to be tall and black.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	2	0	You WHAT?!	[]
Dr. Biber	21	1	And your scrotum has been made into a dorsal fin for a man who wanted to look more like a dolphin.	['scrotum']
Mrs. Garrison	19	1	Oh you! You're comin' with me right now to find my ball and scrotum right now, Mr. Man!	['scrotum']
Announcer	23	0	Welcome to the All-State Basketball Playoffs between the best fourth-grade players from Colorado and the best fourth-grade players from Wyoming.	[]

Mrs. Garrison	10	0	Boys, have you seen Kyle?! He's not at home.	[]
Stan	11	0	Kyle went down to play in the basketball game, Mrs. Garrison.	[]
Dr. Biber	9	0	He's going to play basketball? Oh my God.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	1	0	What?	[]
Dr. Biber	24	0	Well, ah I only made him look like he could play basketball. If he actually does it, the testicle in his knees will explode!	[]
Stan	9	0	What?! But you made him into a basketball player.	[]
Dr. Biber	25	1	No, I just made him look more like one. We have to stop him from playing! Those testicles in his knees are ticking time balls!	['balls']
Mrs. Garrison	13	1	Oh Jesus! We've gotta get to my balls before Kyle hurts himself!	['balls']
Singer	6	0	...and the home of the... brave!	[]
Coach	8	0	Broflovski, be ready to take over for Owens.	[]
Kyle	7	0	I'm a hundred percent ready, coach!	[]
Gerald	10	0	Eh excuse me, where, where is the bathroom for dolphins?	[]
Usher	5	0	We don't... have one.	[]
Gerald	21	1	Well where the hell am I supposed to go to the bathroom? I I need a large tank with salt water.	['hell']
Usher	3	0	Ahhh- Too bad?	[]
Gerald	24	1	Damnit you people have to make special arrangements for transspecies people like me! I may be a dolphin, but I'm also a lawyer!	['damnit']
Usher	4	0	You're a lawphin?	[]
Usher	2	0	Tickets please.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	5	0	We don't have tickets!	[]
Security Guard	7	0	Sorry ma'am, no tickets, no entry.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	17	1	Look, there's a boy with my balls in his knees and he's in serious danger!	['balls']
Usher	1	0	What?	[]
Mrs. Garrison	11	2	My scrotum!  That dolphin has my scrotum! Now let us in!	['scrotum', 'scrotum']
Security Guard	14	0	You can't go in, ma'am!  We have unauthorized entry on level one!	[]
Coach	9	0	All right. Broflovski, you're going in next possession.	[]
Kyle	4	0	All right!  Ow. Hm.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	4	0	Gerald, where's Kyle?!	[]
Gerald	2	0	What? Why??	[]
Mrs. Garrison	14	1	My balls are in his knees. If he jumps with them they'll explode!	['balls']
Gerald	3	0	Oh my God!	[]
Security Guard	7	0	There they are, next to that dolphin!	[]
Dr. Biber	9	1	Come on, we've gotta get to those balls!	['balls']
Security Guard	11	0	Stop them! They didn't pay the two-dollar entry fee!	[]
Announcer	8	0	Now substituting for Colorado, number 8, Kyle Broflovski.	[]
Stan	7	0	Oh Jesus, he's about to play!	[]
Gerald	4	0	Mrs. Garrison, grab Kyle!	[]
Mrs. Garrison	4	0	Which one is he??	[]
Wyoming Coach	4	1	Hey, what the hell?!	['hell']
Gerald	3	0	Stop the game!	[]
Kyle	7	0	I got it! I got the ball.	[]
Stan	2	0	Kyle, NO!	[]
Announcer	5	0	Broflovski goes for the dunk!	[]
Mrs. Garrison	3	0	NO!  My baaaallllssss.	[]
Officer	31	1	So let me get this straight. That woman over there was trying to get to her balls which were in the knees of a black child whose father is a dolphin.	['balls']
Stan	5	0	Yeah, that's basically it.	[]
Officer	14	0	Sounds like an open and shut case. All right, let's head 'em out!	[]
Dr. Biber	14	0	I'm sorry, Kyle, I should have told you the surgery was cosmetic only.	[]
Gerald	10	0	So, does this mean I'm not really a dolphin?	[]
Dr. Biber	19	0	Let's get you two up to the clinic and I'll change you back, for a nominal fee.	[]
Kyle	10	0	But what about Mr. Garrison? He can't go back.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	52	1	You know what? I'm okay. Even though I'm not truly a woman, I think I still like the new me. I'd rather be a woman who can't have periods than a fag.  Hey guys! This girl is staying a woman! Who wants to pound my vadge! Girl power!	['fag']
