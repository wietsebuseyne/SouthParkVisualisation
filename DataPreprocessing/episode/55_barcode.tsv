Mr. Wyland	15	0	Good morning, children. Mr. Garrison is away today. I am your substitute teacher, Mr. Wyland.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Oh, sweet, dude. Substitute teacher.	[]
Mr. Wyland	48	0	Now, I understand that some students in this class like to mess with substitute teachers.  But if we all behave and respect each other, I'm sure we can make this a fun and productive day. Let's start with roll call. Let's see, mmmmm.  Eric Cartman?	[]
Stan	1	0	Here!	[]
Mr. Wyland	6	0	Alright, and how about Stan Marsh?	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Here.)	[]
Wendy	8	0	It's not that funny, you guys. Jesus.	[]
Mr. Wyland	6	0	Okay, and where iiiiss... Kenny McCormick?	[]
Cartman	4	0	Here.  Oh, hoho. Ow.	[]
Stan	6	1	Dude, what the hell was that?	['hell']
Cartman	23	2	Oh, huh. Oh, geez, you know, when you're laughin' so hard that the milk comes out your nose? Uh ho ho, man!	['ho', 'ho']
Stan	7	0	...Dude, you weren't drinking any milk.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Huh?	[]
Stan	10	0	You have to be drinking milk for that to happen.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Not with me, man.	[]
Mr. Wyland	34	0	Alright. Look, why don't we skip roll call? Here's what we're gonna do today.  I've been told that one of your classmates has been ill for several days - Kyle Broflovski?	[]
Stan	3	0	He's fakin'!	[]
Mr. Wyland	49	0	Well, I've been told that in Mr. Garrison's absence, our activity for the day is to make a get-well card for Kyle. So I got this large piece of poster board, and we're all gonna come up and use glitter.and glue to decorate it.	[]
The Class	1	0	Awww.	[]
Cartman	3	0	He's fakin'!	[]
Mr. Wyland	10	0	Kenny, you come and decorate the get-well card, too.	[]
Cartman	12	0	But I don't want Kyle to get well. I hate Kyle.	[]
Mr. Wyland	10	0	I don't care! Get down here and do it!	[]
Butters	8	0	Hey, watch it!  Hey, what are you doin'?	[]
Stan	7	0	Now, that's a get-well card!	[]
Chairman	19	0	Mr. Garrison, after very careful review the school board believes that you should take a... hiatus from teaching. Indefinitely.	[]
Mr. Garrison	1	0	What??	[]
Board Member	7	0	Frankly, your conduct has been somewhat disconcerting.	[]
Chairman	14	0	Did you know that not one of your students knew who Sam Adams was?	[]
Mr. Garrison	17	0	Well, who cares about a guy that makes beer?! Jesus Christ, I'm trying to teach history!	[]
Chairman	23	0	...Frankly, Mr. Garrison, it isn't even your educational record that we're most concerned about.  It's your somewhat substantial police record.	[]
Mr. Garrison	2	0	Oh, whatever!	[]
Principal Victoria	15	1	Mr. Garrison, last week's charges of attempting to solicit sex from a minor wa-	['sex']
Mr. Garrison	8	0	That was not me, that was Mr. Hat!	[]
Board Member	24	1	All we're saying is, perhaps you should take a little hiatus from teaching until this little  child molestation thing dies down a bit.	['molestation']
Mr. Garrison	13	0	Gentlemen, teaching is all I know. It is the air that I breathe.	[]
Chairman	9	0	We're sorry, Mr. Garrison, we have no choice.	[]
Mr. Garrison	20	0	Very well. I guess... I'm not a teacher anymore.  I suppose you'll be wanting my badge and gun...	[]
Chairman	9	0	Mr. Garrison, most teachers do not carry a gun!	[]
Mr. Garrison	8	0	Oh, sorry. So I can keep it then?	[]
Sheila	10	0	Kyle, Stan and his mother came over to visit you.	[]
Sharon	2	0	Hello, sweetie.	[]
Stan	12	0	Dude, you can stop faking now. We got a substitute teacher.  Kyle?	[]
Sheila	21	0	They say it's his kidneys. Kyle always has been a diabetic and lately his kidneys have just been shutting down.	[]
Sharon	11	0	Well, the kids at school made you a card, Kyle. Look.	[]
Stan	3	0	Go on, Butters!	[]
Butters	5	1	Ho, I don't wanna!	['ho']
Stan	3	0	Butters, go on!	[]
Butters	58	0	Oh, uhuh alright, then.  We're so sorry you're not feeling well. We hope you're better soon. So we're bringing you some sunshine By, um, singing you this tune: Everybody misses you And though we hate to cause a fuss We'd like to say, Get well soon! And Please don't die on us.	[]
Stan	6	0	Dude, you really are sick, huh?	[]
Kyle	5	0	I don't know, I...	[]
Sheila	20	0	I don't know what to do, Sharon. They wanna have him go into surgery, but they're so dangerous.	[]
Sharon	16	0	Sheila, have you tried holistic natural medicines? They work wonders. I read all about in People.	[]
Sheila	3	0	Really? In People?	[]
Sharon	26	0	There's a brand-new shop in town that sells holistic medicines and all-natural foods. It's run by this fascinating woman named Miss Information.	[]
Sheila	12	0	Oh, well, with a name like Miss Information she must know something.	[]
Sharon	17	0	Why don't we at least take Kyle down there and see what she has to say.	[]
Sheila	6	0	Okay. I'll get our coats.	[]
Butters	4	0	Can I go now?	[]
Mr. Garrison	16	0	I don't know what I'm goin' tuh do, Mackey. Teaching is all I know.	[]
Mr. Mackey	20	0	Okay, well, maybe you need to view this as a chance to do something you've always wanted to do.	[]
Mr. Garrison	8	0	I've always wanted to write a novel.	[]
Mr. Mackey	6	0	Well, there you go, m'kay?	[]
Mr. Garrison	8	0	But I never know what to write about.	[]
Mr. Mackey	19	0	Well that's easy. Write about what you know. Write about what you love. What do you love most?	[]
Mr. Garrison	2	0	Besides teaching?	[]
Mr. Mackey	1	0	Yes.	[]
Mr. Garrison	1	0	...Poontang.	[]
Mr. Mackey	3	0	M, m'kay	[]
Mr. Garrison	34	0	I can't help it. I'm a womanizer sometimes, I know, but I just think that... taking a woman home and getting some hot poon is about the greatest thing in the world.	[]
Mr. Mackey	18	0	Well that settles it, Mr. Garrison. What you need to do is go write a great romance novel.	[]
Mr. Garrison	14	0	Yes, that's it.  I am going to write the Great American Romance Novel!	[]
Miss Information	12	0	You see, the reason our body is stale is because of toxins.	[]
Sheila	1	0	Toxins?	[]
Miss Information	58	0	All the horrible food we eat-the sodas and meats are filled with toxins, and the only way for us to get better is to flush those toxins out of our system. Western medicine is so quick to cut and carve up, but all your son needs is a toxin-flushing diet of lemon juice and cayenne pepper.	[]
Sharon	6	0	Wow, that's amazing, Miss Information!	[]
Sheila	11	0	You hear that, Kyle? You don't need surgery after all.	[]
Stan	10	0	Uh excuse me, but, what do these toxins look like?	[]
Miss Information	1	0	What?	[]
Stan	8	0	Wuh, have you ever actually seen a toxin?	[]
Sharon	6	1	Don't be a smartass, Stanley.	['smartass']
Miss Information	24	0	Mrs. Broflovski, I would like to give your son herbs that focus on the kidney. I have these excellent herbs from local Native Americans.	[]
Sharon	12	0	Ooo, Native Americans. Now, they know how to heal the body spiritually.	[]
Mr. Garrison	134	6	Out on the balcony, when Reginald kissed Diana's lips, her knees went weak. Slowly, he pulled her top down, exposing her soft, unyielding breasts Oh yeah, now this is getting good  Just the sight of those breasts made Reginald's penis very hard. His penis was of considerable size, and now beads of sweat slowly ran down his penis, making it glisten like a strong swimmer fresh from out of the pool. It was a fantastic penis, that seemed as strong as a horse's leg, yet as delicate as a flower wrapped in silk. What a grand, grand penis. Diana's nipples Uh, let's see...  Diana's nipples...  Oh, writer's block, writer's block! Hmmm. Crap! I'm stuck.  Oh well, maybe that's enough writing for today, Mr. Hat.	['penis', 'penis', 'penis', 'penis', 'penis', 'crap']
Mrs. Tweak	5	0	Oh my, he looks terrible.	[]
Blonde Mother	4	0	Yes, poor little dear.	[]
Miss Information	3	0	Good morning, everyone.	[]
Blonde Mother	12	0	Oh, thanks for coming, Miss. Information. Kyle seems to be getting worse.	[]
Miss Information	10	0	Huuuuuuuuuh  Oh, I don't agree. He seems much better.	[]
Sheila	1	0	Really?	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Miss Information	14	0	Yes, his chi is flowing much nicer than yesterday, and his aura is lighter.	[]
Sharon	5	0	Oh, that's great news!	[]
Sheila	2	0	Oh no!	[]
Miss Information	13	0	Nono, that's good. Those are the toxins flushing out of the system.	[]
Sharon	1	0	Ooooo.	[]
Stan	17	0	Those aren't toxins. That's the bean with bacon soup he ate half an hour ago.	[]
Sharon	9	1	Stanley, what did I say about being a smartass?!	['smartass']
Stan	5	1	Don't be a smartass?	['smartass']
Miss Information	31	0	Now, don't be fooled. As Kyle's body sheds itself more and more of all the toxins he will appear to be getting worse, but actually, he is getting better!	[]
Sheila	13	0	Wow. Well, I am on natural medicines. If only I had known sooner.	[]
Other mothers	6	0	I agree. Yeah. That's right.	[]
Nurse	7	0	Mr. Marsh is here to see you.	[]
Dr. Doctor	6	0	Alright, send him in.  Oh, Stanley.	[]
Stan	2	0	Hi, doctor.	[]
Dr. Doctor	5	0	How can I help you?	[]
Stan	13	0	Well, it's my friend, Kyle. I think he's really, really sick.	[]
Dr. Doctor	31	0	He is really, really sick, Stanley. I was seeing him last week when he first got ill, but unfortunately his mother has decided to put all her trust into holistic medicine.	[]
Stan	8	0	But I don't think it's working.	[]
Dr. Doctor	28	0	Alright, Stanley, I'm going to be very honest with you. Your little friend Kyle needs a kidney transplant. Or it is very possible that... he will die.	[]
Stan	11	0	Die? But... Kyle's my best friend. In the whole world.	[]
Dr. Doctor	33	1	I know this is a lot to lay on someone your age, but... the rest of the town is so gung-ho in New Age medicine that I have nowhere else to turn.	['ho']
Stan	17	0	...I'll give Kyle my kidney, even if it hurts a whole lot; I don't care.	[]
Dr. Doctor	39	0	That's very brave, Stan, but I've already checked my records, and you and Kyle aren't a match for kidneys. In fact,  there's only one person in South Park with the same blood type as Kyle.	[]
Stan	3	1	Who?  Oh, shit.	['shit']
Kenny	5	0	(Rrrrooowwwrrr, rroowwrr, pew, pew, POW.)	[]
Cartman	13	0	Coming in for attack, Captain. Pipew, pipipew  Give me the space cruiser, Kenny.	[]
Kenny	2	0	(No, no.)	[]
Cartman	20	0	Come on, Kenny, you have to give me the subspace cruiser  so I can destroy the Gengrins on Crespus 5.	[]
Kenny	11	0	(Unngh. Stop, no! No, it's mine!)  (There! It's mine!)	[]
Cartman	22	0	No, mine. M'yah!  Ha haa ha! I broke your space cruiser, Kenny! Ha haa, ha ha ha  bluh oh, ha-ow!	[]
Liane	8	0	Ooh, sweetums, did you laugh too hard again?	[]
Cartman	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Liane	13	0	Well, some more of your little friends are here to play with you.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Okay, mom.	[]
Liane	16	0	And don't get too close to Kyle. He looks like he might have the AIDS.	[]
Cartman	5	0	What's goin' on, guys?	[]
Stan	12	0	Cartman, we have to ask you a question. A very serious question.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Oh-kay.	[]
Stan	26	0	Kyle's in trouble, Cartman. I can see him getting worse right before my eyes. There might be a way that you... can save his life.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Uh huh.	[]
Stan	8	0	What Kyle really needs... is a new kidney.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Oh, I think I see where this is going.	[]
Stan	19	1	His mom is trying all this Eastern medicine and New Age bullcrap on him, but its obviously not working.	['bullcrap']
Cartman	9	0	Stan, why don't you just ask the question?	[]
Stan	10	0	Alright. Will you donate one of your kidneys to Kyle?	[]
Cartman	10	0	No no, no no, no! No no, no no, no!	[]
Stan	7	1	But you only need one, fat boy!	['fat']
Cartman	9	0	No no, no no, nono no!Nonono, no no!	[]
Stan	17	0	Dude, one of your friends is goin' tuh die! Don't you see how serious this is?!	[]
Kenny	7	1	(It's not that's fucking serious.)	['fucking']
Cartman	15	0	Well, perhaps I could see my way to giving up a kidney. For a price.	[]
Stan	3	0	Oh my God!	[]
Kyle	2	0	How much?	[]
Cartman	13	0	I don't know. How much is your life worth to you, Kyle?	[]
Stan	10	1	Cartman, you are so going to hell when you die!	['hell']
Cartman	10	0	Yes, well, until then, I need about ten million dollars.	[]
Kenny	3	0	(Ten million dollars??)	[]
Stan	11	1	What the hell would you do with ten million dollars, fatass?!	['hell']
Cartman	35	0	What I intend to do with the money is not an issue, is it? I suggest you start looking for that money quickly. Kyle doesn't seem to have much time. Tick-tock. Tick-tock.	[]
Stan	9	0	Come on, Kyle. Let's get out of here.	[]
Cartman	27	0	Okay. Where were we, Kenny? Oh yeah.  Quick, Captain, we must destroy the Gengrin across the fire. Give me the space cruiser. Give it, Kenny. M'yah!	[]
Man 1	4	0	Ooo, free-range aspirin!	[]
Man 2	4	0	All-natural cell phones!	[]
Miss Information	16	0	Oh, look everyone. These are our two resident Native Americans. Chief Running Pinto, and Carlos Ramirez.	[]
Man 3	1	0	Ooo.	[]
Man 4	8	0	I'd like to buy some more stuff.	[]
Man 5	5	0	Come in. Come here, guys.	[]
Man 6	9	0	Do you have any new holistic items for sale?	[]
Carlos Ramirez	12	0	Oohh, oh yeah. Aah...  Here, uh, this is a- uhh, dream...catcher.	[]
Woman 1	7	0	Oh, a dreamcatcher. I'll buy one.	[]
Chief Running Pinto	21	2	Yeah. And these here are Cherokee hair tampons. They're, like, tampons made with all-natural hair from the Cherokee people.	['tampons', 'tampons']
Sharon	11	1	Ooh, a tampon made from Cherokee hair-now that sounds natural.	['tampon']
Miss Information	12	0	Native Americans are more in tune with the earth than we are.	[]
Chief Running Pinto	7	0	Oh yeah. We love the earth, man.	[]
Carlos Ramirez	6	0	Oh yeah, the earth is great.	[]
Miss Information	23	0	Mrs. Broflovski's son is a little sick. Perhaps she could bring him in tomorrow and you could give him some spiritual healing.	[]
Chief Running Pinto	18	0	Oh, sure. We could do that, man. We'll give him, like, a, a brain enema, or somethin'.	[]
Carlos Ramirez	5	2	uh'hm, ho ho hm.	['ho', 'ho']
Sheila	1	0	Wonderful!	[]
Miss Information	17	0	Why don't you follow me over to the cash register and I'll take a deposit.	[]
Man 7	12	0	D'you have anymore stuff to sell? We wanna buy more stuff.	[]
Man 8	5	0	Yes. Much, much more stuff.	[]
Chief Running Pinto	23	0	Sure, uh, we just gotta go back to our truck- I'm, I mean our horses and grab some more junk.  Come on.	[]
Miss Information	11	0	Good-bye, Native Americans. The spirit of Maya is with you.	[]
Carlos Ramirez	6	0	Oh yah. You too and junk.	[]
Chief Running Pinto	4	0	That's funny, man.	[]
Sharon	13	0	Oh hi, Stanley. Look, I'm buying you some more all-natural toothpaste.	[]
Stan	13	1	You mean the stuff that tastes like ass and doesn't fight cavities?	['ass']
Sharon	3	0	That's right.	[]
Stan	29	0	Look, um... I know that you all think the earth and its natural healing powers can cure Kyle, but... the doctor at the hospital told me it can't.	[]
Miss Information	25	0	Well, of course the doctor told you that, because he wants to make money. Holistic medicine is about NATURE.  Two-hundred and thirty-three dollars.	[]
Sheila	19	0	Everything's going to be fine, Stan. We're bringing Kyle in tomorrow to see the Native Americans personally.	[]
Stan	15	0	Isn't it possible that these Indians don't know what they're talking about?	[]
Sharon	20	1	You watch your mouth, Stanley! The Native Americans were raped of their land and resources by white people like us!	['raped']
Stan	10	0	And that has something to do with their medicines because...?	[]
Sharon	2	0	Enough, Stanley!	[]
Stan	5	0	Nobody wants to listen, Kenny.	[]
Kenny	2	0	(I know.)	[]
Stan	23	0	I don't know what else to do. I mean, he could die, Kenny. And that means we'd never see him again.	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Uh huh.)	[]
Stan	72	0	I guess maybe I've always taken friends for granted, like they'd always be there. If a friend died, I don't know what I'd do.  Well, I'm not just gonna stand here and watch my friend die. Kenny, go round up all the kids in town who want to help Kyle! Round them up and meet me at the bus stop at 7:30! Kyle's gonna live!	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Rrrh!)	[]
Mr. Garrison	140	5	Chapter 18. Diana had never slept with another woman before, but it was an erotic thought she often fantasized about. Oh yeah, Mr. Hat. Hot lesbo scene comin' up! And as Rebecca's naked body lay before her, Diana couldn't help but feel aroused.  Go on, Rebecca said softly, Touch me. Diana leaned down slowly and brushed Rebecca's bare stomach with her fingertips... It felt good. Like a penis. A soft, but sturdy penis that felt warn to the touch. In Rebecca's mind, she suddenly felt like she was surrounded by penises. They were all around her, flopping all around and slapping her face. It was as if she were in a redwood forest of penises. They presented themselves tall and mighty all around her, with... Mr. Hat, what the hell are you doing?!  Oh, Mr. Hat!	['penis', 'penis', 'penises', 'penises', 'hell']
Stan	5	0	Come on, where are they?	[]
Stan	3	0	This is it??	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Uh huh)	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmiiihh!	[]
Stan	8	0	This is everyone that wanted to help Kyle??	[]
Butters	24	0	Well, Clyde was gonna come too, but he, he said his mom was makin' tacos for dinner and Clyde likes tacos a whole lot.	[]
Stan	13	0	Jesus Christ! Alright, Butters, you take this medical book, and everyone follow me!	[]
Butters	5	0	Huh, where are we goin'?	[]
Stan	8	0	We're gon' tuh take Cartman's kidney.	[]
Daughter	9	0	Mom... Do you ever have those heavy flow days?	[]
Mother	5	0	Oh absolutely sweetheart, everybody does.	[]
Daughter	13	0	Mom, remember the movie The Shining where the elevator doors are opening up..	[]
Mother	10	1	Oh honey what you need is a more absorbent tampon.	['tampon']
Daughter	2	0	Like what?	[]
Mother	10	0	Well, what's the most absorbent thing in the world?	[]
Daughter	14	0	Well... Cherokee hair I guess.   But what does that have to do with me?	[]
Mother	10	1	Because now there is all new, natural  Cherokee hair tampons.  .	['tampons']
Female announcer	49	3	A cotton tampon can hold only so much liquid.  Other tampons also come up short.  But Cherokee hair has been known for ages to be strong and powerful  Each tampon is hand woven  from over 200 strands of Cherokee hair and then bound together with these decorative native beads.	['tampon', 'tampons', 'tampon']
Daughter	13	1	You were right mom! All natural Cherokee hair tampons really did the trick.	['tampons']
Mother	18	0	And when you're done using them  they make a great toy for Jessie.  Go get it boy!	[]
Jessie	2	0	Grrr... grrrr	[]
Chief Running Pinto (Tommy Chong in his stoner voice)	17	1	Let the wonders and the mysteries of our people, like, change the way you think about tampons.	['tampons']
Cartman	10	0	No! NO! Hip- hippies all around me. Help! Mommy! Huhuhippies!	[]
Stan	33	0	Okay, it's clear.  Okay. Me and Butters are gonna go up and take Cartman's kidney out of him. Kenny, you stay here and guard his mom's door here with Timmy.	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmiihh!	[]
Stan	1	0	Sshhh!	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmiihh.	[]
Stan	14	0	If she hears him screaming, or comes out or anything, just... stall her. Alright?	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Okay)	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmiihh.	[]
Stan	28	0	Alright Butters, let's go.  Uh-oh, Cartman's pig.  Sshh, good pig. Good pig. Goood pig. Sshh. Okay.  Come on, we gotta get outta here!  Oh, no!	[]
Butters	5	0	Oh well, we're busted.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Shut up, Fluffy!	[]
Stan	2	0	Oh, phew.	[]
Cartman	24	0	Hippies. Hi-i-ippies. They're everywhere. They wanna save the earth, but all they do is smoke pot and smell bad. He-elp!	[]
Stan	16	0	Okay, here we go.  Okay, let's see. Looks like if we cut here, and here...	[]
Butters	13	0	I hope it's not too bloody; I'm wearin' my favorite pants.	[]
Stan	18	0	...vein right, well-  Well, here goes nothing. Help me pull his pajamas up.  No way! Kidney Blocker 2000?!	[]
Cartman	14	0	whatwhatwhatwhat?  Oh, it's Stan and Butters! Trying to take my kidney, are you?!	[]
Stan	3	0	You suck, Cartman!	[]
Cartman	15	0	Maybe so, but at least I was smart enough to wear a Kidney Blocker 2000!	[]
Stan	11	1	God-dammit, don't you care that Kyle is gonna die?!	['dammit']
Cartman	14	0	I do! I do care! Look how much.  Look. Look how much I care.	[]
Publisher	15	0	First and foremost, Mr. Garrison, I would like to thank you for choosing Harequin Romance.	[]
Mr. Garrison	7	0	Yeahyeahyeah. So, did you read the book?	[]
Publisher	9	0	Uh yes, Mr. Garrison, we did read your book.	[]
Mr. Garrison	5	0	Well, what did you think?	[]
Publisher	19	0	Well, uh, frankly, Mr. Garrison, n-we don't know if the Harequin Romance label is appropriate for you.	[]
Mr. Garrison	3	0	Ooohhh, why not??	[]
Publisher	20	1	Mr. Garrison, uh... are you aware that the word penis occurs six-thousand and eighty-three times in your novel?	['penis']
Mr. Garrison	15	0	Well, I'm sure there's lots of naughty words. It is a romance novel.	[]
Publisher	14	0	Nnnno, I don't think that this book really qualifies as a romance novel.	[]
Mr. Garrison	1	0	No?	[]
Publisher	18	2	No. No, this is what we in the book-publishing business like to call... gay. Really, really gay.	['gay', 'gay']
Mr. Garrison	7	1	What the hell are you talkin' about?!	['hell']
Publisher	14	0	It's just that the focus really seems to be on the... male organs.	[]
Mr. Garrison	11	0	Well, I thought it was mostly women that read these things!	[]
Publisher	2	0	It is.	[]
Mr. Garrison	64	2	Well, women want to read about ding-dongs! D'you think women care about the details of female anatomy?! Hell no! Women wanna read about big, powerful schlongs!  Look, I've seen women read these things. They skim along and skim along until they get to the part about the penis! That's what they want, so that's what I'm giving them!	['hell', 'penis']
Publisher	1	0	Hmmm.	[]
Stan	22	0	There's nothing more I can do, Kenny. I've tried everything to save Kyle. Holistic medicine is gonna kill my friend!	[]
Kenny	8	0	(You never seem to care when I die!)	[]
Stan	25	0	My friend is gonna die! He's gonna die and there's nothing I can do about it.  Oh, God, he's my best friend...	[]
Kenny	19	1	(Well now, that does it! I have had enough of this bullshit! Screw you, Stan. I'm going home!)	['bullshit']
Mover	3	0	Look out!  Oops.	[]
Stan	7	0	Awgh! I'll never see Kyle again!	[]
Mrs.Tucker	6	1	Four dozen Cherokee hair tampons, please.	['tampons']
Chief Running Pinto	8	0	No problem, man. Pay Miss Information up front.	[]
Man 7	16	1	Hi, uh, I have a little bit of pain in my balls whenever I watch VH1.	['balls']
Carlos Ramirez	12	0	Oh, here, try this, man. Ah, this is allll-naturalll ball juice.	[]
Man 7	5	0	Wow, I feel better already!	[]
Miss Information	8	0	And next we have Mrs. Broflovski's son.	[]
Sheila	4	0	Okay, here he is.	[]
Chief Running Pinto	6	0	Ahahem, that kid looks really sick.	[]
Miss Information	8	0	Yes. He really needs his toxins flushed again.	[]
Chief Running Pinto	16	0	No. I mean, he looks REALLY sick, man. You should take him to, like, a doctor.	[]
Customers	1	0	Hmm?	[]
Sheila	9	0	But you're more in touch with the earth.	[]
Chief Running Pinto	14	0	Look, bein' in touch with the earth has nothing to do with dyin', man.	[]
Sharon	12	0	It's okay. We trust that you know what you're doing.	[]
Carlos Ramirez	26	0	No, man, that kid needs a doctor! And besides, we're not actually Native Americans. I mean, I'm- I'm more like a- a Mexican.	[]
Customers	1	0	What?!	[]
Man	2	0	Hu-uh?!	[]
Carlos Ramirez	3	0	Yeah. A Mexican.	[]
Man 7	3	0	Uugh.  Ptu, ptu.	[]
Man 8	5	0	I didn't know that.	[]
Gerald	3	0	Oh my God!	[]
Sharon	7	0	How dare you deceive us like that!	[]
Chief Running Pinto	13	0	Hey, we never said we were Native Americans, man. Miss Information said that.	[]
Carlos Ramirez	9	0	Yeah. She said nobody would buy anything from Mexicans.	[]
Miss Information	5	0	Uh, toxins are your enemy.	[]
Woman 1	2	0	Kill her!	[]
Carlos Ramirez	1	0	Funny.	[]
Stan	9	0	So NOW can we take Kyle to the hospital?	[]
Sheila	11	0	Yes, of course, but we don't have a kidney donor!	[]
Stan	14	0	That's alright. If you'll all help, I think I have a plan.	[]
Cartman	10	1	Oohh, morning, hum, hmyeah. HWAA!  That son of a bitch!	['bitch']

Stan	5	0	Dude, please. Kyle needs it.	[]
Cartman	19	1	It's MINE! Not yours, MINE! Give it back right now, or there's gonna be HELL to pay!	['hell']

Cartman	17	0	Thank you. And you'd better hope to God it still works, just like it did before.	[]
Nurse	5	0	Doctor, Eric Cartman is here-	[]
Dr. Doctor	4	0	Why, hello there, Eric.	[]
Cartman	21	1	You see that?! That's MINE! My asshole friend Stan took my kidney, and I need it put back in!  Please.	['asshole']
Dr. Doctor	24	0	Oh, I see.  Are you sure that now that it's already out, you don't wanna just let your friend Kyle have it?	[]

Stan	8	0	Kyle's all better, Cartman, thanks to you!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Huh?	[]
Stan	27	0	It was all a trick. Your mom undid the kidney blocker, and then we put ketchup on your bed so you'd think we took your kidney.	[]

Kyle	3	0	Huh?  What the?	[]
Cartman	7	1	Oh good, you got the crappy kidney.	['crappy']
