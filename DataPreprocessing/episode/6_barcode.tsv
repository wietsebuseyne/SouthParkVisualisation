Phillip	13	2	Hey Terrance, now that you've farted, I think I might fart too.	['farted', 'fart']
Terrance	3	1	Ohhh, you farted.	['farted']
Sheila	6	0	Kyle, bubbe, what are you watching?	[]
Terrance	7	0	Hey Phillip, would you like a flower?	[]
Phillip	4	0	I sure would Terrance.	[]
Terrance	7	0	Alrighty then, here's a two-lip.	[]
Sheila	6	0	What is this?  It's horrible!	[]
Kyle	5	0	Dude, it's Terrance & Phillip.	[]
Phillip	5	1	Take that you stupid dick.	['dick']
Sheila	4	0	What did he say?	[]
Terrance	5	1	You're an asshole Phillip.	['asshole']
Sheila	16	0	Whatwhatwhaaat?!!?  Young man, you are not to watch that show anymore! It's immature toilet humor!	[]
Kyle	5	0	But everybody watches Terrance & Phillip.	[]
Sheila	5	0	Oh really? Is that so?	[]
Terrance	10	1	Oh no Phillip, looks like you're about to fart.	['fart']
Phillip	6	0	You're exactly right Terrance. Oh.	[]
Terrance	2	0	Oh no.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Ha, ha, ha, that's sweet!	[]
Liane	27	0	Eric dear? I just got a call from your friend Kyle's mother. She said that this show is naughty, and might make you a potty mouth.	[]
Cartman	13	2	That's a bunch of crap! Kyle's mom is a dirty Jew!	['crap', 'jew']
Liane	3	0	Ohhh, okay hon.	[]
Stan	8	0	I'm not going to kill you grampa!	[]
Grampa	1	0	Ingrate!	[]
Stan	3	0	Good night grampa.	[]
Grampa	6	1	You pompous son of a whore!	['whore']
Student	5	0	Huh huh, I had another ...	[]
Kyle	7	1	Ow! What the hell was that for?!	['hell']
Cartman	14	0	That's for your stupid mother! She made me miss Terrance & Phillip last night!	[]
Clyde	15	0	Yeah, what's the big idea having your mom call all our moms last night?	[]
Kyle	14	0	Well I didn't have her do it. She did it on her own.	[]
Cartman	36	1	Why does this happen every month? It seems like, right around the same time every month, Kyle's mom gets a hair up her ass about something and I always end up getting screwed by it!	['ass']
Mr. Garrison	11	0	Children! Children! A certain student's mother called me last night.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Oh, gee, I wonder who's mother that could have been?	[]
Mr. Garrison	17	0	She informed me that some of you might be watching a, a naughty show called Terrance & Phillip.	[]
Class	2	0	Yeahh, woohoo!	[]
Mr. Hat	7	0	Watching that show is bad, Mr. Garrison.	[]
Mr. Garrison	66	0	That's right Mr. Hat, shows like Terrance & Phillip are what we call 'toilet humor.' They don't expand your minds.  You see children, these kind of shows are senseless, vile trash.  Kenny, why are you late to class?  Oh, okay Kenny, be seated.  Now, as I was saying, the reason that parents of South Park are so upset is because...  Yes Kenny, what is it?	[]
Kenny	5	0	(I have to go pee.)	[]
Mr. Garrison	8	0	I thought you just came from the bathroom.	[]
Kenny	6	0	(I did, I gotta go again...)	[]
Mr. Garrison	79	1	Okay okay, go ahead.  As I was saying, you all seem to enjoy this show, even though it isn't based in reality. There's much more to life than two young men farting on each other. And throughout history there have always been shows that have come and gone that have been very bad, and usually they get taken right off the air. You see, you should be spending your time enlightening your minds with more intelligent entertainment.	['farting']
Stan	10	0	Whoa, smells like you slaughtered a cow in there Kenny!	[]
Mr. Garrison	22	0	Pay attention children!  I'm going to join your parents in requesting that you don't watch Terrance & Phillip any more, ever.	[]
Cartman	1	0	What?	[]
Clyde	5	0	Not watch Terrance & Phillip ever?	[]
Mr. Garrison	10	0	That's right children. Are there any questions?  Yes, Stanley?	[]
Stan	11	0	Is it okay to kill somebody if they want you to?	[]
Mr. Garrison	5	0	What, what do you mean?	[]
Stan	18	0	My grampa keeps asking that I kill him all the time, and sometimes I wonder if I should.	[]
Kyle	17	0	Well, then you should. I think that a person has a right to die if they wanna.	[]
Stan	1	0	Really??	[]
Kyle	28	0	Yeah, there's this guy named Jack Leborkian that goes around and murders people that ask him to, and he doesn't get in any trouble at all.	[]
Stan	1	0	Wow!	[]
Cartman	10	0	Hey, maybe we can get him to Kyle's mom!	[]
Stan	11	0	So, is it okay to assist somebody with suicide, Mr. Garrison?	[]
Mr. Garrison	13	0	Uh, Stan, I'm not touching that one with a twenty-foot pole.	[]
Kenny	4	0	(Oh my God!)  (Owww!)	[]
Cartman	19	0	Man! I can't believe we're gonna miss Terrance & Phillip today. I think I'm already having withdrawal.	[]
Stan	21	0	Don't worry dude, we can all go watch it at my house. My parents don't get home until late.	[]
Kyle	7	0	But won't your grampa be there?	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah...	[]
Cartman	11	0	Just kill 'im dude, maybe he'll give you some money.	[]
Chef	3	0	Hello there children.	[]
Stan	2	0	Hey Chef.	[]
Chef	4	0	How's it goin'?	[]
Stan	1	0	Bad.	[]
Chef	2	0	Why bad?	[]
Stan	8	0	Chef, is it okay to kill your grampa?	[]
Chef	12	0	You can't kill my grampa Stan, he's already passed on.	[]
Stan	6	0	No, I mean, kill my grampa.	[]
Chef	16	0	No, I don't think that's okay Stan. In fact, I think that's illegal.	[]
Stan	5	0	See, I told you dude.	[]
Kyle	22	0	Well, yeah, but what if the grampa wants to die, cause he's really old, and he's just asking for help?	[]
Cartman	7	0	Yeah, like assisted suicide. What about that?	[]
Chef	12	0	I don't want to touch that with a forty foot pole.	[]
Stan	12	0	What's the big deal? Why won't anybody talk about this.	[]
Sheila	22	0	And I myself was not aware of this horrible show until recently. I have a clip to demonstrate exactly what I mean.	[]
Terrance	4	0	Hey Phillip, guess what?	[]
Phillip	1	0	What?	[]
Terrance	1	1	Fart.	['fart']
Sheila	8	0	Now apparently, that's supposed to be funny.	[]
Randy	11	1	Heh, heh, heh, he farted right on his head, heh heh,	['farted']
Sheila	22	0	Not allowing our kids to watch this show is not enough. We need to boycott the entire network! All those in favor...	[]
Mr. Garrison	23	0	Ohh, I think I've caught a touch of the flu from little Kenny this morning. I've got the green apple splatters.	[]
Townsman	5	0	Ha ha, green apple splatters.	[]
Grampa	1	0	Uhhhh	[]
Stan	14	0	Hi grampa, I brought my friends over to watch TV, if that's okay.	[]
Grampa	9	0	Billy, help grampa stick this fork in the outlet.	[]
Stan	7	0	No grampa, I'll get in trouble.	[]
Grampa	4	1	Kill me, God dammit!	['dammit']
Stan	8	0	No, I can't even kill a deer.	[]
Grampa	17	0	Well then, have one of your little friends do it. You can kill me can't ya?	[]
Cartman	11	0	I would never kill somebody... not unless the piss me off.	[]
Grampa	26	1	Ohh, is that a fact? Well, let me tell you something, Porky. Your mom was over here earlier, and I humped her like a little bitch.	['bitch']
Cartman	1	0	What!	[]
Grampa	3	0	That's right.	[]
Stan	1	0	Grampa!	[]
Grampa	17	0	And then, I dug up your great-grandma's skeleton, and had my way with her too.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Hey!	[]
Grampa	7	1	Choice piece of ass, your great-grandma.	['ass']
Cartman	8	1	You piece of crap! I'll kill you!	['crap']
Grampa	5	0	That's the spirit Tubby.	[]
Stan	11	0	Come on Cartman, he's just trying to get to you.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Don't talk about my mom like that!	[]
Stan	9	0	We can go watch Terrance & Phillip in the kitchen.	[]
Grampa	12	1	I ever tell you about the time I boofed your dad, Fatso?	['fatso']
Cartman	10	1	Ah, I can't believe that son of a bitch!	['bitch']
Stan	6	0	Here Cartman, have some Snacky Cakes.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Oooh, Snacky Cakes, god dang.	[]
Stan	14	0	I don't know what to do dude, my grampa really wants to die.	[]
Kyle	15	0	I'm telling you, it's okay. Maybe you should ask the Lord for guidance.	[]
Stan	2	0	Hey, yeah!	[]
TV Announcer	12	0	And now, back to 'Jesus and Pals' on South Park Public Access.	[]
Jesus	17	0	Yea, believe in me and ye shall find peace.  First caller, you're on 'Jesus and Pals'	[]
Caller	4	0	Yeah, is this Jesus?	[]
Jesus	19	0	Yes, yes caller, you need to turn your TV down, that's why you're getting that weird feedback.	[]
Caller	6	0	Oh, sorry.  Uh, this is Martin...	[]
Jesus	7	0	Martin, from Aspen Park, yes, I know.	[]
Martin	7	1	How the hell'd you know that?	['hell']
Jesus	16	0	Well, maybe because I'm the Son of God, brainiac, now, do you have a question?	[]
Martin	15	0	Uh, yeah, uh, I have this cousin who, who cheated on the SAT's and-	[]
Jesus	16	0	Tell little Gregory that cheating is lying and lying is wrong, no matter what the circumstance.	[]
Martin	8	0	Oh, oh, okay, thanks for the advice, Jesus.	[]
Jesus	7	0	Next caller, you're on the air.	[]
Stan	1	0	Jesus?	[]
Jesus	3	0	Yes my son?	[]

Stan	7	1	Kyle, don't be such a butthole!	['butthole']
Cartman	18	1	Yeah, just cause your mom is a stupid bitch doesn't mean the whole world has to suffer.	['bitch']
Kyle	8	1	Don't call my mom a bitch, Cartman!	['bitch']

Grampa	9	0	Billy, would you mind holding this for grampa please?	[]
Stan	12	0	Okay grampa, okay, just get out of the way of the TV.	[]
Terrance	11	1	Hey Phillip, it looks like those beans might make me fart.	['fart']
Phillip	7	1	Well, don't fart on me Terrance.	['fart']
Cartman	9	1	Dude, he's gonna fart on his head again.	['fart']
Kenny	3	0	(Oh my God!)	[]

Shelly	11	1	No, I mean, what the hell are you doing to grampa?!	['hell']
Grampa	5	0	Tug - a - little harder, Billy.	[]
Stan	1	0	Aaah!!	[]
Grampa	2	0	Uh, ow.	[]
Shelly	13	1	You little jerk!  You were trying to kill grampa! I'm telling mom!	['jerk']
Grampa	5	1	Dammit! I was so close.	['dammit']
TV Announcer	16	0	Four third graders from South Park, Colorado, were found trying to viciously murder an innocent grandfather.	[]
Talk Show Host	19	1	Boys, how did you get driven so far to the edge? What changed you into such demonic little bastards?	['bastards']
Stan	17	0	We didn't know what we were doing. We were just sitting there, watching Terrance & Phillip and...	[]
Talk Show Host	12	0	Terrance & Phillip, aha! So it is that show that is to blame.	[]
Sheila	19	0	These boys minds have been tainted by the garbage on television that they see, and we are fed up!	[]
Crowd	1	0	Woooo!	[]
Townsman	5	0	Huh? Oh god! Oh god!	[]
Sheila	29	0	We have to stop this smut from going on the air. We will march to the network and protest until our demands are met. New York, here we come!	[]
Sheila	24	0	We are spreading the word to this establishment that we demand better television, for our children!  We want more quality television, like Full House.	[]
Randy	11	0	Oh, I think you gave me the stomach flu, Mr. Garrison.	[]
Mr. Garrison	13	1	No, no, it was that little Kenny bastard that gave it to me.	['bastard']
Randy	12	0	Whoa, Mayor, you, uh, making gravy in there? Heh, heh, heh, heh.	[]
Mayor	7	0	I just had a brown baby boy.	[]
Stan	8	0	Dude, this is sweet, not having parents around.	[]
Kyle	8	0	Yeah, I hope they protest TV shows forever.	[]
All	1	0	Whoopeee!	[]
Grampa	9	0	Come here Billy, I want to show you something.	[]
Stan	5	0	Aww, do I have to?	[]
Grampa	43	0	Yes you do, you little pecker! I realized that the reason you won't kill me  is because you don't understand how I feel, Billy, but now I found a way to show you what it feels like to be a grampa.	[]
Stan	5	0	Hey, what are you doing?!	[]
Kyle	6	0	What are they doing in there?	[]
Cartman	4	0	I don't know.	[]
Grampa	20	0	Now, you're about to see what it's like to be as old as me. Are you ready Billy?	[]
Stan	11	0	Uh, I guess.  Okay, you, you can let me out now.	[]
Grampa	3	0	Not just yet.	[]
Stan	28	0	Let me out grampa!  I can't take it anymore, this music is terrible, it's, it's cheesy, but lame and eerily soothing at the same time.	[]
Grampa	13	0	That's it, now you know what it feels like to be grampa.	[]
Stan	15	0	Eh, grampa, I had no idea how bad it was for you. Now I understand.	[]
Grampa	7	0	So now will you kill me Billy?	[]
Stan	6	0	Sure I will grampa, I will.	[]
Liane	10	0	Hehh, it doesn't look like our protest is working.	[]
Sheila	6	0	It'll work, it has to.	[]
Townsman	8	0	Look! It's the president of the network.	[]
John Warzog	42	1	Ladies and gentlemen, my name is John Warzog, I've prepared a statement for you on behalf of the network.  Fuck you.  Thank you ladies and gentlemen. If there are any questions, you may direct them to that brick wall over there.	['fuck']

Kyle	3	0	Yep, all done.	[]
Stan	4	0	'Kay, come on guys.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Why don't we just shoot him?	[]
Stan	15	1	You dumbass Cartman, it has to look natural, or else we'll all get busted.	['dumbass']
Kyle	2	0	Yeah, stupid!	[]
Grampa	8	0	That's good Billy, a little higher now.	[]
Cow	1	0	Moooo!	[]
Sheila	69	0	The network is not taking us seriously. In the past, people have had to die for what they believed in, and we are prepared to do the same. Ready?  Mr. McCormick, you shall be a martyr to us all. God Speed. We will not let these corporate half-wits ruin our children's minds. Launch!  We will all follow suit, one by one if that's what it takes.	[]
Stan	4	0	Are you ready grampa?	[]
Grampa	7	1	Does the pope crap in the woods?	['crap']
Police Radio	9	0	7 Mary 5, code 6 - 105 North Avenue 52.	[]
Cow	1	0	Mooo!	[]

Grampa	18	2	It's about time you lazy-ass son of a whore.  Come on, let's go.  What the...?	['ass', 'whore']

Death	1	0	Mooorrrr!	[]
Newscaster	44	0	As the day progresses, more and more South Park residents continue to sling shot their bodies into the side of the 'Toon Central building. Toon Central is now under incredible pressure to cancel the show, and has already lost over 20% of their sponsors.	[]
Sheila	8	0	Here Carol, I think it's your boy.	[]

Randy	6	0	Did you turn the heat down?	[]
Stan	4	0	Dad, Death is coming!	[]
Randy	11	0	Keep the thermostat under 70, and take care of your grandfather.	[]
Death	1	0	Mrrrr!	[]
Stan	42	1	Dammit! You know, I think that if parents would spend less time worrying about what their kids watch on TV, and more time worrying about what's going in in their kid's lives, this world would be a much better place.	['dammit']
Kyle	26	0	Yeah, I think that parents only get so offended by television because the rely on it as a babysitter, and the sole educator of their kids.	[]
Kenny	52	0	(You know what I think? Basically, if you let the decision of what you watch stop at the parents' control, then what can you see? It'll stay the same because they'll just get offended although their kids are not delighted with the television series they put on for their kids.)	[]
Stan	2	0	Totally dude.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Good point man.	[]
Death	1	0	Mrrrr!	[]
Kids	1	0	Ahhhh!	[]

Grampa	8	1	Come over here you son of a whore!	['whore']
Phillip	8	0	Uhh, oh Terrance? What color is the wind?	[]
Terrance	10	0	Hmmm, I don't know, why don't you check?	[]
Phillip	3	1	Oh, you farted.	['farted']
Terrance	2	0	Ohho God.	[]
Terrance	10	0	Hey Phillip, you know what my space suit smells like?	[]
Phillip	8	0	No Terrance, why don't you tell me?	[]
Terrance	7	1	Well, it smells like, a dirty fart!	['fart']
Stan	2	0	Hey look!	[]
Phillip	4	0	Oh, there's one.	[]
Newscaster	54	0	Hours have passed, and still the die hard South Park parents are killing themselves in front of the 'Toon Central building, one by one. Worse yet, the stomach flu that seems to be going around is...  Wait, wait, I'm getting word that the president of the network is going to make a statement!	[]
Townsman	2	0	Wait, wait.	[]
John Warzog	55	0	Ladies and gentlemen, your nazi-esque tactics of trying to stink us out with your rancid feces ... has worked.  Therefore, today we will be officially taking Terrance & Phillip off the network and replacing it with reruns of She's the Sheriff, starring Suzanne Sommers.  Now get away from here, and take your diarrhea with you!	[]
Townsman	3	0	Huh, oh no!	[]
Sheila	8	0	At last, now we can return to normality.	[]
Terrance	2	0	Hey Phillip.	[]
Phillip	2	0	Yes Terrance?	[]

TV Announcer	9	0	We interrupt this program to bring you loud static.	[]
Death	1	0	Mrrrrr!	[]
Kids	1	0	Ahhh!	[]
Kyle	8	1	Oh my God, they killed Kenny. You Bastard!!!	['bastard']
Stan	12	0	Wow, I guess Death was just coming after Kenny the whole time.	[]
Grampa	7	0	Hey, you were supposed to kill me!	[]
Death	1	0	Mrrr.	[]
Grampa	16	1	That's not fair, Goddammit! My grampa asked me to kill him and I did it.	['goddammit']

Grampa	1	0	Grampa?	[]
Great-Great-Grampa	4	0	That's right, Billy.	[]
Grampa	18	0	My name's not Billy, grampa. And what's wrong with you? Why do you look all haggard?	[]
Great-Great-Grampa	21	0	I asked you to kill me Billy, but I was wrong. And now I'm forced to spend eternity in limbo.	[]
Grampa	1	0	Limbo?	[]
Great-Great-Grampa	49	0	I was wrong to put you in that position Billy, just like you're wrong to put Little Billy in it now. You're so obsessed with ending your life, you're not thinking about what you're doing to his. You must wait to die of natural causes.	[]
Grampa	8	0	But I've been waiting for 25 years.	[]
Great-Great-Grampa	16	0	Let nature run its course, or else end up in limbo. Natural causes Billy, natural causes...	[]
Stan	8	0	Come on you guys, let's go home.	[]
Sheila	3	0	Here they are!	[]
