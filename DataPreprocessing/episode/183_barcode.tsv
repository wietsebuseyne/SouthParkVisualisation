Cartman	139	1	The city isn't what it used to be. It all happened so fast. Everything went to crap. It's like... everyone's sense of morals just... disappeared. Bad economy made things worse.  The jobs started drying up. Then the stores had to shut down.  Then a black man was elected President. He was supposed to change things.  He didn't.  As more and more people turned to crime and violence the town becomes gripped in fear. Dark times. The city needs protection.  There is an animal that lives by night, searches the trashcans and cleans out the garbage.  To clean out the trashcan of society I've chosen to become more than a man.  I'm the hero this town needs. I am...  the Coon!  As the world plummets into despair the Coon fights to keep order intact.	['crap']
Josh	8	0	Lisa I had a really great time tonight.	[]
Lisa	4	0	I did too, Josh.	[]
Josh	8	0	Would you... mind very much if kissed you?	[]
Lisa	3	0	Not at all.	[]
The Coon	26	1	A woman being raped. This is what our city has been reduced to. When the money goes, the raping starts. Women are helpless... without the Coon.	['raped']
Lisa	5	0	O-hoh, yes Josh. Yehehessss!	[]
The Coon	3	0	Let her go!	[]
Josh	2	0	'Scuse me?	[]
The Coon	6	0	You aren't raping anyone tonight!	[]
Josh	7	0	Oh, it's a talking squirrel.  Oh!	[]
Lisa	1	0	Ah!	[]
Josh	4	0	Oh! Ow! Wugh! Oh!	[]
The Coon	7	0	Get out of here! Get to safety!	[]
Josh	7	0	Ugh! L-lisa! Call me! Oh! Ow!	[]
The Coon	13	1	Another woman saved from rape. But how many more rapists are out there?	['rape']
Josh	4	0	Oh that really stings.	[]
Officer 1	9	0	Here's that file on the Rodriguez case, detective.	[]
Sgt. Yates	23	0	Alright, things are pretty quiet out there, boys. Let's try to get caught up on some paperwork. Murphy I want you to-	[]
The Coon	14	0	Don't let the city's peacefulness fool you, commissioner! It's too quiet.	[]
Sgt. Yates	5	0	Oh, not this kid again.	[]
Officer 1	7	0	Hey, you get out of here. Out.	[]
The Coon	24	0	There was another rapist in the park tonight.  It's no coincidence. It must be a rapist plot and at stinks to the top.	[]
Sgt. Yates	1	0	What?	[]
The Coon	22	0	I think the Mayor might be involved. It's my theory she might have a lesbian lover who's holding her leash.	[]
Sgt. Yates	16	0	Jesus Christ,  can we get a lock on that window?  Look kid, you need to stop-	[]
Officer 1	3	0	He's gone.	[]
The Coon	17	1	No, I'm just over here now.  What do we know about the Mayor's sexual preferences?	['sexual']
Sgt. Yates	21	0	Alright, listen: you have five seconds to leave or we're gonna put you in the jail and call your parents!	[]
Officer 1	4	0	Jail's full, sir.	[]
Sgt. Yates	8	0	Whatever. Then we'll just put you in-	[]
The Coon	6	0	Now I'm back over here.	[]
Sgt. Yates	7	0	Just get out of here before we-!	[]
The Coon	5	0	I'm right here now.	[]
Sgt. Yates	4	0	All right, stop it!	[]
The Coon	28	0	Yes, I have to go now.  But in the meantime I have something that might interest you.  Make sure all your men get a look at these, detective!	[]
Sgt. Yates	4	0	What's in here?	[]
Cartman	24	1	Hey guys. Good morning.  You guys... hear that another rape victim got saved by a superhero last night? They say it was the Coon.	['rape']
Stan	4	0	Who's the Coon?	[]
Cartman	63	0	I know, right?  Who is the Coon? It's what everyone must be asking themselves. Somebody is dressing up at night and taking the law into their own hands. As for me, I certainly don't agree with the Coon's reckless ways. If you ask me, there's no room in this world for vigilantes. I believe the Coon is a menace.	[]
Kyle	12	1	...Yeah, and dressing up and running around at night is faggy anyway.	['faggy']
Cartman	7	2	You're a fag, Kyle! Fuck you!	['fag', 'fuck']
Kyle	2	0	...Dude, what?!	[]
Cartman	5	1	He's not a fag!	['fag']
Kyle	4	0	Why do you care?	[]
Cartman	66	2	Oh. I uh... well I ah ah  I'm just... I'm just mad 'cause you should never use the term fag, Kyle. That's a hate word. And it's insensitive to butt pirates. Anyway, what do you think about the Coon, Stan and Kenny? Do you think he's the savior this town needs or do you think he's a dangerous vigilante?  Kenny?	['fag', 'butt']
Cartman	136	0	And of course the most common question asked is, just who is he?  Is he a hero or a menace?  While we can all admit that the Coon is obviously really cool, we should also be asking each other... Why does he care so much for the people of this town? Why does he sacrifice himself every night to rid our streets of crime? And does he really have the right? What we all need now-  Clyde? Clyde, could you wake up please? This is important.  What we all need now is PROOF... that the Coon exists. I believe that tonight from approximately 5 to 5:45 the Coon is going to be on the roof of Walgreens. I know I'll be there with my camera. And I'm sure... many of you will, too.	[]
The Coon	71	3	Sometimes it seems the more criminals I try to stop, the more just come out of the back alleys and dilapidated bars. The city is a dying whore. She calls out to me to save her. And I don't know if I can. But she is still my city.  And I cannot just sit and watch as innocent peole are-  Who the hell is that?  Who the hell are you?	['whore', 'hell', 'hell']
M	34	0	I'm an angel keeping watch over the city at night. As violence and darkness take over the streets, I work to rid this city of crime. I'm the symbol this town needs.	[]
The Coon	25	0	Aw nonononono, I am the symbol this town needs!  Dude, seriously, you can't do that! Go home! I was, I was doing this first!	[]
M	2	0	Nuh uh.	[]
The Coon	19	0	Yeah huh! You heard of the Coon and now you're being a copycat. Is that your name? Copycat?	[]
M	3	0	I am Mysterion.	[]
The Coon	20	2	Mysterion? That's fucking retarded! You just gave yourself away, Craig! Only you would think of a name that dumb!	['fucking', 'retarded']
Mysterion	20	0	I might be Craig, and then again I might not be. My identity must remain a secret. You cannot know.	[]
The Coon	9	0	Yeah? Well you cannot know my true identity either.	[]
Mysterion	10	1	I assume you must be Cartman, because you're fat.	['fat']
The Coon	18	1	Well you're wrong! I'm not Eric Cartman and he's not fat! Care to guess again?!	['fat']
Mysterion	8	0	I really don't care who you are.	[]
The Coon	43	0	Oh all right Kyle! Yeah, took me real long to figure it out! Only you, Kyle, would be a buzzkill, and try to steal my thunder! You don't care about stopping crime, you're just doing this... 'cause you hate me, Kyle!	[]
Mysterion	11	0	Kyle hates Eric Cartman. Are you saying you're Eric Cartman?	[]
The Coon	29	1	No, I'm no- I  I'm sayin' that... Goddammit Stan is that you? It is you, isn't it? Clyde? Clyde, you're not a superhero, I am!	['goddammit']
Mysterion	20	0	I cannot stand here and make idle conversation any longer. The city needs my help. There are innocents to protect.	[]
The Coon	15	1	NO! Dude, I'm seriously! You're being a copycat! I'll sue you!  Motherfucker!	['motherfucker']
Cartman	78	0	Which one of them is it? Somebody is dressing up and pretending to be a superhero! But who? Has to be one of the guys in my class, 'cause only they knew that the Coon would be on the rooftop of Walgreens.  No, stop. Can't think about that right now. Have to focus.  Tomorrow is the most important day in the Coon's life. Everything the Coon has lived and fought for comes down to tomorrow. Concentrate.	[]
The Coon	16	1	How is it that nobody came to Coonicon 09? This is just, this is fucking ridiculous!	['fucking']
Maitre D	11	0	Got everything you need here, sir? Okay on beverages, buffet items?	[]
The Coon	4	0	Yes, it's fine!	[]
Maitre D	16	0	Great. Hey, I just want to say that the Airport Hilton really appreciates your continued business.	[]
The Coon	12	0	What do you mean continued? You don't know who I am!	[]
Maitre D	18	1	Aren't you that little boy who had his ginger pride rally and his AIDS benefit here, before?	['ginger']
The Coon	6	0	No, I'm not that kid!	[]
Maitre D	18	1	Oh. Oh oh really? Oh my bad. I'm actually relieved. That kid was kind of a douchebag.	['douchebag']
The Coon	8	2	You're a fucking douchebag! Get outta here!	['fucking', 'douchebag']
Cartman	1	0	Hunh!	[]
Liane	8	0	Oh, hello sweetie. What did you do today?	[]
Cartman	19	0	I got boned! That's what I did, Mom! I try to do good stuff and nobody even notices!	[]
Liane	4	0	Aww, what happened, hun?	[]
Cartman	16	0	I can't tell you what happened 'cause it's about my super secret double life!	[]
Anchor	23	0	Tonight an incredible story of an unknown child in South Park who has taken to the streets in an effort to fight crime.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Wha, what?	[]
Anchor	5	0	But who exactly is... Mysterion?	[]
Cartman	1	0	What?!	[]
Anchor	25	0	Curious crowds in the town of South Park, Colorado.  They've brought binoculars and camera phones trying to get a shot of a mysterious superhero.	[]
Man 1	12	0	Uh, he was dressed mostly in black with a kind of... cloak.	[]
Woman 1	21	0	He jumped down from the fire escape stairs, and then he just ran off. We barely got a look at him.	[]
Man 2	15	0	To me it looked like Mysterion to me. Everyone who's seen Mysterion, say yeah!	[]
Crowd	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Man 3	30	0	Well I, I think he's kind of a symbol for the town, you know? A, a symbol.that everyone who's sick of crime can uh can rally behind.	[]
Cartman	2	2	Fuckin' butthole!	['fuckin', 'butthole']
Man 4	19	0	Well if you ask me, he's a menace. There's no room for vigilantism in today's world!	[]
Reporter	11	0	This artist rendition of Mysterion has already generated thousands of copies.	[]
Cartman	5	0	You gotta be kidding me!	[]
Reporter	19	0	As hundreds of people to try and get a glimpse of the superhero, one question remains: Who is Mysterion?	[]
Anchor	17	0	If you have any idea about the true identity of Mysterion, please call the 9 News Hotline.	[]
Cartman	1	0	AAAAAHT!!	[]
Mysterion	57	0	I could no longer sit by and watch as my city became a cesspool of crime.  I have lived in South Park all my life. I decided it was up to me to keep this town safe.  Nobody at school knows my double life. To them, I'm just another fourth grader. But tonight, I am Mysterion.	[]
Sgt. Yates	12	0	Oh, Mysterion, thank God you've come. What news do you have?	[]
Mysterion	28	0	There's some graffiti on the bridge again. I think those sixth grade kids are doing it. And the guy at the movie theater is harassing Mexicans again.	[]
Officer 2	17	0	We'll get right on it, Mysterion. Thank you. Thank you for all your help.  Godspeed, Mysterion!	[]
Sgt. Yates	13	0	You are a beacon of hope in an otherwise bleak and dreary world!	[]
The Coon	16	1	Dude, seriously? I'm gonna kick the shit out of you if you don't stop!	['shit']
Mysterion	12	0	This city needs my help. It cries for protection and I will-	[]
"Mysterion, the Coon"	6	0	Answer the call to save her.	[]
The Coon	16	0	That's what I'm supposed to say! I know it's you, Kyle. Just stop!	[]
Mysterion	19	1	I don't have time for this.  Fireworks are illegal in Colorado, you asshole!  Hey, he's got fireworks!	['asshole']
Cartman	10	0	So, guys! Any of you do anything interesting last night?!	[]
Stan	2	0	Not really.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Really?! Nobody was playing with any fireworks?!	[]
Stan	4	1	Dude, what the hell?	['hell']
Cartman	22	0	Aha! Kenny! I should have known!  Why do you have a picture of Mysterion in your locker, Kenny?!  Unless you are Mysterion!	[]
Stan	11	0	Dude, I have a picture of Mysterion in my locker too.	[]
Clyde	4	0	Yeah, so do I.	[]
Cartman	2	0	What?! Why?	[]
Clyde	10	0	I don't know, it's just a cool costume.	[]
Cartman	25	1	It's not a cool costume! He just wears his underwear over his buttfucking pants! Now, come on, which one of you guys is it?!	['buttfucking']
Wendy	9	0	How are you so sure Mysterion is a boy?	[]
Cartman	2	2	Fucking bitch...	['fucking', 'bitch']
The Coon	28	0	I had no choice.  I was at the end of my rope.  Sometimes when a superhero needs answers, he has to turn to the wretched underbelly of society.	[]
A Voice	7	0	Hahahahahahahahaaa... Look what the cat dragged in.	[]
The Coon	7	0	Come out where I can see you!	[]
A Voice	6	0	What's the matter, Coon? Nervous?	[]
The Coon	16	0	I didn't want to resort to this, but he could have the answers I need.	[]
A Voice	16	0	How utterly delightful! The heroic and mighty Coon  come to put a stop to me again.	[]
The Coon	21	0	Chaos. I need to keep on my toes.  I'm not here to stop you this time, Chaos! I need information.	[]
Professor Chaos	23	0	Oh I'm sure you do. But you see I  whoop.  But you see I also know you like to beat me up.	[]
The Coon	18	0	I didn't call you to fight, Chaos! I came to see if you know Mysterion's identity.	[]
Professor Chaos	20	0	Oh I'm close. And I'll put an end to him, and all of you goody-two-shoe heroes!	[]
The Coon	6	0	I'm not on his side!	[]
Professor Chaos	50	1	Do you think I'm a fool?! All those times you stopped me from my acts of evil! All those times you tricked me into meeting you, and then ga- and then gave me titty-twisters! Not this time, Coon! I finally learned my lesson! Now, General Disarray!  Yeah-ha!	['titty']
The Coon	3	0	That's it!	[]
Professor Chaos	5	0	O- oh careful General Disarray.	[]
The Coon	9	1	Agh- Stop it! You, you... butthole! Knock it off!	['butthole']
Professor Chaos	6	0	Hehyeah! We beat him, General Disarray!	[]
The Coon	12	0	Listen to me! I want to... help you... get rid of Mysterion!	[]
Professor Chaos	10	0	Let him go, General Disarray!  Why would you help us?!	[]
The Coon	28	2	Because Mysterion is trying to  You fucker, that fuckin' hurt!  Because Mysterion is trying to say he's the hero this town needs! But that's my job!	['fucker', 'fuckin']
Professor Chaos	8	0	But you both fight for justice and good.	[]
The Coon	17	2	Yeah, but he's a fuckin' dick! I want him gone just as much as you do!	['fuckin', 'dick']
Professor Chaos	21	0	Very well. I will show you what we know about Mysterion's identity, but if this is some kind of setup-	[]
The Coon	12	0	N- I'm the good guy, Chaos. I don't betray people.	[]
Professor Chaos	3	0	Weh- oh yeah.	[]
The Coon	21	1	I didn't like having to work with this scumbag. But I knew Mysterion was out there, plotting his next move.	['scumbag']
Mysterion	2	0	Hello Kyle.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Whoa, what the?	[]
Mysterion	9	0	Do not be afraid. I mean you no harm.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Hey. Hey, you're that Mysterion kid.	[]
Mysterion	13	0	Yes. But now I believe someone is trying to learn my true identity.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Dude, everyone's trying to figure out who you are.	[]
Mysterion	26	0	I cannot be unmasked, for then I would stop being a symbol. I need help. Somebody who can do background checks for me, do some investigating.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Who? Me? Why?	[]
Mysterion	10	0	Because I think you are the smartest kid in class.	[]
Professor Chaos	12	0	This way! We will now show you our secret headquarters of DOOM.	[]
The Coon	7	0	You guys have your own storage facility?	[]
Professor Chaos	73	0	Actually it belongs to General Disarray's grandma, um but she lets us use it.  This is where we come up with all our evil plans. Here's our computer relays.  And this is like a, a cube of chaos that can destroy the world in one second!  And here's some of our evil minions!  We have everything we need here. Can I offer you a Coke or a Sprite or something?	[]
The Coon	5	0	I'll take a Sprite.	[]
Professor Chaos	21	0	Uhget the Coon a Sprite, General Disarray.  As you can see we too have been working hard on Mysterion's identity.	[]
The Coon	26	0	You have an entire wall dedicated to Mysterion? What about...? Do you, do you still have that Who Is The Coon? T-shirt I gave you?	[]
Professor Chaos	21	0	Oh yeah, I think it's around here somewhere. Uh, using our photos we are tryin' to pinpoint Mysterion's identity.	[]
The Coon	10	0	Why is Cartman crossed out? He, he could be Mysterion.	[]
Professor Chaos	19	1	No, he's too fat. Based on his body type it's gotta be someone like Stan or Kyle.	['fat']
The Coon	26	0	Alright, al, alright, alright, look, Chaos. Just set up a video camera. I know how we can put an end to Mysterion once and for all.	[]
Anchor	31	0	The clock is ticking and the citizens of South Park are gripped in fear. Two days ago an evil unknown terrorist threatened major consequences if Mysterion  does not reveal his identity.	[]
Professor Chaos	62	1	Mark my words, South Park! Your precious hero is now, uh, your undoing! If Mysterion does not unmask himself publicly by Wednesday night, I am going to blow up... a hospital. Blow up a hospital?  I'm not gonna blow up any hospital. Are you nuts? What?  Uh, the choice is yours, Mysterion! Unmask yourself or hundreds will die! Hahaha.  Jesus Christ.	['nuts']
Anchor	15	0	Since the threat was issued there has been no sign of Mysterion. Where is Mysterion?	[]
Anchor 2	3	0	Where is Mysterion?	[]
Professor Chaos	14	0	Hey Coon w-we aren't actually gonna blo- blow up anything, are we?	[]
The Coon	16	0	If you don't make good on your threats, Chaos, then what good are your threats?	[]
Professor Chaos	17	0	But you really wanna blow up a hospital? I mean, a-aren't you a good guy?	[]
The Coon	10	0	Sometimes blowing up hospitals is for the greater good, Chaos.	[]
General Disarray	24	0	You know, I've been thinking: if we're really evil villains, then we should betray him, and blow him up with the hospital.	[]
The Coon	37	2	You know, you're a little scrotum-licker dude! Why don't you shut the fuck up?!  Alright Chaos, I'm gonna get the triggers for these things at ACE Hardware. Keep an eye on this stuff!	['scrotum', 'fuck']
Professor Chaos	42	1	Aww jeez General Disarray, this is a lot more than I ever really intended.  I mean, well I hate the world and all its beauty and happiness and all but, but blowin' up a hospital? It just seems mean.  Whoa. Oh hamburgers!	['hamburgers']
General Disarray	1	0	AAAGH!	[]
Professor Chaos	14	0	Aaah, a m m Mysterion, I b-, I beg you, I mean ah, judahadahada...	[]
Mysterion	12	0	Why are you doing this?! This isn't your usual MO, Chaos!	[]
Professor Chaos	29	0	Whowell I b- Well I b- ah I just would jes one nigh-, and then the Coon saw it up and I wa able to, and was able to	[]
Professor Chaos	1	0	Waaugh!	[]
Man 5	3	0	What is that?	[]
Man 6	7	0	Look! Mysterion and Professor Chaos are fighting!	[]
Man 7	4	1	Give him hell, Mysterion!	['hell']
Woman 2	8	0	Look out Mysterion! General Disarray is behind you!	[]
Officer 3	7	0	Jesus Christ, we need backup out here!	[]
Officer 4	10	0	I think I can get a shot at Chaos, sir.	[]
Sgt. Yates	7	0	You think your bullets can hurt him?	[]
Professor Chaos	4	0	Yeah, we did it!	[]
Man 8	6	0	He's dead. Mysterion is dead.	[]
Woman 3	1	0	Nooo...	[]
Reporter	17	0	The impossible has happened. Mysterion, beloved protector of the city, is dead. Who will save us now?	[]
Man 9	2	0	Wait! Look!	[]
Officer 4	4	0	He's all right!	[]
Cartman	9	0	Oh my God, look everyone, it's the Coon!	[]
The Coon	10	0	Fear not everyone! Coon is here to save the day.	[]
Man 10	5	0	Isn't that Bruce Vilanch?	[]
Man 11	11	0	Be careful Bruce Vilanch! There are superhumans fighting right over there!	[]
Professor Chaos	13	0	Okay sorry sorry! I'm sorry! I give up! Please, I give up!	[]
The Coon	10	0	Don't worry, Mysterion!  The Coon will now help you!	[]
Professor Chaos	17	0	Well, wait! I thought we were workin' together.  Waaa.  Oh jeez, I think I broke a tooth.	[]
The Coon	12	0	That was great teamwork, Mysterion. South Park is safe. Until next time.	[]
Mysterion	3	0	What next time?	[]
The Coon	34	0	Well, people are obviously so desperate to learn your identity that they'll do anything. Won't be long before the next villain comes along and threatens violence unless you take off your mask.	[]
Mysterion	13	0	Citizens, tonight has shown me I have no choice but to unmask myself.	[]
Sgt. Yates	21	0	Don't do it, Mysterion! If you show your identity we'll be forced to arrest you for being a vigilante	[]
The Coon	21	0	Don't you think he knows that?! But superheroes know that sometimes you have to sacrifice yourself for the greater good.	[]
Man 12	6	0	Don't show your face, Mysterion!	[]
Man 13	6	0	You have to be a symbol!	[]
The Coon	15	0	So that the next terrorist can threaten South Park if he doesn't unmask himself?!	[]
Mysterion	28	0	No, it's true. As long as my identity is a mystery, this will just happen again and again. It has to end. I will show my face.	[]
Crowd	1	0	Ohhh.	[]
Man 14	4	0	Well I'll be.	[]
The Coon	11	0	I knew it was you! 'Member I even said it before!	[]
Mr. Garrison	8	0	Wow, a kid from my class was Mysterion.	[]
Sgt. Yates	14	0	Well I'm sorry but you're under arrest. Take the kid to jail.	[]
The Coon	50	0	My entire plan worked to perfection.  My work here is done.  With Mysterion out of the way the Coon can finally go back to keeping the city safe.  Once again, I alone am the symbol this town can stand behind.  Every town needs a hero.  Every town needs... a Coon.	[]
