Cartman	3	0	What's homecoming?	[]
Chef	38	0	But just remember what I taught you. That football is like making love to a reeeeeally beautiful woman. You can't always score, but when you do, it makes all the trying worthwhile.  Now, let's start practice.	[]

Cartman	11	1	Wait a minute, why the hell does he get an A-?	['hell']
Mr. Garrison	31	0	Eric, Stanley just might lead our team to victory against the Middle Park Cowboys for the first time in decades. And we treat star athletes better 'cause they're better people.	[]
Cartman	4	0	That's not fair!	[]
Mr. Hat	9	0	Life isn't fair kiddo, get used to it.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Stupid puppet.	[]

Stan	4	1	What's a - homosexual?	['homosexual']
Mr. Garrison	70	2	Hoh, well, Stanley, I guess you came to the right person. Sit down.  Stanley, gay people... well- gay people are evil. Evil right down to their cold black hearts, which pump not blood like yours and mine, but rather a thick, vomitous oil that oozes through their rotten veins and clots in their pea-sized brains which becomes the cause of their Naziesque patterns of violent behavior. Do you understand?	['gay', 'gay']
Stan	2	0	I guess.	[]
Mr. Garrison	23	1	Good, I'm glad we could have this little talk Stanley. Now you go outside and practice football like a good little heterosexual.	['heterosexual']

Stan	11	0	Shut up dude!  Sparky, where'd you get that pink scarf?	[]
Sparky	2	0	Bark, bark.	[]
Cartman	10	1	Man, that is the gayest dog I've ever seen.	['gayest']

Stan	13	1	Atta boy Spark, get her.  Yes!  Ah crap! Now what do I do?	['crap']
Kyle	13	1	Who cares if your dog is gay? Maybe it's not that bad.	['gay']
Cartman	19	1	No way dude, my mom says God hates gay people. That's why he smote those sodomies in France.	['gay']
Kenny	9	1	(I think that Garrison said that gay people suck.)	['gay']
Stan	16	1	I know Mr. Garrison said that homosexuals are evil, but, but Sparky doesn't seem evil.	['homosexuals']
Kyle	11	0	Well, maybe Mr. Garrison is wrong. You should ask somebody else.	[]
Stan	2	0	Like who?	[]

Pip	17	0	Righto, but how about I use a helmet today, and one of the other children goes without?	[]
Chef	13	0	That wouldn't be very fair to the other children, now would it?	[]
Pip	5	0	No um, I guess not.	[]
Jimbo	26	0	What we'll have to do here Carl is put a trigger on that bomb that makes it go off at a specific moment during halftime.	[]
Carl	5	0	What moment would that be?	[]
Jimbo	27	0	Well, John Stamos' older brother is all set to sing 'Loving You' during halftime. We want that bomb to go off when he hits that high F.	[]
