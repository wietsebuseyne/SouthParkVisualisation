Dr. Doctor	13	0	It's a good thing we got her to the hospital in time.	[]
Sharon	6	0	But what's wrong with her?	[]
Dr. Doctor	25	0	It's chickenpox. There seems to be a small epidemic going around. Your daughter never had the chickenpox as a little child, I take it?	[]
Sharon	7	0	No, no, she's been perfectly healthy.	[]
Dr. Doctor	29	0	Well, that's the problem. You see, chickenpox is a pretty normal thing for young children, but as you get older it becomes a more and more ferocious disease.	[]
Sharon	12	0	Shelly, look who's come to visit you; your little brother, Stan.	[]
Shelly	3	0	Oh, whoo-peee!	[]
Dr. Doctor	15	0	You know, most people don't realize that chickenpox is actually a form of herpes.	[]
Stan	8	0	Dude, you've got herpes on your face!	[]
Shelly	3	0	Shut up, brat!	[]
Sharon	5	0	Will my daughter be okay?	[]
Dr. Doctor	4	0	She'll be fine.	[]
Shelly	2	0	Stop it!	[]
Dr. Doctor	10	0	We just want to be cautious and monitor her here.	[]
Stan	1	0	Ow!	[]
Sharon	14	0	Come on, Stanley. Give your sister a kiss and then we have to go.	[]
Sharon	32	0	...and then the doctor said that it's much worse as you get older. My daughter is in pretty bad shape now, but if she were in her twenties, she could die.	[]
Sheila	11	0	My God, I never knew chickenpox was such a dangerous illness.	[]
Liane	13	0	I guess it's much better to get it when you're young.	[]
Sharon	35	0	So tell me if I'm crazy, but I started thinking that we should intentionally have our boys play with a child who has the chickenpox. Let them get it now, while they're young.	[]
Sheila	13	0	That's not crazy at all, Sharon. Mothers do it all the time.	[]
Liane	29	0	Oh, yes. When I was a child, my mother had me go over to a little girl's house who had the chickenpox, just so I would get it.	[]
Sharon	10	0	So it's not such a crazy idea after all?	[]
Sheila	17	0	Noo, no. And I'm pretty sure that strange little boy Kenny has the chickenpox right now.	[]
Kyle	8	0	Are you guys having a meeting or something?	[]
Sheila	18	0	How would you boys like to have a little slumber party at your friend Kenny's house tonight?	[]
Cartman	13	0	No way, dude. Kenny's family's poor; they live in the ghetto.	[]
Kyle	9	0	Yeah. Let's just have a slumber party here.	[]
Sharon	14	0	Boys, you're going to sleep over at Kenny's, and that's final.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Oh weak!	[]
Kyle	15	0	I wonder why our moms want us to sleep over at Kenny's so bad.	[]
Stan	5	0	Yeah, it's pretty weird.	[]
Kyle	17	0	Well, all I can say is, he's better have Nintendo.  Well, here's Kenny's house.	[]
Cartman	22	0	In the ghetto On a cold and gray Chicago morn  Another little baby child is born In the ghetto... In the ghetto	[]
Stuart	1	0	Yeah?	[]
Stan	10	0	We're here to have a slumber party with Kenny.	[]
Stuart	9	0	What? Don't you know Kenny's sick with--?	[]
Mrs. McCormick	17	0	That's the whole point, remember? Their moms want them to catch it while they're young.	[]
Stuart	2	0	Oh yeah.	[]
Stan	2	0	Catch what?	[]
Mrs. McCormick	11	0	Nothin'. Uhco-uh, come on in, I was jus' makin' dinner.	[]
Cartman	28	0	And his momma cried 'Cause if there's one thing that she don't need Is another little hungry mouth to feed In the ghetto In the ghetto	[]
Stan	2	0	Sshh! Cartman!	[]
Cartman	1	0	What?	[]
Mrs. McCormick	10	0	Kenny, your little friends are here! Come play with them!	[]
Kenny	6	0	(No, Mom, I'm seriously sick!)	[]
Mrs. McCormick	11	0	I know you're sick! Now get your buns out here!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Heheheh, buns.	[]
Kenny	7	0	(Hey you guys, what's goin' on?)	[]
Stan	10	0	Whoa, dude! You've got herpes on your face, too!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Where is the Nintendo?	[]
Stuart	18	0	We don't have a Nintendo. We got a ColecoVision hooked up to the black-and-white TV.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Oh my God. This is like a third-world country.	[]
Mrs. McCormick	14	0	Throw your sleeping bags in Kenny's room and then come grab some dinner.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Oh, good. I'm starving.	[]
Mrs. McCormick	4	0	Let's say grace.	[]
Stuart	52	1	Lord, we thank you for this staggering payload of frozen waffles you have bestowed upon us. And since we have been faithful to you, we know that you will send us some good fortune one of these days, even though you sure as hell seem to be taking your sweet time. Amen.	['hell']
All	1	0	Amen.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Pfff..!	[]
Mrs. McCormick	5	0	Okay, let's dig in.	[]
Kevin	8	0	That one's mine, that one's mine!	[]
Cartman	25	0	What kind of side dishes will we be enjoying this evening with our frozen waffles?  Am I to understand there will be no side dishes?	[]
Stuart	13	1	So, Kyle, your dad's still bringing home those big, fat lawyer paychecks?	['fat']
Kyle	4	0	I don't know.	[]
Mrs. McCormick	6	0	Stuart, don't even get started!	[]
Stuart	52	1	What? I'm just askin' a question.  You know, your dad and I used to be best friends when we were teenagers. We would work together at Pizza Shack. But he got promoted and went off to community college and I didn't. And you know why? 'Cause your dad's Jewish!	['jewish']
Cartman	4	0	Puh! I heard that.	[]
Mrs. McCormick	26	1	That ain't why, Stuart!  It's because you are an alcoholic retard and he had dreams of not eating frozen waffles for dinner every night!	['retard']
Stuart	12	0	Hey, is it my fault you don't know how to cook?!	[]
Mrs. McCormick	20	0	What am I supposed to do with frozen waffles, clamhead?! You put 'em in the toaster and you cook 'em!	[]
Stuart	11	0	You just don't know how to use spices and stuff.	[]
Kevin	11	0	My waffle's d-hun, my waffle's d-hu-hun!	[]
Mrs. McCormick	17	0	Now Kevin, we ain't got enough for everybody. You have to split that with your brother.	[]
Cartman	7	1	Oh, Jesus, are you fucking kidding me?	['fucking']
Stuart	12	2	Hey! We don't say fuck at the table, you little asshole!	['fuck', 'asshole']
Cartman	12	0	Heh, we apparently don't say 'side dishes' at the table, either.	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Aa-choo!)	[]
Mrs. McCormick	11	0	Kenny, honey, if you're going to sneeze, sneeze on them.	[]
Stan	1	0	Huh?	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Waa-choo!)	[]
Cartman	1	0	Ey!	[]
Cartman	13	1	Man, your family sucks ass, Kenny. Whoever heard of frozen waffles for dinner?	['ass']
Kyle	16	0	Come on! Let's just get in our sleeping bags and get this night over with.	[]
Kyle	6	1	Cartman, what the hell is that?	['hell']
Cartman	10	0	It's my Urkel sleeping bag. Isn't it coool?	[]
Kyle	5	0	No, it's not cool!	[]
Stan	8	0	Dude, I think I just saw a rat!	[]
Cartman	9	0	Argh! You have rats in your house, too, Kenny?!	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Uh-huh.)	[]
Cartman	18	0	Dude, seriously, you'd better stop being so poor, or else I'm gonna start huckin' rocks atcha.	[]
Stan	12	0	I don't think it's very healthy to sleep with rats.	[]
Kenny	16	0	(Well, there's gonna be a bunch of rats until they put the freakin' ceiling in.)	[]
Stan	1	0	Oh.	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Aa-choo!)	[]
Sharon	10	0	Okay, lemme see.  Oh, goody! You've got a fever!	[]
Stan	6	0	Goody? What do you mean, goody?!	[]
Sharon	9	0	Yyup, it looks like you've got chickenpox alright.	[]
Stan	12	0	Chickenpo--? Oh no, I must have caught it from Kenny last night.	[]
Sharon	6	0	Oh, gee, I guess you did.	[]
Stan	7	0	Well, you sure seem happy about it!	[]
Sharon	11	0	All right, it's off to bed with you, young man.	[]
Liane	5	0	Don't scratch it, hon.	[]
Cartman	10	0	But mom, seriously, it itches. I can't stand it!	[]
Liane	2	0	No, hon.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Mom, seriously, it itches. It itches!	[]
Liane	7	0	Here, I got you some calamine lotion.	[]
Cartman	4	0	I don't wanna.	[]
Liane	7	0	It'll make your itches go away.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Ugh. Uunnh.  Ey, give me that!  Ahhhh...	[]
Liane	15	0	Not too much, hon. It says on the bottle that too much can be bad.	[]
Cartman	3	0	More calamine lotion!	[]
Sheila	9	0	I don't understand it. He's perfectly healthy.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Yeah. I feel great!	[]
Sheila	10	0	Are you sure you stayed over at Kenny's house?	[]
Kyle	11	0	Yeah, dude. I told you, we had bread sandwiches for breakfast.	[]
Sheila	7	0	Did you sleep in the same room?	[]
Kyle	2	0	Yes. Why?	[]
Sheila	16	0	Bubbe, how would you like to spend the night at your friend Kenny's house again?	[]
Kyle	12	1	No way, dude! It sucked ass! They don't even have cable!	['ass']
Sheila	12	0	Well I think you need to spend more time with your friends.	[]
Kyle	17	1	Kenny's not really my friend, Ma. I don't give a rat's ass about him.	['ass']
Sheila	8	0	I'm gonna give Mrs. McCormick a call.	[]
Kyle	21	0	Aawwww! Hey Dad. Is it true that you and Kenny's dad used to be best friends when you were young?	[]
Gerald	8	0	Who? Stuart? Yeah, yeah, I guess we were.	[]
Kyle	27	0	Well how come Kenny's family eats frozen waffles for dinner and has rats on the floor, and we have a big house and lots of food?	[]
Gerald	14	0	Well, because Kenny's family doesn't have as much money as we do.	[]
Kyle	20	0	But why? If they're hungry and poor, why don't we just always give them half of our food?	[]
Gerald	40	1	Ha ha ha ha ha! Ooh-ho boy, have you got a lot to learn! Sit down, son.  You see, Kyle, we humans work as a society, and in order for a society to thrive, we need gods, and clods.	['ho']
Kyle	3	0	Gods and clods?	[]
Gerald	51	0	Yes. You see, I spent a lot of time going to law school, and I was able to go because I have a slightly higher intellect than others. But I still need people to pump my gas, and make my French fries, and fix my laundry machine when it breaks down.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Oooohh, I see. Gods and clods!	[]
Gerald	23	0	That's right. So Kenny's family is happy just the way they are, and we're all a functioning part of America.	[]
Sharon	18	0	Stanley, can I get you anything else?  Stanley? Oh my God! Randy?! Randy, hurry, he's burning up!	[]
Sharon	11	0	Don't you worry, Stanley, you're going to be okay.	[]
Dr. Doctor	6	0	Can I talk to you outside?	[]
Sharon	10	0	Kids, Daddy and I are gonna be right back, okay?	[]
Stan	1	0	Okay.	[]
Shelly	6	0	Serves you right, you little brat!	[]
Stan	18	0	Well at least I'm not gonna die from it like you might! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!	[]
Shelly	11	0	If I die from this, I'm taking you with me!	[]
TV Voice	8	0	Will Carol find out she's a fa...	[]
Stan	12	0	I don't wanna watch this! I wanna watch Terrance and Phillip!	[]
Shelly	4	0	We're watching this!	[]
Stan	8	1	Well I've got the remote, bitch! Hahaha.	['bitch']
Phillip	9	1	Say, Terrance? Will you check my ass for abnormalities?	['ass']
Terrance	11	0	Sure thing, Phillip.  Ah ha ha ha, you got me again!	[]
Phillip	3	0	That's tomfoolery.	[]
Shelly	4	0	Give me the remote!	[]
Stan	18	0	No way, dude! We're gonna watch Terrance and Phillip all day-- Ey! Get me out of here!	[]
TV Voice	2	0	She was...	[]
Dr. Doctor	18	0	He'll be okay, but it's a good idea for us to monitor him for a while.	[]
Sharon	6	0	Oh God, what have we done?	[]
Dr. Doctor	8	0	There there now, it's not your fault.	[]
Randy	22	0	Doctor, we-uuuh purposefully sent our son to stay with a friend who had chickenpox so that he would get it early.	[]
Dr. Doctor	8	0	Oh, wow, you did? Wow. You guys suck.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Could we go home now, Ma?	[]
Sheila	8	0	No, bubbeleh. You play with Kenny some more.	[]
Kyle	17	0	But we've been playing for eight hours. We can't think of anything else to do.	[]
Sheila	13	0	I've got a great game for you. It's called ookie mouth.	[]
Kyle	4	0	What's ookie mouth?	[]
Sheila	23	0	First, you let Kenny spit in your mouth. Then you try to swallow his spit and say ookie mouth at the same time.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Sick, dude!	[]
Sheila	17	0	No, no, bubbe, it's loads of fun. Try it.  That ought to take care of it.	[]
Mrs. McCormick	6	0	You want some more hot water?	[]
Sheila	28	0	Oh, no thank you. It's terrific though, it's-- You don't have any tea bags or coffee grounds to go in the hot water, do you?	[]
Mrs. McCormick	12	0	Naw, we don't go for that hoidy-toidy rich folk stuff.	[]
Sheila	11	0	I see. Well, you certainly have aab- humble home, Mrs. McCormick.	[]
Mrs. McCormick	12	1	Yehah, well, unfortunately my husband is a washed-up hunk of shit!	['shit']
Sheila	7	0	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.	[]
Kyle	9	0	Ookie mouth!  Gross! I can't do it, Ma!	[]
Sheila	3	0	Try again, bubbe!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Argh!	[]
Sheila	12	0	You know, your husband and mine used to work together as teenagers.	[]
Mrs. McCormick	10	0	Oh they wuz best friends; you couldn't separate 'em.	[]
Sheila	15	0	Really? I met Gerald in college, so I didn't know. What happened to them?	[]
Mrs. McCormick	30	0	Oh they jus' grew apart, I guess. I think Stuart's a little jealous that your husband got out of makin' pizzas and went on to make somethin' of hisself.	[]
Sheila	14	0	Well that's too bad. I'm sure your husband's a fine man.	[]
Mrs. McCormick	10	2	Oh, hell no! He's a nugget o' deer turd.	['hell', 'turd']
Sheila	22	0	But if they were such good friends it seems silly that they don't even talk anymore. Let's get them together!	[]
Mrs. McCormick	5	0	Uh-I don't know.	[]
Sheila	12	0	We'll just arrange a little fishing trip for them or something.	[]
Kyle	20	0	I can't say ookie mouth and have Kenny spit down my throat at the same time. It's impossible.	[]
Sheila	4	0	Practice makes perfect, bubbe.	[]
Cartman	6	1	Dammit, where's that calamine lotion?!	['dammit']
Terrance	9	0	Phillip, I've got good news, and bad news.	[]
Phillip	6	0	Give it to me straight, Terrance.	[]
Terrance	11	0	The good news is, you have a clean bill of health.	[]
Phillip	4	0	Oh, what a relief!	[]
Terrance	7	0	The bad news is, you have cancer.	[]
Phillip	1	0	Cancer?	[]
Terrance	8	1	Yes. I'm afraid your ass is collapsing.	['ass']
Phillip	4	1	My ass is collapsing?	['ass']
Terrance	21	3	Yes. See this X-ray?  That's your ass. See this line?  That's your ass collapsing. Your ass is collapsing.	['ass', 'ass', 'ass']
Phillip	12	1	Will this mean that I won't be able to fart anymore?	['fart']
Terrance	12	0	No, it means that you won't be able to live anymore.	[]
Cartman	17	1	Oh, no.  Damnit!  No, Kitty! That's a-- Wait a minute. Come 'ere, Kitty!  Uh. Yes. Uh...	['damnit']
Liane	10	0	I'm back, hon. I got some more calamine lotion.	[]
Cartman	8	0	It's about friggin' time! Give me that!	[]
Liane	15	0	Just use a little bit of that stuff, hon. It has to last a while.	[]
Cartman	11	1	Uugh!  Yeessss.  Ooohhh yyou guys, seriiously, it calms yer ass. Ahhhh...	['ass']
Stuart	9	0	I didn't know you like to fish, Gerry.	[]
Gerald	35	0	Oh, yeah, love it! I haven't done it for a while, though. I had to go out and buy a few things, you know a-. A rod and a reel and an uh, uuh...	[]
Stuart	2	0	Tackle box?	[]
Gerald	19	0	Yeah, tackle box.  Man, smell that mountain air. What a great Saturday morning; aren't weekends just the best?	[]
Stuart	8	0	When you're uh-unemployed, weekends are meaningless.	[]
Gerald	3	0	Right. Right-right.	[]
Mr. Garrison	20	0	And so, children, that's how you tell a prostitute from a policeman. Now, are there any questions?  Yes, Kyle?	[]
Kyle	11	1	What the hell does that have to do with American history?	['hell']
Mr. Garrison	12	0	Uh, that's a good question, Kyle. Are there any other questions?	[]
Kyle	13	0	Mr. Garrison, I'm the only one here. Everyone else has chicken herpes.	[]
Mr. Garrison	27	0	Right, right. Uhh... Well, class, I'm going to assign you all a paper. The theme of the paper will be, How I would make America better.	[]
Kyle	10	0	What?! Does everybody have to do it, or just me?	[]
Mr. Garrison	26	0	Uh, don't worry, Kyle. I'm sending homework to all the children who are out sick. They'll have to turn in a paper, too.	[]
Stan	7	0	Homework?! But I'm in the hospital!	[]
Sharon	15	0	Well, your teacher sent this stuff over for you to do while you're sick.	[]
Stan	12	1	That son of a bitch! What kind of sick weirdo is he?	['bitch']
Sharon	26	0	Now, Stanley, I know at your age teachers can seem cold and heartless, but later, you'll understand that he did this for your own good.	[]
Stan	10	0	Not Mr. Garrison, Ma. He really is a sick weirdo.	[]
Randy	8	0	Yeah, it's-it's true, he is.	[]
Sharon	10	0	Oh. Well, anyway, here's a pencil and some paper.	[]
Stan	5	0	Wait! Where are you going?	[]
Randy	11	0	We're going down to-uhh Happy Burger for some milkshakes.	[]
Stan	1	0	Milkshakes?!	[]
Sharon	9	0	Yeah, and then we're going to the movies.	[]
Randy	3	0	See ya, son.	[]
Stan	1	0	Weak!	[]
Kyle	28	0	So this is how America works. We have gods and clods. My dad says America needs both rich and poor to survive, but I have a better idea.	[]
Sheila	32	0	No I don't understand it, Dr. Schwartz, he's perfectly healthy.  He's been over at Kenny's house three days in a row and still hasn't caught the chickenpox.	[]
Kyle	1	0	What?	[]
Sheila	30	0	I don't know what else to do. We sent the other boys over and they all got sick, but I can't get my little Kyle to catch it.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Oh my God!	[]
Sheila	7	0	Kyle, what are you doing there, honey?	[]
Kyle	1	0	You!	[]
Sheila	7	0	I'll call you back, Dr. Schwartz.	[]
Kyle	1	0	You!	[]
Sheila	5	0	What, bubbeleh, what is it?	[]
Kyle	16	0	You sent us over to Kenny's house on purpose! You wanted us to get sick!	[]
Sheila	18	0	Oy. It was for your own good, Kyle. I wanted you to get chickenpox while you were young.	[]
Kyle	14	0	Why?! So I could be sitting in the hospital waiting to die, like Stan?!	[]
Sheila	4	0	Now, Kyle, come here.	[]
Kyle	8	0	You get away from me, you crazy woman!	[]
Sheila	2	0	Hoh boy.	[]
Stuart	1	0	Beer?	[]
Gerald	34	0	Huh? Oh, uh, no thanks, I brought my own. Microbrew sampler from Aspen. Has six different beers from local breweries.  Sahay, remember that time we built the fort in your mom's back yard?	[]
Stuart	16	1	Hu hu hu hu heh yeah. It took us damn near two years to finish it.	['damn']
Gerald	10	0	Hahah. Whatever happened to that old hunk o' junk? Haha--	[]
Stuart	6	0	That's where I live now.	[]
Gerald	2	0	Oh, right.	[]
Stan	13	0	And so that's why Knight Rider was the best show in America.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Stan! Stan!	[]
Stan	9	0	Sshh. Wake her up and we're both dead.	[]
Kyle	23	0	Sorry, sorry. You know how after we spent the night at Kenny's house and-and you and Cartman got sick with chickenpox?	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Kyle	11	0	Dude! Our parents sent us over there to get us sick!	[]
Stan	5	0	What are you talking about?	[]
Kyle	19	0	They knew that staying at Kenny's house would get us sick, and they made us do it anyway.	[]
Stan	2	0	They did?	[]
Kyle	8	0	Yeah. And I think I figured out why.	[]
Stan	1	0	Why?	[]
Kyle	7	1	Because they're a bunch of assholes.	['assholes']
Stan	2	0	Of course!	[]
Kyle	25	0	Come on, dude. We've gotta get out of here. I don't know what they're planning next, but it can't be good!	[]
Cartman	41	0	I hope that one day America could be more like Endor, where the Ewoks live. Endor is very cool.  Mom, answer that! They have trees and Ewoks, and barbecues, which is why I like Endor more than America. It's cool.	[]
Kyle	18	0	Cartman, do you remember how we all spent the night at Kenny's a couple of days ago?	[]
Cartman	8	0	I remember frozen waffles with no side dishes.	[]
Stan	12	0	Cartman, our parents sent us over there to catch chickenpox from Kenny!	[]
Kyle	12	0	Yeah, dude. Your mom wanted you to have herpes on your face.	[]
Cartman	2	0	She what?!	[]
Stan	16	0	It's some kind of parental conspiracy. Our parents are trying to kill us or something.	[]
Cartman	14	2	That bitch! I'm gonna go downstairs and kick her square in the nuts!	['bitch', 'nuts']
Kyle	14	0	No-no-no-no. Come on, fatass, we're gonna get 'em all back.	[]
Gerald	14	0	Well, I'm sure you'll find another job soon. Something'll come along.	[]
Stuart	6	0	Not that easy. You were lucky.	[]
Gerald	7	0	Now, now-I, I wasn't lucky.	[]
Stuart	13	0	You had rich parents. You got to go to that expensive community college.	[]
Gerald	18	1	Hey! I worked my ass off to get to where I am today!  I wanted to be somebody!	['ass']
Stuart	18	1	I wanted to be somebody, too! I just wasn't born with a silver enema up my ass!	['ass']
Gerald	15	0	You're just jealous. You're a bitter old drunk, just like your father!  Ow!!	[]
Stuart	8	0	Now don't make me do that again!	[]
Gerald	6	1	Ow! You son of a bitch!	['bitch']
Stuart	1	0	Uh!	[]
Gerald	1	0	Ow!	[]
Stuart	1	0	Oh!	[]
Gerald	1	0	Ow!	[]
Stuart	1	0	Eeaagghh!	[]
Gerald	1	0	Huuuh!	[]
Randy	1	0	Doctor?	[]
Dr. Doctor	1	0	Yes?	[]
Randy	4	0	Wh-where's Stan?	[]
Dr. Doctor	1	0	Stan?	[]
Randy	3	0	Stan, our son?	[]
Dr. Doctor	5	0	Oh, yes. Where is Stan?	[]
Sharon	5	0	You mean Stanley's missing?	[]
Dr. Doctor	17	0	No, no. He's not missing. We just... can't seem to find him at this moment.	[]
Sharon	7	0	Oh my God! Our son ran away!	[]
Randy	8	0	Will he be okay out of the hospital?	[]
Dr. Doctor	23	0	Oh sure, sure. But we have to get him back soon. If he doesn't get his antibiotic shot today, he could die.	[]
Sharon	1	0	Die?	[]
Dr. Doctor	21	0	Yes, die. It won't be any easy death, either. The chickenpox will slowly move down his trachea into his lungs.	[]
Randy	7	0	Okay, well well, let's go look--	[]
Dr. Doctor	23	0	As he chokes for breath, the pox will move through his inner ear into his brain, making him think he's David Duchovny.	[]
Sharon	3	0	Oh God, no!	[]
Randy	11	0	I'm-I'm sure he couldn't have gone far.	[]
Dr. Doctor	18	0	Now moving on all fours and wheezing uncontrollably, his cellular structure will regress into a gelatinous mass of--	[]
Sheila	12	0	So how was it? Did you boys have a good time fishing?	[]
Gerald	8	1	That son of a bitch ripped my parka!	['bitch']
Sheila	2	0	Catch anything?	[]
Gerald	19	1	I just don't get it.  Why would he invite me fishing and then turn into a complete bastard?	['bastard']
Sheila	19	0	Well, darling, I have to tell you something. He didn't invite you. I set the whole thing up.	[]
Gerald	12	1	What? Now why the hell would you knowingly deceive me like that?	['hell']
Sheila	8	0	I thought it would be good for you.	[]
Gerald	17	0	Just like you deceived our son into going to Kenny's; and that didn't work either!	[]
