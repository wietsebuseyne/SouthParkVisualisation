Stan	9	0	Why do we even hang out with him, anyway?	[]
Kyle	8	0	Hello?? I've been saying this for years!	[]
Stan	19	0	Well it's not like we're nice to him. I mean, we rip on him all the time!	[]
Kyle	6	0	Yes, but he thrives on that.	[]
Stan	23	0	All right. Then let's just ignore him. From now on, let's not talk to him, let's not even acknowledge him.	[]
Kenny	2	1	(Fuck yeah!)	['fuck']

No. No, I can't be dead.  I can't be dead!!	['jews', 'titty']
Black Plumber	22	0	All right, ma'am. We've got your new toilet installed and we'll haul away the old one away for ya.	[]
Liane	16	0	Oh, you've been so helpful, I uh, just don't know how to thank you.	[]
Black Plumber	9	0	Hunh, I could think of a few ways, hunh.	[]
Liane	2	0	Ohoho, nhn.	[]
Cartman	2	0	No! No!!	[]
Fat Plumber	5	0	What happened? Did they say?	[]
Thin Plumber	15	0	Apparently there was so much chicken skin in the system it just ruptured the insides.	[]
Fat Plumber	4	0	Aww, that's tragic.	[]
Cartman	24	0	Oh my God, this can't be happening!  Mom? Mom's crying? Oh God, it is true!  Oh, it's not fair!  Why??? Why???	[]
Jimmy	6	0	Hey fellas, w-where is Cartman?	[]
Stan	6	0	Cartman isn't our friend anymore.	[]
Kyle	4	0	We're ignoring him.	[]
Token	4	0	Ignoring him? How come?	[]
Kyle	11	1	Beause he's a fat racist self-centered intolerant manipulating sociopath!	['fat']
Token	2	0	Oh yeah.	[]

Can't you feel your hair move?! That's me!  They don't even know yet, that one of their best friends is dead.  Dead and... still wandering the earth a lost soul.	[]
Woman	5	0	What is that kid doing?	[]
Man	8	0	Ah I don't know, just ignore him.	[]
Butters	16	0	Lu lu lu, I've got some apples. Lu lu lu, you've got some too-	[]
Cartman	25	0	What did I do to deserve this?!  How can my own God forsake me?! Am I doomed to wander the Earth alone for all eternity?!	[]
Butters	2	0	Hey Eric!	[]
Cartman	4	0	...What did you say?	[]
Butters	6	0	Huh I just said, Hey Eric!	[]
Cartman	6	0	Butters...  Butters! You can see me??	[]
Butters	6	0	Well, sure I can see you.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Oh my God, and you can hear me??	[]
Butters	12	0	Well, jeez Eric, why wouldn't I be able to hear you?	[]
Cartman	5	0	Because, Butters, I'm... dead.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Butters! Butters, I just want to talk to you!	[]
Butters	3	0	You died?? How??	[]
Cartman	13	0	I ate a bunch of chicken skin and it blew out my insides.	[]
Butters	12	0	But if you're d-dead, how come I can see you?	[]
Cartman	12	0	I don't know, but you're the only one who can.	[]
Butters	1	0	HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!	[]
Cartman	7	1	Butters!  Butters, Goddamnit, I need your help!	['goddamnit']
Linda	7	0	Butters, what on earth are you doing??	[]
Butters	17	0	Well I think... I'm like the kid in that movie! I-I'm seeing dead people!	[]
Linda	2	0	Dead people?	[]
Stephen	5	0	Who's seeing dead people?	[]
Butters	5	0	Me! I saw a ghost!	[]
Stephen	9	0	Now, Butters, there's no such thing as ghosts.	[]
Butters	14	0	But I saw him! Just as plain as I'm seein' you right now!	[]
Stephen	24	0	Butters, these things happen all the time. You've got a very active little brain and your mind was just playing tricks on you.	[]
Butters	2	0	Ruh, really?	[]
Stephen	1	0	Yeess.	[]
Butters	12	0	So... so it was just... it was... just my ima... magination then?	[]
Stephen	29	0	That's right. There's no reason to be afraid of things that aren't real. There's plenty of real things to be scared of. Like super-AIDS.	[]
Butters	5	0	Huh s-s-super-AIDS?	[]
Stephen	29	2	That's right. A new form of AIDS which is resistant to drugs. Just one teaspoon of super-AIDS in your butt and you're dead in three years.	['drugs', 'butt']
Butters	3	0	AAAH!  Oh Jesus.	[]
Stephen	21	0	So now you feel better? Ghosts don't exist and there's nothing to be afraid of. Except the super-AIDS.	[]
Butters	21	0	Nuh-nothing to be scared of. Jus, just some lightning and thunder.  Gah! Wasn't nothin' neither. J-just a mouse.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Butters...	[]
Butters	1	0	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!	[]
Cartman	6	0	Butters, you have to help me!	[]
Butters	6	0	Go away! You aren't real!	[]
Cartman	8	0	All right, Butters, you leave me no choice.	[]
Butters	1	0	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!	[]
Stephen	5	0	Butters, what is going on?!	[]
Butters	13	0	Well I saw...  Well he was...  Nothin' I-I just had a nightmare.	[]
Stephen	14	0	Well you'd better stop having nightmares or eles you're gonna be grounded!	[]
Butters	4	0	Y yes, yes sir.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Butters.	[]
Butters	1	0	AH-	[]
Cartman	19	1	Butters, Goddamnit, I'm not in your imagination! I'm dead and for some reason you can see me!	['goddamnit']
Butters	8	0	But I don't want to see you!	[]
Cartman	30	0	Get a hold of yourself! I'm the one who died! And for some reason, my spirit is trapped here on Earth. I can't find the passage to Heaven.	[]
Butters	12	0	Well... how do you know you're supposed to go to Heaven?	[]
Cartman	4	0	What do you mean?	[]
Butters	15	0	Well... how do you know you're not supposed to go to... you know... Heck.	[]
Cartman	13	0	I'm not going to Heck, Butters! I'm not black, all right?!	[]
Butters	1	0	Oh.	[]
Cartman	33	0	Now look: I thnk the reason my soul is still here is because I need closure with all my friends and loved one. I can say my final goodbyes to them through you.	[]
Butters	8	0	I can't. Ahah I have school tomorrow.	[]
Cartman	20	0	This is your problem, Butters! Either you help me, or I will haunt you for the rest of your life!	[]
Butters	10	0	Helll- Uh all right. All right, I'll help you!	[]
Butters	2	0	Mrs. Cartman?	[]
Liane	3	0	Yes?  Oh hi.	[]
Butters	24	0	This is going to seem very strange and, and you may not believe me, but, well, your son wanted me to tell you something.	[]
Liane	4	0	Oh, what is it?	[]
Cartman	8	0	Tell her, tell her that I love her.	[]
Butters	5	0	He says, he love you.	[]
Liane	5	0	Oh, that's so nice.	[]
Cartman	17	0	Tell her, tell her that I wish... I wish I would have been a better son sometimes!	[]
Butters	10	0	He wishes he would have been a better son sometimes.	[]
Cartman	30	0	It's just that, it's just that I got so caught up with the rat race of life tryin' to succeed that I... sometimes... took my family for granted!	[]
Butters	18	0	He he got caught, he got caught up in the rat race of, of taking things for granted.	[]
Liane	11	0	Oh, that's so sweet. Oh, I love you too, poopiekins!	[]
Butters	44	1	Kyle, Eric wants you to know that he's, he's sorry for all the times he made fun of you being a no-good stinking Jew.  He's asking for your forgiveness. And and he wants you to just remember the good times.	['jew']
Cartman	4	0	Just the good times.	[]
Kyle	17	0	There were no good times! And if he really feels bad he can just tell me himself!	[]
Cartman	7	0	I can't! Don't you understand?!	[]
Butters	7	0	He can't! Don't you understand?!	[]
Cartman	11	1	God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive me!	['jews']
Butters	11	1	God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive him!	['jews']
Cartman	20	0	All right, come on, Butters, we gotta go tell Token I'm sorry for rippin' on him for bein' black.	[]
Butters	3	0	Uhh alright then.	[]
Stan	3	0	Who was that?	[]
Kyle	8	0	It was Cartman having Butters apologize for him.	[]
Stan	8	0	Dude, he did that to me this morning.	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Me too.)	[]
Kyle	21	0	He probably thinks if he apologizes to everyone, we'll think he's changed and let him back into our circle.	[]
Kenny	5	0	(That guy would try anything)	[]
Stan	8	0	Yeah, we know better than to think that.	[]
Cartman	33	0	Okay, that takes care of Token, Clyde, and Mr. Kitty. That's eveyone, I guess.  All that leaves is you, Butters. Butters, I'm sorry if I ever did anything to hurt you.	[]
Butters	5	0	Aww, that's okay, Eric.	[]
Cartman	16	0	Well, it's all done. My soul is at peace. I think... I can go now.	[]
Butters	7	0	So I won't see you again?	[]
Cartman	21	0	Don't be sad, Butters. What awaits each person in heaven is eternal bliss, divine rest, and ten thousand dollars cash.	[]
Butters	1	0	Wow.	[]
Cartman	19	0	G'bye Butters. I'm goin' to a better place. Perhaps I'll see you again sometime! Good-bye!!	[]
Butters	5	0	Yeh you're still here.	[]
Cartman	7	2	Goddamnit, what the fuck is going on?	['goddamnit', 'fuck']
Butters	8	0	Well, I guess saying goodbye wasn't enough.	[]
Cartman	7	0	What else do I have to do?!	[]
Butters	25	0	Well, well, you know, the preacher says that before your soul can be at peace, sometimes, you have to atone for something bad you did.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Atone?	[]
Butters	7	0	Did you ever do anything really bad?	[]
Cartman	2	0	Not really...	[]
Cartman	17	0	Let's see. Oh, and I broke Mr. Anderson's fence and never told him about it.	[]
Butters	2	0	Broke fence...	[]
Cartman	78	3	I took a crap in the principal's purse... seven times. Then there was the time I convinced a woman to have an abortion so I could build my own Shakey's Pizza. I pretended to be retarded and joined the Special Olympics. I tried to have all the Jew exterminated last spring. Uhh, oh yeah, and there's this one kid whose parents I had killed and then made into chili which I fed to the kid.	['crap', 'retarded', 'jew']
Butters	12	0	Boy oh boy, Eric, you've got a lot to atone for.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Really?	[]
Butters	17	0	Really. I mean, honestly, I don't know how you're gonna make up for all this.	[]
Cartman	3	0	I know how.	[]
Eric Cartman	121	0	I'm gonna make, make it right. I'm gonna take a little time and set things right. Make, make it right. I'm payin' for my sins and it sure feels great. It feels so good to be making up For all the things I've done wrong. I know now what the Good Lord in Heaven Wanted from me all along. All along, I'm gonna make, make it right. 'Cause Jesus wants me to have a clean slate. Not faking it, I'm making it right. I'm payin' for my sins and it sure feels great. Make, make it right! Make, make it right! Gonna make it right, girl, I've got to have your lovin' tonight!	[]
Cartman	10	0	Well, there's everything, Butters.  I've made everything right.	[]
Butters	8	0	Does this mean... you have to go now?	[]
Cartman	35	1	Yes, Butters, my soul is finally at peace. It's time for me to leave.  Goodbye Butters! Thanks for all your help! Be good and be safe. Goodbye...  Goddamnit, what?! I've made everything right!	['goddamnit']
Butters	15	0	Oh jeez. I I guess maybe your soul is stuck here for a different reason.	[]
Cartman	18	0	I want my eternal bliss! Do you think this is funny, God?!  Do you think this is funny,..?	[]
Butters	6	1	Eric! Calm down.  Stupid butthole God!	['butthole']
Stephen	5	0	Butters! What have you done?!	[]
Butters	11	0	Ih ih it wasn't me! Ih it was the ghost!	[]
Linda	15	0	Oh, Stephen, I don't know if we should ground him or call a doctor.	[]
Stephen	13	0	No, I think you'd better call a doctor. I'll ground him.	[]
Linda	5	0	What do you think, Doctor?	[]
Doctor	54	0	Your son is suffering from severe dementia. He claims that the ghost of a dead friend talks to him. This is usually a sign of schizophrenia brought on by some tragic event in the child's past. I think it's best that we take him to the mental center and do some tests.	[]
Linda	3	0	Oh no.  NO!	[]
Doctor	17	0	All right, Butters, just try to relax.  Doin' just fine, Butters.  Just stay perfectly still now, Butters.	[]
Butters	6	0	Lu lu lu, lu lu lu	[]
Doctor	26	0	Good. You're gonna feel a little pinch now, Butters.  Don't worry, Mr. Stotch. Whatever traumatized your son in his past, we'll find it.	[]
Doctor	39	0	Well, after fourteen hours of testing, I can say Butters is definitely suffering from aggravated repressed memory syndrome. You see, Butters, when the brain wants to cover something up, it makes up images and sounds for you to hear.	[]
Butters	10	0	So... the ghost was in my head. The whole time.	[]
Stephen	6	0	Now do you believe us, Butters?	[]
Butters	7	0	Yes! Uh yes sir! I believe you.	[]
Doctor	25	0	Good. We're making a lot of headway. We'll do some more testing tomorrow. All right, folks. Let's let Butters get some rest.	[]
Linda	2	0	Goodnight, baby.	[]
Butters	1	0	Ahhh.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Butters.	[]
Butters	1	0	AAAAAAAAAAAAAH!	[]
Cartman	12	0	Don't worry, Butters, I'm gonna get you out of here.	[]
Butters	10	0	Please leave me alone, Eric. My bottom is really sore.	[]
Cartman	25	0	I found the woman you need to talk to for me. Look!  Doctor Lindsay, expert in the paranormal. She can tell us what to do!	[]
Butters	16	0	Eric, ye-you're just an image in my head brought on by a traumatic event.	[]
Cartman	7	0	She's gonna close soon! Come on!	[]
Butters	7	0	Wuh I hate my stupid psychotic brain!	[]
Butters	8	0	Hello, ma'am. May I talk to you?	[]
Psychic	14	0	Certainly. Come in.  Have a seat and tell me what it is you seek.	[]
Butters	53	0	Well, there's this ghost, see? Only it probably isn't a ghost, ih-it's just a delusion brought on by my trauma. Well I'm supposed to heh, help him, find out why his spirit is wanderin' the Earth, even though I know that I'm most likely just completely insane.	[]
Psychic	31	0	Well, many times, the reason that the soul stays Earth-bound is because God is intending to use that soul for a divine purpose, to help prevent an impending tragic event.	[]
Butters	13	0	Of course. That's it, Butters! We had it wrong all the time!	[]
Psychic	17	0	But now, you shouldn't think you're crazy, young man. I see ghosts all the time.	[]
Butters	1	0	Really?	[]
Psychic	9	0	Yes. When's the last time you saw yours?	[]
Butters	9	0	Well, he's sittin' next to me right now.	[]
Psychic	1	0	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!	[]
Butters	13	0	Hey, I think she could see you too. You really are a ghost.	[]
Cartman	4	0	I told you, Butters.	[]
Announcer	4	0	This is breaking news!	[]
Anchor Tom	25	0	A tragic event is unfolding in South Park. Three convicted murderers have escaped from jail and are holding twelve people hostage at the Red Cross!	[]
Reporter Chris	38	0	Tom, the convicts were about to be arrested when they ran inside the Red Cross behind me, and threatened to kill all the workers inside. The violent men are demanding a helicopter and two hundred thousand dollars cash.	[]
Cartman	31	0	Oh my God, this is it, Butters. This is what I'm here to stop. Come on, Butters. This psychic boy and his ghost pal are going to save the day!	[]
Officer	3	0	Stay back, people!	[]
Man	10	1	Stay back?! Hell, my wife and child are in there!	['hell']
Det. Yates	11	0	Stay calm in there. We don't want anybody getting hurt.	[]
Lead Convict	16	0	You get us a helicopter and two hundred thousand dollars or these people start dyin', man!	[]
Cartman	24	0	All right, Butters, I'm going in alone, first. Give me thirty seconds in there, and then you go in and free the hostages.	[]
Butters	9	0	Go in there? Uh, but they'll see me.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Don't worry. I have a plan.	[]
Butters	6	0	Eric.  Well, be careful, ghost pal.	[]
Cartman	10	0	They can't hurt me, Butters. I'm already dead.	[]
Det. Yates	7	1	What the hell is that kid doing?	['hell']
Bald Convict	4	0	Somebody's comin' in!	[]
Convict 2	7	1	It's just some little fat kid.	['fat']
Bald Convict	6	1	What the hell is going on?	['hell']
Convict 2	4	0	I have no idea.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Yes, it's working!	[]
Lead Convict	4	0	This is really weird.	[]
Reporter Chris	15	0	An incredible development here, Tom. Two little boys have fearlessly gone inside the Red Cross.	[]
Stan	1	0	Cartman?	[]
Bald Convict	4	0	I'm so confused!	[]
Butters	3	0	Hurry. Go, go!	[]
Officer 2	4	0	The hostages are clear!	[]
Det. Yates	4	0	All right, move in!	[]
Convict 2	4	0	The hostages are gone!	[]
Bald Convict	5	1	What?!  Son of a bitch.	['bitch']
Reporter Chris	43	0	Tom, an incredible story of courage. Two little boys, armed only with the weapon of confusion, managed to go in and save the Red Cross. Nobody seems to know who the boys are or where they went off to, but they are heroes.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Well, we did it, Butters. We saved the day.	[]
Butters	4	0	Boy, we sure did.	[]
Cartman	33	0	My spirit is at rest now. I can finally go to everlasting peace, eternal rest, and ten thousand dollars cash. Butters, I think that, through this whole thing, we've really become friends.	[]
Butters	7	0	Yeah. Uh I feel that way too.	[]
Cartman	14	0	We both, kind of needed each other and... well... I'm gonna miss you.	[]
Butters	7	0	I'll miss you too, ghost pal.	[]
Cartman	25	0	Goodbye Butters. I must be going now. I'll be looking down on you from time to time. Have a long, fulfilling life, Butters! Goodbye!	[]
Stan	9	0	Hey Cartman, that was really cool what you did.	[]
Clyde	9	0	Yeah Eric, we're gonna stop ignoring you now.	[]
Kyle	19	0	We didn't think that by pretending you didn't exist, you would really change, but you really have.	[]
Stan	12	0	Well, anyway, we just wanna let you know. Talk to you tomorrow.	[]
Jimmy	5	0	Yeah. S-see ya, Eric.	[]
Cartman	3	1	You sonofabitch Butters!	['sonofabitch']
Butters	1	0	Huh?	[]
Cartman	7	0	You told me I was a ghost!	[]
Butters	7	0	Huh but I thought you were one!	[]
Cartman	24	0	How stupid are you?! So help me GOD Butters, I'm gonna get you back for this! I'm going to  GET YOU BACK!	[]
Stephen	1	0	Butters?!	[]
Butters	2	1	Oh hamburgers.	['hamburgers']
