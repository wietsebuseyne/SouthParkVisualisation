Choir Boy	13	0	Did you know over 10,000 acres of rainforest are bulldozed every year?	[]
Choir Girl	16	0	That's right. And over 30% of the world's oxygen  is made in the rainforest.	[]
Choir Teacher	7	0	So, who wants to join the fun??	[]
Cartman	8	0	What if you don't have any rhythm?	[]
Choir Teacher	2	0	Excuse me?	[]
Cartman	15	1	Well, like my friend Kyle. He's Jewish, so he doesn't have any rhythm.	['jewish']
Kyle	3	0	Shut up, fatass!	[]

Eric	11	1	Ey, don't flip me off, you son of a bitch!	['bitch']
Mr. Mackey	30	0	Sit down, boys. Now, let's see. What did Mr. Garrison send you in here for? The boys were being rude while a choir teacher was giving some stupid presentation-	[]
Stan	9	0	It's just some dumb activist kids' choir thing.	[]
Mr. Mackey	24	1	Uh, young man, Getting Gay With Kids is not dumb, m'kay? It just so happens that I'm on the board of directors.	['gay']
Kyle	17	0	Dude! All those choirs are the same. They don't even really sing. They use prerecorded tapes.	[]
Mr. Mackey	25	1	Well, guess what, boys? I think that Getting Gay With Kids is just what you need. I'm gonna sign up all four of you.	['gay']
Stan	1	0	What?!	[]
Kyle	5	0	You can't do that!	[]
Kenny	4	0	(Woohoo!)  (I mean, 'Oh.')	[]
Mr. Mackey	9	0	I think this will be very good for you	[]
Stan	9	0	But we don't even care about the rainforest.	[]
Mr. Mackey	9	0	And that's exactly why you need to go!	[]
Cartman	20	0	Please, Mr. Mackey, we'll be good. Don't send us to that ole kids' choir. Have mercy, Mr. Mackey.	[]
Sheila	10	0	Be safe, Kyle. Bring me something back from the rainforest.	[]
Choir Teacher	16	0	Oh, nonono. The rainforest is very fragile. We must take only pictures and leave only footprints.	[]
Sheila	5	0	Oh, I didn't realize.	[]
Choir Boy	17	0	Did you know that right now, bulldozers are tearing down thousands of acres of rainforest every day?	[]
Cartman	8	1	Aw, man, this is gonna suck donkey balls.	['balls']
Stan	12	0	Please don't make me go on a choir tour, Mom, please!	[]
Sharon	21	0	Stan, you should be excited. I would love to see the rainforest. Besides, your dad and I need some time alone.	[]
Stan	2	1	Nooo-ho!	['ho']
Choir Teacher	26	0	Okay, children, that's all of us. We're ready to head for the Latin American nation of Costa Rica, a country filled with virgin rainforest.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Whoopee.	[]
Choir Teacher	19	0	And you must be Eric Cartman. I've heard about you. You don't respect nature or other cultures.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Yeah, pretty much.	[]
Choir Teacher	10	0	Well, I'm gonna change the way you think, kiddo.	[]

Cartman	3	0	The nightmare begins.	[]
Choir Teacher	22	0	Oh, look, children! I think we're entering San Jose, which is the capital of Costa Rica.  Oh! This is so exciting!	[]
Cartman	12	1	Oh my God! Dude, look at how dirty and crappy everything is!	['crappy']
Choir Teacher	19	0	Eric, Costa Rica is a Third-World country. These people are much poorer than those in the U.S.	[]
Cartman	30	1	Well, why the hell don't they get jobs?!  Ey! Why don't you people quit slacking off, and get a job! What's wrong with you?! Go to college!	['hell']
Choir Teacher	3	0	Eric, sit down!	[]
Cartman	39	0	Look, you've gotta be firm with these people or they just slack off and be poor forever. Right, Kenny?  Hey, maybe that's it, Kenny. Maybe you're Costa Rican; that's why your family's so poor.	[]
Kenny	6	0	(Argh! That's just so untrue.)	[]
Kelly	5	0	Your family isn't poor?	[]
Cartman	16	0	Whoa, dude, look over there!  Wow! Costa Rican prostitutes! Hey, look at the prostitutes, you guys!	[]

Cartman	9	1	Oh my God,  it smells like ass out here.	['ass']
Choir Teacher	13	0	All right, that does it!  Eric Cartman, you respect other cultures this instant!	[]
Cartman	17	1	I wasn't saying anything about their culture, I was just saying their city smells like ass.	['ass']
Kelly	14	0	Wow, seeing a place like this really makes you appreciate living in America, huh?	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Uh-huh.)	[]
Choir Teacher	15	0	You may think that making fun of Third-World countries is funny, but let me-	[]
Cartman	20	0	I don't think it's funny! This place is overcrowded, smelly, and poor! That's not funny, that sucks!	[]
Choir Teacher	19	0	Eric, will you please, please, just keep your mouth shut while we present ourselves to the Costa Rican President?	[]
Cartman	1	0	Why?	[]
Choir Teacher	12	0	Because I'll buy you some ice cream afterwards if you do.	[]

Cartman	9	1	I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm!	['jewish']
Kyle	3	1	Fuck off, Cartman!	['fuck']
Stan	9	0	No, dude! I think Cartman might actually be right.	[]
Kyle	5	0	No! That's a stereotype.	[]
Stan	9	0	Dude! Maybe you really don't have any rhythm.	[]
Pablo	13	0	This is now secondary rainforest we are entering. Notice the canopy of foliage.	[]

Cartman	3	0	Bad! Bad monkey!	[]
Choir Teacher	7	0	Eric, what the heck are you doing??	[]
Cartman	32	0	I'm asserting myself. It's tough love. Just like my Mr. Kitty. When he's bad I say, Uh that a bad Mr. Kitty! and I smack him on the head!	[]
Pablo	7	0	And here is a three-toed sloth.	[]

Kids	1	0	YEAH!	[]
Choir Boy	8	0	I wish we could have seen the Yanogapa.	[]
Kyle	4	0	What's the Yanogapa?	[]
Choir Teacher	36	0	The Yanogapa are gentle native people that live in the rainforest, but bulldozers are destroying their homes. Soon, they will have nowhere to go. So we must stop bulldozing the rainforest so that they can live-!	[]
Cartman	6	0	Aagh Ghyod, here she goes again!!	[]
Stan	1	0	AAAAAAA!	[]
Choir Teacher	4	0	Stanley, what is it?	[]
Stan	1	0	SNAAAKE!	[]
Pablo	19	0	Oh, yes. Uh this is what we call a coral snake. Notice the red markings. Quite an amazing creature.	[]
Stan	1	0	AAAAAAA!	[]
Pablo	6	0	What's the matter, little boy?	[]
Cartman	10	0	He's a little wuss, what's it look like?	[]
Stan	7	0	I'm just a-scared of snakes.	[]
Pablo	19	0	Naw, naw. You must remember. This snake is more afraid of us than we are of it.  Oh!!  Agh.	[]
Choir Teacher	3	0	Oh my God!!	[]
Cartman	10	0	Yeah, that snake is really scared of us all right!	[]
Choir Teacher	5	0	Jesus Christ, is he dead?!	[]
Stan	1	0	Dude!	[]
Kyle	5	0	My guess would be 'yes.'	[]
Choir Teacher	9	0	Oh, no! God, no, no!  Don't panic, children.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Bad! That's a bad snay-ah!	[]
Choir Teacher	13	0	Maybe we came from that way.  No, nno. Let's try this way.	[]
Kelly	9	0	Benny? Do you think we're gonna be okay?	[]
Kenny	4	0	(Yeah. Everything is fine.)	[]
Kelly	8	0	That's good. Can I tell you something?	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Okay.)	[]
Kelly	5	0	I think I like you.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Really?!)	[]
Kelly	9	0	Yeah. I mean, I think we communicate really well.	[]
Kenny	4	0	(Oh, that's great!)	[]
Kelly	5	0	No, that's not good.	[]
Kenny	4	0	(That's not good?)	[]
Kelly	60	0	No. See, if I start to like you too much,  I'm only going to get my heart broken. 'Cause we live on opposite ends of the country.  Once this choir tour is over, we'll never see each other again.  And that would devastate me.  So I can't have any feelings for you, I just can't, Lenny!	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Aaaargh!)	[]
Choir Teacher	16	0	Oh, children, the sun is setting. We have to find our way out of here quick!	[]
Choir Teacher	21	0	Whoa-kay, okay, everything is just fine, kids. Now it is important that we all stick together. Is everybody still here?	[]
A Boy	3	0	I'm not.	[]
Choir Teacher	3	0	Who's not?!	[]
A Boy	1	0	Me.	[]
Kelly	15	0	Benny, will you hold my hand?  I don't want to get emotionally attached, though.	[]
Stan	9	0	Oh my God, dude!! I just saw Tony Danza!!	[]
Choir Teacher	9	0	No, you didn't just see Tony Danza, Stanley.	[]
El Presidente	22	0	Bueno, bueno. Pongan el arcoiris al lado de las tortugas muertas. (Put the rainbow next to the picture of dying sea turtles.)	[]
Mr. Mackey	8	0	Buenos dias, Senor Presidente, mbien? (Hello, El Presidente)	[]
El Presidente	11	0	Que tal? Esta todo bien? (Oh hello. Is everything going okay?)	[]
Mr. Mackey	28	0	Uh, muy bien. Senor Presidente, um... Usted no ha visto el coro, no, mm-hm bien? (Oh fine, fine... You, uh, haven't seen the choir have you?)	[]
El Presidente	2	0	Que?! (What?!)	[]
Mr. Mackey	18	0	Parece que anoche no regresaron al hotel, hmbien. (Well, they never came back to the hotel last night...)	[]
El Presidente	58	0	Esta bromeando, Mackey?! Mas de cien mil personas atenderan este evento!!! Y me dice usted que no tendre a mis chiquitos lindos para que les canten?! (You've got to be kidding!! I have over a hundred thousand people coming to this event!!! Are you telling me that I have no darling little kids to sing to them?!)	[]
Mr. Mackey	29	0	Estoy seguro que-uh-mmm, que-aaah llega- llegaran. No se preocupe. Eh, olvidelo, yeah-mbien? (I am sure they'll get here. No problem, forget I said anything.)	[]
Kyle	11	0	Dude, we're totally lost! We're gonna die out here!	[]
Kelly	2	0	We are?	[]
Choir Teacher	37	0	Don't worry, Kelly. We're gonna find our way out of the rainforest and make it back to the concert in time. We just need to respect our mother rainforest so that she will respect us.	[]
Kyle	9	0	Miss Stevens, you have a bug on your back.	[]
Miss Stevens	7	0	Oh, really? Could you brush it off?	[]
Kyle	2	0	Um, no.	[]
Miss Stevens	44	0	Oh, boy oh!! Oh my God, get it off me!! For the love of God, get it off me!! Oh my God!!  Oh-okay, children. We must understand that the insects of the rainforest help the delicate balance of life here.  Oh my God!!	[]
Kyle	6	0	Rainforests suck! I wanna go home!	[]
Kelly	2	0	Me, too!	[]
Miss Stevens	28	0	Shh. Children, okay, let's try to listen to what the rainforest tells us. And if we use our ears she can tell us so many things. Perhaps-	[]
Kyle	6	0	Aaaaa! There's a dude here!	[]
Miss Stevens	14	0	Oh, thank goodness! Hello, sir. We are lost.  Cah heh, can you help us?	[]
Soldier	1	0	Que?	[]
Cartman	23	0	Let me try, let me try. We are from America. A-me-ri-ca.  We are lost and verry hungry. Necesito burri-tos.	[]
Stan	10	0	I don't wanna burrito, I want a taco. Supreme.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Y taco.	[]
Kyle	7	0	I want two tostadas and mild sauce.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Two tostadas and mih-um enchilito.	[]
Miss Stevens	30	0	Boys, please. Not every Spanish person eats tacos and burritos. That's a stereotype.  Children, he wants us to follow him! Oooh, thank goodness! I think this ordeal is over!	[]
Stan	6	0	This doesn't look very safe.	[]
Kyle	11	1	Yeah. I think we should get the hell out of here.	['hell']
Miss Stevens	40	0	Now kids, let's be a bit more open-minded. I read all about this in Newsweek; this is a people's army. They are fighting the fascist policies of their fascist government.  Oh, hello. Do you speak of English?	[]
People's Army Leader	3	0	Who are you?!	[]
Miss Stevens	68	0	Oh, wonderful! We were lost, and it is such a great coincidence we found you. You see, we're here to protest the government-sanctioned raping of your rainforest.  We are fighters, just like you. Could you help us get back to San Jose?  Um...  Oh, I know! Perhaps you would like a gift.. Well, we have o-honly-hee one gift to give. The gift... of song	[]
Kids	1	0	Honh.	[]
Miss Stevens	13	0	Kyle, for the love of God, do the right choreography.  Oh, Kyle, please!	[]
People's Army Leader	1	0	Enough!	[]
Miss Stevens	12	0	Well, we hope that our gift of song has warmed your hearts.	[]
People's Army Leader	9	1	We're not getting gay with any kids, okay?	['gay']
Miss Stevens	11	0	Uh, yah, soooo, do you have a phone we could use?	[]
People's Army Leader	26	0	Heehee yes, we have a phone. It's right over there next to the 12-person jacuzzi.  Now, get out of here before we kill you!	[]
Miss Stevens	10	1	Is it because of the little Jewish boy's choreography?	['jewish']
Kyle	1	0	Hey!	[]
People's Army Leader	37	0	You white Americans make me sick!  You waste food, oil, and everything else because you're so rich, and then you tell the rest of the world to save the rainforest because you like its pretty flowers.	[]
People's Army Leader	2	0	Rapido, rapido!	[]
Miss Stevens	3	0	Run, children, run!	[]
El Presidente	22	1	Donde putos esta el coro?! El espectaculo comienza pronto! (Where the hell is our choir?! The show is supposed to start soon!)	['hell']
Mr. Mackey	44	0	No se preocupe, mbien? El Presidente, estaran aqui. Este evento es muy importante para que la maestra del coro se lo pierda. M-m-mbien? (Don't worry, El Presidente, they'll be here. This is too important for the choir teacher to miss.)	[]
Miss Stevens	3	0	Hello?? Anybody?? Help??	[]
Choir Boy	6	0	Wow, look at the pretty flower.	[]
Miss Stevens	10	0	Oh nonono, Jake. That fragile flower is very delicate, okay?	[]
Jake	3	0	Aaaah. Ugh, help!	[]
Miss Stevens	2	0	Ga-ow!	[]
Kelly	8	0	I wanna go home!  I hate the rainforest!	[]
Kenny	12	0	(Oh, there, there now. There's nothing to be afraid of, dear.)	[]
Kelly	16	0	Oh Lenny, hold me.  No, I can't get attached.  Oh, but I do like you.	[]
Kenny	4	0	(Well, I like you-)	[]
Kelly	9	0	Oh, but you're only going to leave me.	[]
Kenny	4	1	(Oh, God damn it!)	['damn']
Short Reporter	47	0	We're here live in San Jose, Costa Rica, where hundreds of rich Americans have gathered for the Save the Rain Forest summit. Everyone is here so they can feel good about themselves, and act like they aren't the ones responsible for the rainforest's peril.	[]
Slim Reporter	31	1	That's right, Bob, and of course the main attraction today is the darling kids' choir, Getting Gay With Kids, all of whom must be backstage preparing at this very moment.	['gay']
Miss Stevens	33	0	Oh, there's just no end to this place! I think maybe we're going in circles. Oh, dear God! The summit starts in an hour; I'm gonna lose my job!  Aaaah!	[]
Cartman	12	1	This is bullcrap! I am not following this stupid hippie around anymore.	['bullcrap']
Miss Stevens	5	0	Eric, where are you going?	[]
Cartman	5	0	I'm going this way!	[]
Miss Stevens	14	0	Young man, I am the adult here, and I say you go this way!	[]
Cartman	12	0	Look: you can stay over nyah , but I'm going over nyah.	[]
Miss Stevens	6	0	Young man, I have had it!!	[]
Cartman	12	0	Nononono! You nyah, me nyah!  Screw you guys, I'ma going home.	[]
Miss Stevens	14	1	Good! You deserve to die, you little bastard!  Eric, we have to stay together!	['bastard']
Cartman	32	2	God-damned stupid hippie activist! I should be home nestled in the couch with my Mr. Kitty right now watching Fat Abbot cartoons and eat-  Yes! I knew it! I'm saved!	['damned', 'fat']
Stan	5	0	Hey. Maybe Cartman was right.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Yeah. It happened once before.	[]
Miss Stevens	12	0	No. The Spirit of Maya has told me to go this way.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Mister! You've gotta help me! I'm starving to death!	[]
Foreman	7	0	What are you doing here, little boy?	[]
Cartman	22	0	I was with my class, and we got all lost in the rainforest, and I need some food. I'm fading fast!	[]
Foreman	12	0	Lost in the rainforest? Oh, my Lord! Where are all the others?	[]
Cartman	6	0	Food! I have to have food!	[]
Foreman	9	0	Oh my God! Get this child some food, quick!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Chicken wings.	[]
Foreman	2	0	Chicken wings!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Medium spicy.	[]
Crowd	9	0	Start the show! Start the show! Start the show!	[]
El Presidente	25	0	La gente esta ansiosa. Dentro de poco, se alborotan y empiezan a tirar chorchadas. (The activists are getting anxious. They will start throwing things soon.)	[]
Mr. Mackey	26	0	Estoy seguro que llegaran. Eh-solo poquito mas de tiempo, mbien? (I'm sure the choir will be here. We just need a little more time)	[]
El Presidente	20	0	Bueno, voy a entretenerlos con mis chistes de Polacos.  (Well, I will try and amuse them with my Polish Jokes.)	[]
Mr. Mackey	1	0	Mbien.	[]
El Presidente	40	0	A cuantos Polacos les toma a comerse un burrito?  Dos.  A cuantos Polacos les toma a manejar a Panama? (How many Pollacks does it take to eat a burrito? Two. How many Pollacks does it take to drive to Panama?)	[]
Miss Stevens	14	0	Oh God, this is a nightmare! We're never going to make the festival!	[]
Stan	8	0	Hey, look over there. Isn't that smoke?	[]
Miss Stevens	4	0	Let's go, quickly!	[]
Kyle	11	0	Hey, it's a fire. That means there must be people.	[]
Miss Stevens	18	0	Children, it's the Yanogapa.  Do not be afraid. We are not here to tear down your rainforest.	[]
Yanogapa 1	1	0	Damtilie?	[]
Yanogapa 2	1	0	Damtilie?	[]
Miss Stevens	17	0	Look how they live in peace with all living things. Gentle, noble...  Run for your lives, children!	[]

Stan	3	0	We're sinking.	[]
Miss Stevens	4	0	It's quicksand, people!	[]
Stan	14	0	All we ever heard growing up was, Save the rainforest. The rainforest is fragile!	[]
Kyle	4	1	Yeah! Fragile my ass!	['ass']
Kelly	26	0	Larry, if we make it out of this, I want to be your girlfriend. Even if we do live in different places, I don't care!	[]
Kenny	4	0	(Kelly, you said it!)	[]
