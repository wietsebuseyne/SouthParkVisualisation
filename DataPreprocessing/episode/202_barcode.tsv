Towelie	11	0	Jus', just let me walk on the sunshine a little more.	[]
Specialist 1	23	0	All right! In the surfing competition, the Red Team is up three points to two.  And now it's Jimmy Valmer's turn.	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmeh!	[]
Frances	11	0	Gee, I wish our team captain was as awesome as Jimmy.	[]
Nathan	19	0	I finally got it, Mimsy. I got a way we can get rid of Jimmy once and for all.	[]
Mimsy	12	0	Oh boy oh boy! What are we gonna do to him, boss?	[]

Mimsy	19	0	Dahhh okay boss, a shark-mating whistle. We're gonna hit him over the head with it, huh boss?'	[]
Nathan	22	0	No, you moron. You go under the water and blow that whistle. You can attract sharks right as Jimmy starts to surf.	[]
Mimsy	32	0	Dahhh I've got it boss. I blow the whistle and make the shark come and bite Jimmy's legs off.  Then he bleeds to death. He's gonna bleed to death.	[]
Steve	7	0	Are you boys enjoying the fun beach?	[]

Mimsy	29	0	Dahh whattaya mean, boss? You said to swim in the water and to blow the whistle. I swam in the water, so now I'm gonna blow the whistle.	[]
Nathan	23	1	You fucking idiot! You don't blow a shark mating whistle on dry land! You were supposed to blow it-  eh uh uh...	['fucking']

Butters	38	0	You're not the towel you used to be.  Where, as you used to be fluffy and absorbent, ye-you now are crusty and.... and unable to absorb the smallest amount of water. Will you get help today?	[]
Towelie	9	0	I I don't, I don't get this.	[]
Jeff VanVonderen	1	0	Kyle?	[]
Kyle	35	1	Towelie, over the past few months I have watched you go from an ancillary character with a few amusing catchphrases to a dried out spooge rag covered in the jizz of a thousand older men.	['jizz']
Towelie	6	0	Could we just end this please?	[]
Jeff VanVonderen	7	0	You have to let him finish, Towelie.	[]
Kyle	24	0	If you do not accept treatment I will no longer give you money or be your friend. I will not help you kill yourself.	[]
Jeff VanVonderen	7	0	Alright. Eric, do you wanna go next?	[]
Cartman	21	0	Kyle, I hate you so much. You are a liar and a swindler who would do anything for money, and I-.	[]
Kyle	6	0	We're here for Towelie, fatass!	[]
Cartman	36	1	I'm supposed to be allowed to finish, right? Is that right?  The Jews have been persecuted across the earth for good reason, Kyle. You are a race of beady-eyed thieves who are always wan-	['jews']
Kyle	6	2	This is serious, you fucking asshole!	['fucking', 'asshole']
Cartman	6	0	I'm being serious, Kyle! Hello?!	[]
Jeff VanVonderen	12	0	Kyle, we have to let people be allowed to finish during interventions.	[]
Kyle	12	0	But he's just using his time on television to rant about-	[]
Jeff VanVonderen	7	0	Kyle please, It is not your turn!	[]
Cartman	44	1	You are a race of beady-eyed thieves, Kyle, who throughout the millennia have squirmed and worked your way into the dark cubbyholes of society.  Where exactly did the Jews first get their power and how are they able to manipulate our minds today?	['jews']
Kyle	3	0	Oh my God!	[]

Nathan	10	0	Get ready, Mimsy. Blue Team is about to go boom.	[]

Mimsy	18	0	Dahh I don't think he's playing the right note, boss. The C4 aint gonna go off.	[]
Nathan	3	0	Shut up, Mimsssyyy!	[]
Cartman	45	1	If in fact the Jews truly are shapeshifters, and I believe I've presented enough evidence here to prove that they are, then we must unite as a species to fight them and stop their plan of global domination and the control of our freedom.	['jews']
Jeff VanVonderen	7	0	Okay, Stan, you want to go next?	[]
Stan	17	0	Towelie, if you do not go to treatment, we will all ignore you forever. Will you go?	[]

Jeff VanVonderen	12	0	Well Towelie, your friends don't wanna watch you kill yourself anymore.	[]
Towelie	21	1	Then fuck them! You're tellin' me I have to do this? Uh, I'm not left with any decisions here!	['fuck']
