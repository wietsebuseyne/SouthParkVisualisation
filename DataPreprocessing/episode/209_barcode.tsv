Randy	15	1	Stan, there's nothing wrong with a man following his passion!  Ooo yeah, fuck yeah.	['fuck']

Stan	11	0	Dad! You aren't ever going to be a celebrity chef!	[]
Randy	4	0	Quiet on set, please.	[]
Stan	14	0	No Dad, that's enough! You need to be focusing on getting Mom back!	[]

Kyle	13	0	He won't listen to us, but he would listen to- Gordon Ramsay.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Oy! Bebebebebebebe.	[]
Stan	4	0	That's stupid, Cartman.	[]
