Gerald	3	0	Hey there, Richard!	[]
Richard	5	0	Oh, hey Gerald. New car?	[]
Gerald	22	0	Yeah. It's a hybrid. I just... I just couldn't sit back and-  be a part of destroying the earth anymore.	[]
Richard	4	0	Well... Good for you.	[]
Gerald	2	0	Oho...  Thanks.	[]
Stephen	10	0	Well, there goes the new high-and-mighty Gerald Broflovski.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	16	0	Yeah, ever since he got that new hybrid he thinks he's better than everyone else.	[]
Gerald	27	0	You know, the emissions from a vehicle like yours causes irreparable damage to the ozone. I drive a hybrid; it's much better for the environment.  Thanks.	[]
Kyle	21	0	Dad, can we go home? All you ever do since you got this car is drive around and show it off!	[]
Driver	5	0	Hey, is that a hybrid?	[]
Gerald	9	0	Oh yes. You've got one too, I see.	[]
Driver	21	0	Yeah, I like to be a part of the solution and not part of the problem. Well, anyway,  good for you!	[]
Gerald	1	0	Thanks.	[]
Kyle	8	0	Dad, I think Ike is starving to death.	[]
Gerald	24	0	Hold on, boys. We still have to go to the hardware store, and hand out awareness citations to SUV cars in the parking lot.	[]
Kyle	1	0	What?!	[]
Gerald	29	0	Okay, there's another one.  Aw, man! Look at that!  Can you believe this?! An SUV with a V8 engine, makes me sick!  Ticket for driving a gas-guzzler	[]
Kyle	6	0	Dad, can we go home, please?	[]
Gerald	13	0	Look, there's a Jeep over there! Go write them a ticket, Kyle!	[]
Kyle	4	0	But Dad, I want-	[]
Gerald	2	0	NOW, KYLE!	[]
Stan	3	0	Oh hey Kyle.	[]
Kyle	8	0	Aw, hey dude. What are you doing here?	[]
Stan	14	0	Helping my Dad pick out some cool new power tools. What are you doing?	[]
Kyle	7	0	Helping my Dad give people fake tickets.	[]
Randy	3	0	What's this?	[]
Gerald	9	0	Oh! Sorry Randy. Looks like you got a ticket.	[]
Randy	15	1	A ticket? Failure to care about the environment Oh Goddammit, did you do this, Gerald?!	['goddammit']
Gerald	17	0	Yeah. I'm just, you know, trying to make people more aware ya' know, it's a-	[]
Randy	14	0	You got some nerve, you know that?! Where do you come off ticketing people?!	[]
Gerald	10	0	Well, Randy, calm down. It's not a real ticket.	[]
Randy	8	0	I know it's not a real ticket!!	[]
Jimbo	9	1	Broflovski, did you put this crap on my windshield?!	['crap']
Gerald	12	0	Jimbo, your truck probably gets less than ten miles to the gallon.	[]
Jimbo	4	1	Well thanks, Officer Dickhole!	['dickhole']
Kyle	5	0	Dad, let's just go!	[]
Gerald	18	0	Look, I'm just trying to make the people of South Park aware of a very serious problem.	[]
Randy	26	1	The problem, Gerald, is that ever since you got a hybrid car, you've gotten so smug that you love the smell of your own farts!	['farts']
Gerald	18	0	Oh! I'm sorry! I didn't think it was high and mighty to  care about the earth!	[]
Randy	15	0	And that too! Stop talking with your eyes closed! That's what smug people do!	[]
Gerald	14	0	Well, I really don't see how  that has anything to do with the-	[]
Randy	5	0	There, like that! Stop that!	[]
Darryl	11	2	Who the hell put this faggy fake ticket on my truck!	['hell', 'faggy']
Gerald	19	0	All right, that does it! Come on, Kyle, I don't want you hanging around with these ignorant idiots!	[]
Gerald	13	0	Yeah. Yeah, I think it's best we just do it right away.	[]
Kyle	19	0	Dad.  Dad, Ike and I have been talking, and well, we feel that your new car is changing you.	[]
Gerald	4	0	Yes, it certainly is.	[]
Kyle	12	0	We're thinking that a lot of people in town starting too...	[]
Ike	2	0	Take offense.	[]
Kyle	18	0	...a-are starting to take offense at your actions. We feel like you're starting to become-hmm...	[]
Ike	1	0	Alienated.	[]
Kyle	10	0	...star-starting to become alienated from some of your friends.	[]
Gerald	5	0	Well, I totally agree, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	2	0	You do??	[]
Gerald	15	0	Yes. A lot of people in town just aren't ready to drive hybrid cars.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Righ!  Okay, good.	[]
Gerald	18	0	And that's why,  I've talked it over with your mother, and  ...we've decided to MOVE!	[]
Kyle	1	0	What??	[]
Gerald	26	0	We need to be where everyone is motivated and progressive like us! Start getting your things packed, boys! The Broflovksi family is moving to San Francisco!	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah?	[]
Butters	19	0	Uh hay, Stan. Uh you should come on over. Uh they're havin' a goin'-away party for Kyle.	[]
Stan	7	0	Going away party? What do you mean?	[]
Butters	9	0	Well don't you know? Kyle's movin' away.	[]
Stan	7	0	Moving away?? Kyle can't move away!	[]
Butters	3	0	Well he is.	[]
Stan	6	0	Where's the going-away party?	[]
Butters	4	0	At Cartman's house.	[]
Cartman	19	0	Hey everybody! There's more pop in the refrigerator. Let's make this the best going-away party EVER!	[]
Token	5	0	Hey Eric, where's Kyle?	[]
Cartman	1	0	Who?	[]
Clyde	4	0	Kyle, the person leaving.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Kyle? Why would I invite Kyle?	[]
Craig	16	0	Dude, a going-away party is supposed to be for the person who is going away!	[]
Stan	2	0	Kyle? Kyle!	[]
Clyde	9	0	Kyle's not here. Cartman didn't invite him.	[]
Stan	1	0	What?!	[]
Cartman	31	1	You guys, this is our party. That no-good back-stabbing Jew rat is finally leaving! Come on, everyone! Let's sing! 'Nanana na! Nanana na! Hey hey hey! Goodbye Kyle!	['jew']
Stan	6	0	Kyle! Du-what is going on?!	[]
Kyle	9	0	My Dad says he can't live here anymore.	[]
Stan	8	0	Mr. Broflovski, please. Kyle's my best friend.	[]
Gerald	17	1	I'm sorry, Stan, but unfortunately you live in a small-minded town filled with ignorant boobs.	['boobs']
Stan	5	0	Well... Maybe they'll change.	[]
Gerald	13	0	I wouldn't count on it. Come on, boys, get in the car!	[]
Stan	1	0	Nooo!	[]
Gerald	30	0	Maybe you can make a difference, Stan.  Maybe you can get everyone to drive hybrid cars. Until that day,  we're just gonna have to be  with our own kind.	[]
Stan	13	0	I will. I will get everyone to drive hybrid cars! I swear it!	[]
Gerald	6	0	Well? What do you think, huh?	[]
Sheila	5	0	Oh Gerald, it's beautiful.	[]
Gerald	6	0	Yeah. Now THIS, is a house.	[]
Man	9	0	Oh hello there, you must be the new neighbors.	[]
Gerald	8	0	Yes that's right. We're the Broflovskis.	[]
Man	27	0	Welcome to San Francisco. I'm Peter Thompson. This is my wife, Nancy Jarvis, and our son, Brian Thompson-Jarvis  So how do you like the neighborhood?	[]
Sheila	10	0	Oh it's gorgeous. These old houses are so neat.	[]
Peter	21	0	Yes, well, unlike most cities, in San Francisco we try to  keep all the historic houses instead of knocking them down.	[]
Man 2	4	0	You in here, Peter?	[]
Peter	10	0	Oh hay, Paul. Come on in and meet the Broflovskis	[]
Paul	20	0	Hello there. I'm Paul McDonahue. This is my wife, Paulie Beaumont-McCallahan, and our daughter, Mindy McDonahue-Beaumont-McCallahan	[]
Gerald and Sheila	1	0	Hello.	[]
Paul	12	0	We noticed your hybrid out front - that's a V series, right?	[]
Gerald	4	0	Yeah. That's right.	[]
Peter	20	0	Whoa, nice car, but we're gonna have to get you into the BT series  Its emissions are actually cleaner.	[]
Gerald	8	0	Wow, so, everyone here drives a hybrid, huh?	[]
Peter	30	0	Oh, of course. We're a little more progressive and ahead of the curve here in San Francisco.  Ahhhm.  Anyway, I'm sure you'll find it much better here.	[]
Paul	37	0	Yes, you'll find that San Francisco is pretty much more open-minded and grown-up than the Midwest.  Ahhh,  ahh,  ahh.  We're just a little bit more protective of our environment here in San Francisco	[]
Gerald	4	0	Yeah. We sure are.	[]
Stan	7	0	Come on, people. Come on, people now.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Dude, what are you doing?	[]
Stan	18	0	I'm writing a song about the importance of hybrid cars, so maybe people will change their ways.	[]
Cartman	4	1	THAT's gay, heh.	['gay']
Stan	19	0	Well if I have any chance of getting Kyle back, I have to get people to stop driving SUVs!	[]
Cartman	16	0	Why do you want Kyle back?? Don't you see how awesome it is without him?	[]
Stan	28	0	You know, Cartman, you may be stoked now, but I bet you're gonna find that withuot Kyle around to rip on, your life is empty, and hollow.	[]
Cartman	21	1	Psh! Whatever dude. I don't need Kyle to rip on, I've got Butters. Come on, Butters, you stupid Jew!	['jew']
Butters	6	1	Yeah! I'm a dumb Jew.	['jew']
Stan	7	0	Come on, people. Come on, people now.	[]
DJ	48	0	All right, all you dreamers and creamers out there out there in South Park, I'm gonna play a song by a local artist that really made me think about my impact on the earth. This is Stan Marsh with Hey, People, You've Gotta Drive Hybrids Already.	[]
Stan	46	0	Come on now, people now people now' People now, come on now, people now Got to drive hybrids, people now People now, people now, people now Hybrids are for people now, people now Group of people driving people now Get a hybrid, be good people now.	[]
Customer	3	0	He's right.	[]
Stan	43	0	We have all got to be people now People-driving-hybrid people now People now, people now, hybrid now Hybrid-people-driving people now. Come on, people, let's be people now Hybrid-people-driving people now Come on, everybody be people now	[]
Jimbo	12	0	Yeah, I just wanted to  try to set an example, you know?	[]
Jimbo	1	0	Thanks.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	10	0	Can you believe some people still don't drive hybrids?	[]
Randy	15	0	I know! It's like Earth to America? Hello? This is simple stuff here. Gawl	[]
Mr. Mackey	22	0	Well from now on, I'm only going to associate with other hybrid-car drivers. Everyone else is just ignorant, m'kay?	[]
Driver 1	3	0	Good for you!	[]
Driver 2	1	0	Thanks!	[]
Randy	9	0	At least we're smart enough to know better!	[]
Driver 3	1	0	Thanks!	[]
Stan	6	0	Come on, everybody be people now	[]
Speaker	25	0	And so we are here to honor Stan Marsh for making South Park the city with the highest percentage of hybrid owners in the country!	[]
Richard	13	0	If only the rest of the country  was as insightful as we are.	[]
Stan	34	0	Ah, thanks. I was really just trying to make it so my friend can move back here so... if you don't mind, I'm gonna try to get a hold of him now.	[]
Jimbo	2	0	Great speech!	[]
Gerald	15	0	Yeah, well, you know my son is just  a little bit more clever than some.	[]
An officer	29	0	Hello there, I'm Ranger McFriendly. I'm the person who watches over the delicate ecosystem of South Park. You must be the little boy who wrote that song.	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Ranger McFriendly	1	0	Uhh!	[]
Stan	1	0	Ow!	[]
Ranger McFriendly	14	1	You son of a bitch! Do you have any idea what you've done?!	['bitch']
Stan	1	0	What?!	[]
Ranger McFriendly	3	0	Come with me!	[]
Ranger McFriendly	2	0	There! Look!	[]
Stan	10	0	Smog? There's never been smog over South Park before.	[]
Ranger McFriendly	33	0	Don't you get it?! When people drive hybrid cars, they get so full of themselves they spew tons of self-satisfied garbage into the air! That isn't smog, it's smug!	[]
Stan	1	0	Smug?	[]
Ranger McFriendly	51	1	Hybrid cars make better for emission levels, but people who drive hybrid cars are the leading cause of smug. You can have smug in the atmosphere, and you know what that leads to? Glodal laming! Thanks to your gay little song, South Park is now the second smuggiest city in America!	['gay']
Announcer	8	0	This is a South Park News Weather Bulletin!	[]
Anchor Tom	20	0	It looks like we have a smug alert here in South Park. Our own Keenan Williams has the details. Keenan?	[]
Keenan	60	0	Thanks, Tom, a smug alert is in effect at least tomorrow morning.  All those hybrid cars on the road have caused heavy smug to develop over most of Park and Jefferson Counties. On the national map, we can see smug over Denver and developing smug in Los Angeles. However, San Francisco is once again the smuggiest city in the country.	[]
Singer	7	0	A smuggy day in San Francisco town.	[]
Paul	7	0	Sheila, did you meet Gail and Brian?	[]
Sheila	5	0	No! Hello, how are you?	[]
Gail	4	0	Really good, really good.	[]
Gerald	4	0	Hey there. Alan, right?	[]
Alan	4	0	Actually, it's Alain	[]
Gerald	11	0	Right right, w-would, would you like red or white wine?	[]
Alan	7	0	Can I just get an empty glass?	[]
Gerald	2	0	Oh. Sure.	[]
Alan	15	0	Can you believe all these imbeciles in Texas? They just put another prisoner to death.	[]
Kyle	7	0	So... what do you do for fun?	[]
Brian	5	1	We drink and take drugs.	['drugs']
Boy 1	5	0	Do you want some acid?	[]
Kyle	9	0	Oh, no thanks. We don't do that stuff.	[]
Boy 2	15	1	You will. There's a reason most San Francisco kids take a lot of drugs.	['drugs']
Brian	26	1	It's the only thing that allows us to deal with our parents all walking around loving the smell of their own farts all the time.	['farts']
Gerald	5	0	Everything okay in here, Kyle?	[]
Kyle	3	0	Yeah, fine, Dad.	[]
Gerald	13	0	So much better here with the intellectuals, isn't it, boys?  Wuhh  Mmmm.	[]
Kyle	11	0	Well... maybe I'll take just half a hit of acid.	[]
Ike	3	0	I want three.	[]
Stan	19	0	No, no, I'm asking if there's a listing for Broflovski in San Francisco! They just moved there!	[]
Cartman	15	1	Haha! Take that, Jew boy! I guess you Heebs can't even play video football!	['jew']
Butters	4	0	Yeah. You're right.	[]
Cartman	9	1	You know Butters, you make for a lousy Jew.	['jew']
Butters	16	1	Well I'm sorry. Well it's just that I'm not Jewish, and now th-	['jewish']
Cartman	7	1	No, no! Don't apologize, you asshole!	['asshole']
Ranger McFriendly	1	0	Marsh!	[]
Stan	4	1	Oh crap, Ranger McFriendly.	['crap']
Cartman	1	0	Who?	[]
Ranger McFriendly	17	0	You'd better come with me to the news station! Our situation just got a lot worse!	[]
Keenan	24	0	I noticed it on the computer this morning. Look here.  This is the smug over South Park. It's... getting bigger and gaining strength.	[]
Cartman	2	0	The smug?	[]
Keenan	34	0	The smug is getting so massive that it's moving west... and fusing with the San Francisco smug... Here.  These two smug clouds are combining, fueling each other.  Now take a look at this.	[]
Stan	3	0	What is that?	[]
Keenan	14	0	It's the smug from George Clooney's acceptance speech at the Academy Awards.	[]
Stan	5	0	George Clooney's acceptance speech?	[]
Keenan	91	0	Did you hear it? He talked about how people in Hollywood are ahead of the curve on social mattes. He even took credit for the Civil Rights movement -Look!! The point is... the smug from his acceptance speech has been slowly drifting north since he gave it... and is headed straight for the super cell. The South Park and San Francisco smug is already at critical mass. If it gets hit by George Clooney's acceptance speech, it will be a disaster of epic proportions. The perfect storm... of self-satisfaction.	[]
Ranger McFriendly	19	0	We've got to tell the townspeople! South Park still has a chance to make it through the storm!	[]
Stan	4	0	What about San Francisco?	[]
Keenan	15	1	Kid, thanks to your gay little song, there's not gonna be a San Francisco.	['gay']
Ranger McFriendly	35	0	Soo, that's it people.  When the smug from George Clooney's speech hits the San Francisco and South Park smug, we're gonna witness a storm the likes of which we've never seen.	[]
Randy	17	0	Are you trying to tell us the smug from our hybrids is actually gonna kill us all?	[]
Ranger McFriendly	10	0	If the smug clouds remain the way they are, yes.	[]
Jimbo	20	2	This is all Stan's fault! He wrote that gay little song and got us to drive those damned hybrids!	['gay', 'damned']
Randy	4	0	Yeah. Good going, stupid!	[]
Ranger McFriendly	43	0	Listen! Though we all agree this is Stan's fault, there is still something we can do. If we all work together to reduce smugness, we might be able to lessen the effects of the storm, at least here in our own town.	[]
Stephen	21	0	Then that's it. There's only one way to reduce smugness. We've gotta destroy every hybrid car in town!	[]
Jimbo	9	0	Everyone get your hybrid and meet at Dawson's!	[]
Randy	8	0	Hey, where do you think YOU're going?!	[]
Stan	13	0	I'm gonna try and warn Kyle to get out of San Francisco.	[]
Randy	23	1	Oh no you're not! Your gay little song got us to drive hybrids; you're gonna help us get rid of 'em!	['gay']
Ranger McFriendly	10	0	How long do we have until the smug clouds collide?	[]
Keenan	17	0	Not long. The smug from George Clooney's Academy Awards Acceptance Speech has already crossed into Arizona.	[]
Attendant	4	1	The hell is that?	['hell']
Butters	11	0	Wow, Eric. You sure are a great guy for doing this.	[]
Cartman	25	0	I don't have a choice. Somebody has to get into San Francisco and warn Kyle's family to get out before the storm hits.	[]
Butters	14	0	But... how come we can't just take the bus on into the city?	[]
Cartman	88	0	You don't know San Francisco, Butters.  It was the breeding ground for the hippie movement in the 60s. Those hard-core liberals, lesbian activists, and die hard modern hippies young and old.  I swore I would never set foot in San Francisco. God help me.  All right, Butters, I'll be tethered to you through this cord. It's my only lifeline, so make sure it stays taut. If you stop hearing my voice, for the love of Christ, start reeling me in with all your strength.	[]
Butters	12	0	I will. You're really great for going to warn Kyle, Eric.	[]
Cartman	24	0	I'm not doin' it for Kyle.  I can't believe I'm actually going to walk through San Francisco. Well, here it goes.	[]
Ranger McFriendly	12	0	All right. All right, now get it into the masher! Hurry up!	[]
Stan	11	0	Can't somebody else operate this? I can't really reach.	[]
Ranger McFriendly	30	1	Well then you shouldn't have written that gay little song, shouldn't you have?!  Keenan, we've gotten rid of half the hybrid cars! How are the smug levels?!	['gay']
Keenan	12	0	They're dropping, slowly, but... but we're running out of time!	[]
Man	16	0	Yeah, it's like, San Francisco is more of a European city, like Paris or Milan.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Butters, are you there?!	[]
Butters	4	0	I'm here, Eric.	[]
Cartman	20	0	I've started to enter the smug. I'm about a quarter mile in. Can you give me an EL?	[]
Butters	14	0	You must be nearing Union Square. Did you see a fountain to your left?	[]
Cartman	11	0	Yes. It's just beyond yet another wine and cheese store.	[]
Butters	14	0	Wait, uhh, eh take your next right. You've got to start heading west.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Turning right at O two four niner.	[]
Randy	9	0	That's it. That's that the last one.	[]
Ranger McFriendly	8	0	Keenan? Keenan, we've smashed the last hybrid!	[]
Keenan	21	0	Harry, the smug from Clooney's speech is about to hit the other smug system! Get everyone inside!  God help us.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Butters?! Butters, I think I'm here! 2419 Castillo?!	[]
Butters	11	0	That's it! Eric, hurry! Somethin's goin' on out here!	[]
Cartman	12	0	Mr. Broflovski! Mr. Broflovski, there a smug storm! We have to go!	[]
Gerald	6	0	Being smug is a good thing.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Oh my CHRIST!  Kyle? Kyle!	[]
Kyle	8	1	The acid. Dude, I'm totally tripping balls.	['balls']
Ike	10	2	I'm totally tripping balls. I'm totally tripping balls.	['balls', 'balls']
Cartman	10	0	We have to get out of here! Now!  Kyle! Kyle!!	[]
Network Anchor	53	1	And now, the worst appears to be over. Last night's smug storm... has left thousands homeless. All across the Midwest, people are picking up the pieces. Cities like Denver and South Park are heavily damaged, but still all right. However, San Francisco, I'm afraid... has disappeared completely up its own asshole.	['asshole']
Stan	1	0	No...	[]
Randy	14	1	I'm sorry, Stan. I'm sorry your gay little song killed your friend.	['gay']
Clyde	14	0	Hey! Hey, Stan! You're not gonna believe it! You've gotta come see!	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Clyde	4	0	It's a miracle!	[]
Stan	1	0	Kyle!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Hey Stan.	[]
Stan	3	0	Dude, what happened??	[]
Gerald	23	0	We don't know. We were all passed out and... next thing we know we just woke up on a bus heading here.	[]
Mr. Mackey	10	0	It's like you had a guardian angel, m'kay?	[]
Stan	9	0	Dude, I'm so glad you're not dead.	[]
Richard	12	0	So I guess there's nothing left to do now but... rebuild.	[]
Randy	10	0	Yeah. First off, we're all gonna need new cars.	[]
Gerald	11	0	And let's make sure nobody gets a stupid hybrid, right?	[]
Kyle	7	0	NO! Hybrid cars are a good thing!	[]
Mr. Mackey	11	0	But hybrid cars are the leading cause of smug, m'kay?	[]
Kyle	39	0	Hybrid cars don't cause smugness, people do.  Look, hybrid cars are important. They may even save our planet one day. What you all need to do is just learn to drive hybrids and not be smug about it.	[]
Randy	18	0	You mean... drive in hybrids... but not act like we're better than everyone else because of it.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Randy	6	0	I'm...  I'm not ready...	[]
Gerald	9	0	I don't think I can do it either.	[]
Mr. Mackey	6	0	It's simply asking too much.	[]
Randy	25	0	Perhaps... one day... we can learn to drive hybrids without being smug about it, but for now... the technology is just too much for us.	[]
Gerald	10	0	Come on, everybody! Let's go buy wasteful gas guzzlers!	[]
Cartman	10	0	Well, looks like you're back for good, huh Kyle?	[]
Kyle	4	0	Yeah, I guess so.	[]
Cartman	14	1	We just can't get rid of you, can we, you sneaky Jew rat!	['jew']
Kyle	8	1	Don't belittle my people, you fucking fatass!	['fucking']
Cartman	4	0	Ah, that's better.	[]
