Mr. Garrison	7	0	You wanted to see me, Principal Victoria?	[]
Principal Victoria	23	0	Yes, Mr. Garrison. Have a seat.  Mr. Garrison, sometime ago you asked to be promoted from teaching kindergarten back to the third grade.	[]
Mr. Garrison	5	0	I'm aware of that.	[]
Principal Victoria	35	1	I wanna come clean with you and tell you that back then some of us were uncomfortable with your sexual preferences. It was wrong of us, and I want to make it up to you.	['sexual']
Mr. Garrison	7	0	Wow, that's... really great to hear.	[]
Principal Victoria	21	0	As you know, the position of Fourth Grade teacher has become available, and we'd like to offer YOU the job.	[]
Mr. Garrison	7	0	Oh, for real? You're not kidding?	[]
Principal Victoria	18	0	We in administration see now that you are an individual with your own preferences, and we respect that.	[]
Mr. Garrison	21	0	Oh, this is all just... this is a dream come true!  Thank you, Principal Victoria! I'll do a great job!	[]
Principal Victoria	4	0	I know you will.	[]
Mr. Garrison	21	1	You're sure this is for real? I mean, I'm not gonna just get fired again for being gay tomorrow.	['gay']
Principal Victoria	6	0	It's for real, Mr. Garrison.	[]
Mr. Garrison	3	1	Oh-ho, great!	['ho']
Principal Victoria	25	1	With all the new laws we could never fire you for being gay now. You'd be able to sue us for millions of dollars.	['gay']
Mr. Garrison	6	0	Right uh-  Wha- ...what was that?	[]
Principal Victoria	34	1	Well, I was just saying that the policies have really changed. You know, we fire you for acting gay next time, you'd be able to sue the school district for ...lots of money.	['gay']
Mr. Garrison	10	0	...Oh right, right, right, I... Huh-... how much money, exactly?	[]
Principal Victoria	18	0	Oh. Well, there was the case out in Minnesota where the guy was awarded... 25 million, I think.	[]
Mr. Garrison	24	1	Yeh-you don't say.  Well thanks, uh, Principal Victoria.  Holy Moly! I've gotta find a way to get fired for being gay!	['gay']
Mr. Mackey	21	0	M'kay kids, I know the past few weeks have been really hard with the death of your teacher, Ms. Choksondik.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Funny.	[]
Mr. Mackey	30	0	BUT... the principal has finally hired a teacher to take her place. So I want you all to give your best behavior to your new Fourth Grade teacher, Mr. Garrison.	[]
Kids	1	0	AWWWW!!!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Not him!	[]
Mr. Garrison	4	0	Thank you, Mr. Mackey.	[]
Mr. Mackey	4	0	Good luck, m'kay.	[]
Mr. Garrison	15	0	Okay, children, now for those of you who are new, my name is  Mr. Garrison.	[]
Butters	5	0	Where is Mr. Hat, sir?	[]
Mr. Garrison	15	0	Well, I was informed that fourth graders are a little too old for Mr. Hat.	[]
Kyle	9	0	Two-year-olds are too old for Mr. Hat.	[]
Mr. Garrison	17	0	But it's okay because I found a new teacher's assistant. Say hello to...  Mr. Slave.	[]
Mr. Slave	3	0	Hi kids. Hm.	[]
Mr. Garrison	21	1	So that's  Mr. Slave.  The teacher's assistant.  Or, as I like to write for short, the Teacher's Ass.	['ass']
Mr. Slave	3	0	Oh Jesus Christ.	[]
Mr. Garrison	9	0	Okay, Mr. Slave. Go sit until I need you.	[]
Mr. Slave	1	0	Ugh.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Dude, I think that Mr. Slave guy might by a...  Pakistani.	[]
Mr. Garrison	28	0	I'm not saying the rest of the school year will be easy. In fact, it's going to be long and hard.  Really long and really hard.	[]
Mr. Slave	3	0	Oh Jesus Christ.	[]
Mr. Garrison	13	0	Eheh, the first thing we're gonna be learning about is communist Russia.	[]
Cartman	7	0	No, Kenny. What are you doing, Kenny?	[]
Mr. Garrison	10	0	Now, Stalin was a big silly when it came to...	[]
Cartman	7	0	Kenny, no! Don't do it, Kenny!	[]
Mr. Garrison	8	0	Eric, did you just throw a paper airplane?!	[]
Cartman	4	0	No, it was Kenny!	[]
Mr. Garrison	6	0	Very funny, Eric! Kenny's dead!	[]
Stan	18	0	Yeah, but Cartman drank Kenny's remains, and now Kenny's soul is trapped in Cartman's body.	[]
The Other Kids	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Mr. Garrison	22	0	That does it! I will not put up with foolishness in my class! It's time for punishment!  Take it Mr. Slave!	[]
Mr. Slave	5	0	Oh-oh. Oh it hurts.	[]
Mr. Garrison	34	0	I will  NOT put up with  TOM foolery in my  CLASS room, children.  Mr. Slave, put this rubber ball in your mouth.  Take that, Slavey! take it!  This'll get me fired for sure.	[]
Gerald	14	0	I really enjoyed the imagery in the last chapter of this month's book.	[]
Linda	15	0	Yes, and I really saw the entire book thematically as a take on corporate America.	[]
Randy	30	0	Well I think in the fourth chapter, when uh Nancy Drew discovers the bloody glove in the cheerleader's locker, well that uh that was just a brilliantly written passage.	[]
Gerald	4	0	So full of metaphor.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Hey guys, can we talk to you?	[]
Sheila	3	0	Oh, hi boys.	[]
Sharon	3	0	How was school?	[]
Kyle	3	0	Uhh, not cool.	[]
Sheila	23	0	That's great. We're having our book of the month club meeting, so why don't you boys go outside and play?	[]
Linda	21	0	Was it me, or did you all think that Nancy Drew solved the riddle of Elephant Mountain a little too easily?	[]
Stan	23	0	No, no, he said not cool. We got our new teacher today; it's, it's Mr. Garrison, our old third grade teacher.	[]
Chris	2	0	Uh huh.	[]
Kyle	16	1	Well, he has this new teacher's assistant, and uh and they're both... totally gay.	['gay']
Sheila	9	1	Kyle! You know better than to discriminate against homosexuals!	['homosexuals']
Stan	8	1	Yeah but, these guys are really super-gay.	['gay']
Randy	20	0	Aw I'm surprised at you, Stanley. I really thought you knew how to accept people for what they were.	[]
Sharon	3	0	Yeah, but Dad-	[]
Randy	12	0	No buts, Stanley! We're not raising our kids to be discriminators!	[]
Sheila	19	0	That's right! I think it's time you kids took a little trip to the Museum of Tolerance!	[]
Tour Guide	21	0	Welcome to the Museum of Tolerance. Here we try to educate you on the dynamics of racism and prejudice in America.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Ey!	[]
Tour Guide	36	0	Now, did you know that words we use can show intolerance?  Let's begin our tour with a walk through our Tunnel of Prejudice, to show you what it can feel like to be discriminated against.	[]
Voice	8	3	QUEER. BEANER. CHINK. NIGGER. HEEB. FAGGOT. CRACKER. SLOPE.	['queer', 'nigger', 'faggot']
Cartman	5	0	Aw man, this is awesome!	[]
Tour Guide	6	0	Now you know how it feels.	[]
Cartman	8	0	I wanna ride again! I wanna ride again!	[]
Tour Guide	44	0	We are now entering the Hall of Stereotypes. These wax figures represent how some intolerant people have labeled minorities.  Here we see a black person eating chicken and watermelon, a stereotype that hurts the African-American community. What other stereotypes do you see here?	[]
Randy	8	0	Ah, here's the Arab as a terrorist.	[]
Tour Guide	18	0	That's right. But of course, we know that not all Arabs are terrorists, don't we, kids?	[]
Butters	12	0	W-w-well there's an Asian over there with a calculator.	[]
Tour Guide	24	0	That's right. Not all stereotypes are negative. But even a positive one like All Asians are good at math is harmful to society.	[]
Cartman	4	1	Look, a covetous Jew!	['jew']
Tour Guide	17	1	Very good, young man. The idea that Jews are only interested in money is very old indeed.	['jews']
Randy	12	0	Ah, here's a good one.  It's the stereotypical sleepy Mexican.	[]
Janitor	8	0	Wai-what? Oh man, what time is it?	[]
Randy	11	0	Oh I'm sorry. I thought you were a wax sculpture.	[]
Janitor	21	0	Naw, man. I'm the janitor. I'm s'pose to be cleaning but I'm so tired. Ongh, so sleepy.	[]
Tour Guide	39	0	This is our discovery wing. Take your time at the computer displays , because you see, being tolerant you must also respect people who are small, people who are disabled, even people who are overweight,  like this young man here.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Ey!	[]
Tour Guide	17	3	You other boys have probably called this young man names like tubby, or lardbutt, or fat tits,...	['lardbutt', 'fat', 'tits']
Kyle	7	2	Fat tits. That's a good one.	['fat', 'tits']
Stan	6	0	Yeah, I have to remember that.	[]
Tour Guide	24	1	But you must learn to be tolerant of his differences as well. If he chooses to eat fatty foods, that's his life choice.	['fatty']
Cartman	10	1	I'm not fat, I have a different life choice.	['fat']
Tour Guide	15	0	And we won't belittle you for eating lots of cookies and cakes and pies.	[]
Cartman	4	1	Duhuhude, tolerance kicks ass!	['ass']
Randy	4	0	That's our Cartman.	[]
Tour Guide	8	0	Well, that's the end of our tour.	[]
Randy	10	0	Now do you see why tolerance is so important, boys?	[]
Stan	2	0	I guess.	[]
Tour Guide	22	1	We have to accept people for who they are and what they like to do.  Hey! What the hell are you doing?	['hell']
Smoker	5	0	Oh I was just uh-	[]
Tour Guide	7	0	There's no smoking in the museum!	[]
Smoker	7	0	But I'm not in the museum.	[]
Tour Guide	7	0	Get out of here, you filthy smoker!	[]
Gerald	3	0	Yeah, dirty lungs!	[]
Sharon	8	0	Go ahead and kill yourself, stupid tar-breath!	[]
Chris	1	1	Dumbass!	['dumbass']
Richard	4	0	Get out of here!	[]
Tour Guide	6	0	Well, have a great day, everybody.	[]
Chris	16	0	Now you boys can go and give your teacher and assistant the respect they deserve. Right?	[]
The Boys	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Mr. Garrison	51	0	Okay, children, let's take our seats. Uh, apparently, none of you tried to get me fired yesterday, so I guess we're just gonna have to go on and learn more today.  Now who can tells me what happens to water when we heat it up in the Bunsen burner?	[]
Butters	2	0	It evaporates.	[]
Mr. Garrison	68	2	Good, Butters. Now if we take the glass tube of the Bunsen burner, we can also see how other things react.  Evaporation is an exothermic reaction, so let's look at an endothermic one. Mr. Slave, position 7 please.  Now I'm gonna put the glass tube under Mr. Slave's tight ass.  The heat from Mr. Slave's ass will act as our new conductor of energy	['ass', 'ass']
Mr. Slave	1	0	AAH.	[]
Mr. Garrison	11	0	Okay, now Butters, could you bring over Lemmiwinks for me please?	[]
Butters	1	0	Sure.	[]
Stan	7	0	Oh, no, no, no no no no.	[]
Mr. Garrison	46	1	Newton was the first to discover that for every action there's a reaction - thank you Butters. Now what do you think is gonna happen when I introduce the element of the gerbil to the endothermic heat of Mr. Slave's ass?  Well let's see.	['ass']
Mr. Slave	6	0	AAH.  AAH.  Dude! Jesus Christ! AAH!	[]
Butters	2	0	Lemmiwinks? NO!	[]
Chef	3	0	Hello there, children!	[]
The Boys	2	0	Hey Chef.	[]
Chef	4	0	How's it goin'?	[]
Kyle	1	0	Bad.	[]
Chef	2	0	Why bad?	[]
Stan	4	0	Chef, we're intolerant.	[]
Chef	3	0	...Intolerant of who?	[]
Kyle	3	1	Gays, I guess.	['gays']
Chef	17	1	Now why do you wanna go be intolerant of gay people, children?  I thought you knew better.	['gay']
Stan	21	0	Well we didn't think we were, but Mr. Garrison has this new assistant, and we're really uncomfortable around him.	[]
Chef	37	1	Children, a lot of times the reason get uncomfortable around gay people is that they have some issues themselves. You have to ask yourself, What is it about their behavior that, for some reason, makes me uncomfortable?	['gay']
Kyle	18	1	Well, I guess it's mostly the way Mr. Garrison stuck a gerbil up Mr. Slave's ass.	['ass']
Chef	13	0	Right. And you see, children, that's why you need to- Whoa! What?!	[]
Stan	4	1	Are we homophobes now?	['homophobes']
Kyle	8	1	We don't wanna be gay bashers, Chef.	['gay']
Chef	16	1	Children, there's a BIG difference between gay people and Mr. Garrison! Do you understand that??	['gay']
Stan	2	0	N-no?	[]
Chef	15	0	You children just take your lunches. I'm gonna have a talk with the principal.	[]
Cartman	7	0	I'll take three lunches today, please.	[]
Chef	14	1	You don't need three lunches, Eric! You're fat enough as it is!	['fat']
Cartman	20	0	It is my life choice, Chef, and if you don't tolerate it I'll report you to the SEC.	[]
Mr. Garrison	22	1	That was a brilliant idea, having me put a gerbil up your ass, Mr. Slave.  Now we'll get fired for sure!	['ass']
Mr. Slave	13	1	Well it wasn't the first small animal I put up my ass.	['ass']
Principal Victoria	8	0	Mr. Garrison to the principal's office, please?	[]
Mr. Garrison	17	1	That's it! They're gonna fire me for being gay! Twenty-five million here we cooome.	['gay']
Mr. Slave	10	0	Don't forget, I get half. Oooooh!  Oooooh, Jesus Christ.	[]
Frog King	68	0	Lemmiwinks, you must find a way out of this place, or you will surely die.  This way has been closed off by the Great Sphincter. To escape you must journey upward to the dark reaches of the intestine and past the stomach.  Who am I? Just a friend. Heed my words, Lemmiwinks. Your time is running out. Make for the large intestine. All will be made clear then.	[]
Singer	47	2	A great adventure is waiting for you ahead. Hurry onward, Lemmiwinks, or you will soon be dead. The journey before you may be long and filled with woe But you must escape the gay man's ass so your tale can be told. Lemmiwinks. Lehehemiwinks Lemmiwinks Lemmiwinks-	['gay', 'ass']
Mr. Garrison	7	0	You wanted to see me, Principal Victoria?	[]
Principal Victoria	8	0	Oh yes, uh, Mr. Garrison, have a seat	[]
Mr. Garrison	8	0	Oh dear, sounds like I'm gettin' fired.	[]
Principal Victoria	24	0	Mr. Garrison, Chef has brought it to my attention that some uh students are a bit... uuuncomfortable about certain aspects of your teaching methods.	[]
Mr. Garrison	31	0	Oh no, you're firing me? Oh well, I can't stop being who I am. I can't help the way God made me. Guess I just have to go.	[]
Principal Victoria	8	0	No no no we're not firing you.	[]
Mr. Garrison	3	0	...You're not?	[]
Principal Victoria	9	0	No, we're sending Chef to a tolerance seminar.	[]
Chef	13	1	Sending Chef to a tolerance seminar?! You've got to be fuckin' crazy!!	['fuckin']
Principal Victoria	27	1	You demonstrate a lack of tolerance for Mr. Garrison's behavior. In fact, I believe you used the words sick queer to describe his conduct in class?	['queer']
Chef	5	1	He IS a sick queer!!	['queer']
Mr. Garrison	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Principal Victoria	19	0	I just wanted to give you an opportunity to apologize to Mr. Garrison before I send you away, Chef.	[]
Chef	4	1	Kiss my black ass!!	['ass']
Mr. Mackey	22	1	Parents, I had to call you in here because your boys have refused to attend class with their homosexual teachers, m'kay?	['homosexual']
Stan	11	1	We're not staying in class another minute with those queermos!	['queermos']
Randy	27	0	Well I really thought you boys really learned something in the Museum of Tolerance, but apparently all you learned was new words to call your poor teachers!	[]
Butters	4	0	But they killed Lemmiwinks!	[]
Chris	10	0	Shut your mouth, Butters! You'll speak when spoken to!	[]
Butters	2	0	Yes sir.	[]
Chris	20	0	Mr. Mackey, we've done everything we can to raise compassionate children. We don't know where else to turn.	[]
Mr. Mackey	21	0	Well there is an intensive seminar camp. It's a bit severe, but it might be the only way. M'kay?	[]
Sharon	5	0	That sounds good to me.	[]
Liane	2	0	Mee too.	[]
Sheila	11	0	Then it's settled. Boys, you're going to tolerance camp.	[]
Stan	2	0	Tolerance camp?	[]
Camp Warden	56	0	Welcome to tolerance camp. You are here because you would not accept people's differences.  Because you refuse to accept the life choices of your fellow man. Well those days are now over. Here you vill verk, every hour of every day until you submit to being tolerant of everybody. Here, intolerance... will not be tolerated.	[]
Mr. Garrison	2	1	God-damnit!	['damnit']
Mr. Slave	4	0	How'd it go?	[]
Mr. Garrison	17	0	This is unbelievable, Mr. Slave! It seems no matter what I do I can't get fired!	[]
Mr. Slave	6	0	The principal didn't fire you?	[]
Mr. Garrison	33	0	No! The parents felt so bad that their kids didn't want to attend my class anymore that they wanna give me the Courageous Teacher award this Friday at the Museum of Tolerance!	[]
Mr. Slave	3	0	Oh, Jesus Christ.	[]
Mr. Garrison	17	2	I mean, I stuck a gerbil up your ass and they wanna give me a Goddamn medal!	['ass', 'goddamn']
Mr. Slave	31	1	Well it sounds to me like the principal's just hiding things from everybody. What you need to do is let the parents see what kind of demented faggot you are.	['faggot']
Mr. Garrison	29	0	Oh well-  Hey, that's right, Mr. Slave.  The parents have to see for themselves.  The awards ceremony! Well we'll put on a show they'll never forget!	[]
Mr. Slave	3	0	Oohoohoohoo, Jesus Christ.	[]
Singers	36	2	Lemmiwinks journeyed a distance far and fast. To find his way out of a gay man's ass. The road ahead is filled with danger and fright But push onward, Lemmiwinks, with all of your might.	['gay', 'ass']
Frog King	19	0	Lemmiwinks, you are coming to the entrance of the small intestine. Now you must seek out the Sparrow Prince.	[]
Singers	33	0	The Sparrow Prince lies somewhere way up ahead. Don't look back, Lemmiwinks, or you'll soon be dead. Lemmiwinks, Lemmiwinks, the time is growing late Slow down now and seal your fate.	[]
Sparrow Prince	46	0	I am the Sparrow Prince. Long has my spirit been trapped within this place. Before you lies the maze of the small intestine. One path leads to the stomach, the other to certain doom. Take with you this helmet and torch.  Let them be your guide.	[]
Singers	48	2	Take the magic helmet torch to help you light the way. There's still a lot of ground to cross inside the man so gay. Ahead of you lies adventure, and your strength still lies within. Freedom from the Ass of Doom is the treasure you will win.	['gay', 'ass']
Camp Warden	49	2	Today we will be using the fingerpaint! You vill make a painting that shows people of different races and sexual orientations getting along. Fingerpaint. Fingerpaint!  You vill not make any distinction between people of different colors! People with different sexual preferences! You vill accept everyone!  What are you fingerpainting?!	['sexual', 'sexual']

Mr. Slave	13	0	Almost. I just have to get through a su-  Uh-huc, Jesus Christ.	[]
Mr. Garrison	4	0	What's the matter?	[]
Mr. Slave	10	0	Mm, Just a bit of an upset stomach, I guess.	[]
Mr. Garrison	17	1	Well here, take a Pepto pill. I can't have my teacher's ass under the weather.	['ass']

Mr. Slave	3	0	Yeah, Jesus Christ.	[]
Man 6	12	0	But the mu-se-um tells us to be to-le-rant	[]
Man 3	5	0	Yes. The mu-se-um.	[]
Man 7	6	0	The mu-se-um tells us.	[]
Mr. Garrison	72	0	Tolerant, but not stupid! Look, just because you have to tolerate something doesn't mean you have to approve of it! If you had to like it, it'd be called the Museum of Acceptance!  Tolerate means you're just putting up with it! You tolerate a crying child sitting next to you on the airplane or, or you tolerate a bad cold. It can still piss you off! Jesus Tapdancing Christ!	[]
Randy	18	2	He's right. Our boys didn't hate homosexuals, they just hated the way this asshole was acting.	['homosexuals', 'asshole']
