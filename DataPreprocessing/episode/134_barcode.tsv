Kyle	7	0	What are all you guys doing here?	[]
Clyde	18	1	I don't know. I got this emergency letter from Cartman that said to meet in his basement.	['basement']
Stan	3	0	Yeah, us too.	[]
Cartman	35	0	Ah, gentlemen, thank you for coming. We don't have a lot of time, so I'll cut to the chase. The girls at our school have been hiding something from us, hiding something huge.	[]
Craig	1	0	What?	[]
Cartman	21	0	What if I were to tell you that the girls have a device, which allows them to see... into the future.	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Butters	4	0	How do you know?	[]
Kyle	16	1	The girls do not have a device that shows them the future Cartman. That's retarded.	['retarded']
Clyde	18	1	YOU, SIR, MOCKED CARTMAN BEFORE, YET YOU TWO SIT HERE DEMANDING ANSWERS!  NOW DAMN YOU, LET HIM SPEAK!	['damn']
Cartman	44	0	Thank you, Clyde. Uh, I'm afraid it's true.  I secretly videotaped the girls in the playground yesterday using my Wellington Bear video camera . I caught the following images on tape. I warn you, this images maybe be too shocking for young children.	[]
Butters	5	0	Okay. I'm not lookin'.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Video playback initialized.	[]
Bebe	7	0	Okay, okay. My turn, do me now!	[]
Kale	8	0	Okay Bebe. What do you want to know?	[]
Bebe	16	0	I want to know if I'm gonna live in a big mansion in the future.	[]
Kale	9	0	Okay, let's find out. Ready?  Pick a number.	[]
Bebe	1	0	Four.	[]
Kale	8	0	One, two, three, four. Okay, pick a color.	[]
Bebe	1	0	Blue.	[]
Kale	9	0	B-L-U-E. All right pick another color	[]
Bebe	1	0	Red.	[]
Kale	14	0	'Kaaay. Okay, will Bebe live in a big mansion in the future?  Definitely yes!	[]
Bebe	2	0	All right!	[]
Girls	4	0	Woohoo! You rock, Bebe!	[]
Boys	2	0	Whoa! Wow!	[]
Red	13	0	Do me next. I wanna know if I'm gonna marry somebody cute.	[]
Heidi	11	0	I'll do it! I'll do it!  Pick a number.	[]
Red	1	0	Three.	[]
Heidi	7	0	One, two, three. Now, pick a color.	[]
Clyde	6	0	Where did they get that thing?	[]
Heidi	5	0	G-R-E-E-N.	[]
Red	2	0	Now blue!	[]
Heidi	4	0	The answer is no.	[]
Red	2	0	Aw dangit!	[]
Stan	9	0	Oh my God, how does it know the answer?	[]
Craig	5	0	I... don't believe it.	[]
Cartman	27	0	Believe it. The girls can ask any question they want and it gives the answer. Freeze image!  Gentlemen, we have to get our hands on that device.	[]
Cartman	7	0	How is the incubation shield coming Clyde?	[]
Clyde	24	0	It's all set. Once we have the device, it can be housed in here safely until we know what we're dealing with.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Good man. Any luck here?	[]
Kyle	25	0	The outside of the device seems to be covered in numerals. Inside are colors... which must open up to some sort of temporal time warp.	[]
Cartman	48	0	Good. Keep working. We want to know all we can before we try to operate it.  All right, gentlemen, our containment center for the time warp is nearly complete. All that's left for us to do is get the device from the girls and bring it here.	[]
Craig	5	0	Let's go take it!	[]
Cartman	19	0	Don't be a fool, Craig. Do you really think the girls are just gonna hand that technology over?	[]
Stan	5	0	So what do you suggest?	[]
Cartman	56	0	Heidi Turner  is going to have a slumber party on Thursday night. There's no doubt in my mind the girls will be using the future-telling device there. If we... can get somebody invited to that slumber party, not only can we get a hold of the device, but find out how to use it.	[]
Stan	16	0	Yeah, there's just one problem: a boy can't go to a chicks' slumber party.	[]
Cartman	31	0	No, not a boy, but a girl. One of us is gonna have to go undercover, show up in school tomorrow disguised as the new girl who just moved to town.	[]
Kevin	7	0	You mean like that movie, Juwanna Mann?	[]
Cartman	13	0	No, not like Juwanna Mann, Kevin, okay? It's way cooler than that!	[]
Stan	21	0	But if one of us pretends to be the new girl in class, the girls will wonder where that boy went.	[]
Cartman	33	0	Which is why we have to fake that boy's death. It's simple spy stuff, my friends. Take your top man, fake his death, then send him in disguised as the enemy.	[]
Kyle	8	0	That's a pretty solid idea. But who?	[]
Officer 1	4	0	Mr. and Mrs. Stotch?	[]
Stephen	5	0	Yes? What is it, officer?	[]
Officer 1	5	0	You'd better come quick.	[]
Officer 2	11	0	Your son is at the Bowery Building threatening to kill himself.	[]
Linda	1	0	What?!	[]
Officer 3	12	0	Don't do it son! You have too much to live for!	[]
Linda	4	0	Oh my God, Butters!	[]
Butters	4	0	Oh uh, hi Mom.	[]
Cartman	14	0	Just keep stalling, Butters. We don't have the dead pig quite ready yet.	[]
Stephen	41	0	Butters? Butters, whatever is troubling you, this isn't the answer. Look at all these people who've come out for you! Just come down, son, and... we promise we won't ground you for more than a couple of weeks.	[]
Butters	10	0	N'aw geez! Now I'm gonna get grounded, too.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Okay, it's ready! Step down, Butters.	[]
Linda	9	0	He, h-he's coming down! Oh thank God!	[]
Officer 1	7	0	No, wait. What... what's he doing?	[]
Cartman	3	0	Okay. One! Two!	[]
Officer 3	2	0	JEESUS CHIRST!	[]
Linda	3	0	OHHHH MY GOD!!	[]
Doctor	5	0	He... didn't make it.	[]
Linda	7	0	NOOOOO!! NOOOOO!! My son is DEAD!! NOOOO!!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Nice.	[]
Priest Maxi	55	0	And he shall be remembered as the peaceful little boy who warmed his parent's hearts.  Lord, as we commit this child's body to the earth, may we ask it'd be the last child you strike down so mercilessly. We know this request to be futile, Lord, but just though we would ask.	[]
Linda	15	0	NOOOO! NOOOO! BUTTERS!  Don't put him down there! Don't put him down there!	[]
Ms. Garrison	27	0	Okay children, let's take our seats. Now I know that we're all still in deep, deep mourning over the tragic death of our classmate, Butters.	[]
Red	3	0	Who's Butters?	[]
Ms. Garrison	34	0	But we all must try to move on. And so I'd like you to help me welcome a new student who was just moved here from Dallas. Children please say hello to... Marjorine.	[]
Butters	3	0	Oh... Thank you.	[]
Cartman	13	0	Dude, I think it's totally working. The girls are totally buying it.	[]
Ms. Garrison	13	0	Why don't you tell the children a little bit about yourself, Marjorine?	[]
Butters	22	0	Well, I'm just a typical little girl. I like dancin' and ponies. a-and  getting my snootch pounded on Friday night.	[]
Clyde	1	0	Nice.	[]
Ms. Garrison	27	0	Now Marjorine, that's not very ladylike. Us Colorado girls love to get pounded in the snootch just like any woman, but we keep it to ourselves.	[]
Butters	1	0	Oh...	[]
Bebe	9	0	That girl sure has a strange sense of fashion.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Dude, they totally think he's a girl.	[]
Ms. Garrison	26	0	All right, have a seat, Marjorine. I'm sure all the other girls will be happy to show you around the school.  Won't you, girls?	[]
Red	6	0	Where do you buy your clothes?	[]
Butters	6	0	Oh. Uhm, you know. Girl places.	[]
Cartman	13	0	Dude, they've bought it hook line and sinker.  This is going swimmingly.	[]
Mrs. Turner	11	0	Heidi, sweetie, I'm just gonna set the snacks over here.	[]
Heidi	2	0	'Kay Mom.	[]
Mrs. Turner	16	0	Oh, and Heidi, there's going to be one extra girl coming to your slumber party.	[]
Heidi	1	0	Who?	[]
Mrs. Turner	7	0	The new girl in your class, Marjorine.	[]
Heidi	6	0	Mom, I didn't invite her!	[]
Mrs. Turner	12	0	I know, sweetie, but I got a call from Marjorine's mother.	[]
Heidi	2	0	Her mother?	[]
Mrs. Turner	45	0	She said Marjorine is having a really hard time being in a new school. Her mom asked me personally if we could have Marjorine over, and besides, her mother told me that she works as a state official and that I should  respect her authoratay.	[]
Stephen	5	0	Linda? Linda, please come downstairs.	[]
Linda	12	0	Why couldn't we help him? Why is our little boy dead?	[]
Stephen	9	0	Oh butter! Oh Butters, I miss you so much!	[]
An old farmer	8	0	Mr. Stotch. I know what you're thinkin'.	[]
Stephen	3	0	Who are you?	[]
An old farmer	24	0	I came to talk you out of it. You need to... just accept that your son is dead, not try to bring him back.	[]
Stephen	9	0	Bring him back? W-What are you talking about?	[]
An old farmer	35	0	I know you're thinkin' of puttin'; him up there, the Indian Burial Ground up that road. You're thinking if you bury his body there, he will come back alive. Sometimes, dead is better.	[]
Stephen	3	0	Indian... Burial Ground?	[]
An old farmer	16	0	It's been done before, what you're thinkin' of. The Nelson boy, back in '85.	[]
Stephen	22	0	You're saying if I... dig up my son's body and rebury him at the... old Indian Burial Ground, that I-	[]
An old farmer	72	0	Don't do it Stotch! What comes out of the ground ain't the thing you put in. The Indians knew that. That's why they stopped using it when the ground went sour. I'm just here to talk you out of it.  Don't bury your son's body at the Indian Burial Ground, Stotch! The one that's right up over there, behind Andersons' bar. Sometimes... dead is better.	[]
Stan	8	0	All right, Butters, that's Heidi's house.	[]
Butters	25	0	I can't do it, fellas. I can't go into a girls' slumber party! What if they find out I ain't a girl?	[]
Clyde	5	0	You're gonna be fine.	[]
Cartman	28	0	Now Butters, we don't know exactly what is that girls do at their slumber parties. But if they start, you know, lezzing out, just roll with it.	[]
Butters	6	0	Lezzing out? What's lezzing out?	[]
Kyle	35	1	Now look, Butters, when the girls bring out the future-telling device, pay attention to how it works. Once you know how to operate it, just grab it and get the hell out of there.	['hell']
Butters	16	0	Then I can go home and tell my mommy and daddy I'm not really dead?	[]
Stan	11	0	Yeah dude, of course. Now go, the party's already started.	[]
Clyde	3	0	Good luck, man.	[]
Cartman	25	0	Remember Butters, you must get that future-telling device from the girls at all costs! And just roll with it if they start lezzing out.	[]
Mr. Turner	66	0	All right, now we all want you to have a good time. but as Heidi's parents, tonight it is our responsibility to look out for all of you. There's not gonna be any drinking, no pot, and most importantly, if I catch any boys anywhere near this party, they're gonna be in a world of hurt.  All right, have a nice time, girls.	[]
Heidi	8	0	So, what do you guys wanna do first?	[]
Bebe	5	0	We could play girl talk.	[]
Red	12	0	I bought the new Justin Timberlake CD. We should dance to it.	[]
Butters	8	0	How about we read each other's future?	[]
Wendy	19	0	I know. Let's do Light as a feather, stiff as a board.  Who wants to do it first?	[]
Red	2	0	I will.	[]
Butters	8	0	Oh geez, are we gonna start lezzing out?	[]
Wendy	8	0	Light as a feather, stiff as a board.	[]
Girls	8	0	Light as a feather, stiff as a board!	[]
Kyle	7	0	Jesus, what are they doing in there?	[]
Cartman	20	0	God only knows the horrors that go on in girls' slumber parties. Let's just hope Butters can survive it.	[]
Butters	7	0	AAAAAAAH NOO! Witches! You're all witches!	[]
Heidi	5	0	Marjorine, what is your problem?	[]
Butters	13	0	Huh? Oh nothin'. Hey, you guys wanna tell each other's futures now?	[]
Red	23	0	Yeah. I can tell your future, Marjorine! You're going to live alone your entire life because you're a nerdy, dorky geek.	[]
Heidi	7	0	Yeah, and your hair is totally stupid.	[]
Bebe	5	0	Yeah, and you're flat!	[]
Heidi	11	0	Marjorine, why don't you just leave? Nobody want you here!	[]
Stephen	46	0	Hello son. Don't you worry. Daddy's gonna make everything all right again.  There he is. There's my boy! Come on, Butters!  Oh... Butters... you smell like... bacon  Don't worry. We're gonna bring you back, son. We're gonna bring you back!	[]
Wendy	8	0	I think we went too far with Marjorine.	[]
Bebe	6	0	She's in the bathroom crying.	[]
Heidi	1	0	Marjorine.	[]
Butters	3	0	Nobody likes meee...	[]
Bebe	6	0	Aw gee, she's really upset.	[]
Wendy	16	0	I feel terrible, you guys. It can't be easy being the new girl in school.	[]
Heidi	8	0	Marjorine? Marjorine? Hey, we didn't mean it.	[]
Butters	11	0	You don't know how hard it is to be me.	[]
Bebe	10	0	Marjorine, we were just teasing. We think you're great.	[]
Butters	6	0	You think I'm ugly-ehehee...	[]
Wendy	5	0	You're not ugly, Marjorine.	[]
Butters	7	0	You said I'm ugly and flat.	[]
Heidi	22	0	Marjorine, you just have a different look, that's all. We just... we need to help you bring out your inner beauty.	[]
Wendy	11	0	Yeah. How about we all give you a little makeover, Marjorine?	[]
Girls	4	0	Yeah. Let's go!	[]
Butters	3	0	You mean it?	[]
Kyle	9	0	Dude, it's been to long. Something's wrong.	[]
Stan	5	0	Maybe they found him out.	[]
Clyde	5	0	Then, he's already dead.	[]
Stan	8	0	Come on, we gotta go check on him.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Can you see anything?	[]
Stan	5	0	He's just dancing around.	[]
Cartman	5	1	That son of a bitch!	['bitch']
Mrs. Turner	8	0	Marjorine, sweetie your mom's on the phone.	[]
Butters	3	0	My mom?  Hello?	[]
Cartman	11	1	Butters! Just what the fuck do you think you're doing?!	['fuck']
Butters	10	0	Well, I'm just having some fun with my girlfriends.	[]
Cartman	20	1	You aren't there to have fun, you black asshole! You were supposed to be getting the future-telling device.	['asshole']
Butters	6	0	Well, I'm workin' on it.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Working on what?! Your dance moves?!	[]
Butters	27	0	Now look! I'm getting pretty sick of this! Well I put myself through a lot, and you can't talk to me like that! Uh... mom.	[]
Cartman	9	1	Just do what you were sent to do, dickface!	['dickface']
Red	7	0	Hey Marjorine, you wanna know your future?	[]
Butters	6	0	Ah. Uhh, could I hold that?	[]
Heidi	6	0	Sure.  Here, you do my future.	[]
Butters	1	0	How?	[]
Heidi	17	0	Well uh you know, it's easy. You just put your thumbs and index fingers in here...	[]
Mr. Turner	9	0	Aha! I knew it! Boys in the slumber party!	[]
Heidi	5	0	There's a boy here?	[]
Butters	19	0	Stand back! I had a... great time tonight, but I gotta do what I was sent here to do!	[]
Craig	7	0	He got it! He got the device!	[]
Cartman	16	0	Tango tango tango! We've got it! Let's get it to the containment center! Go!	[]
Stan	3	0	Come on, Butters.	[]
Butters	27	0	No! That darn device is nothin' but trouble! Ah I'm done, and I'm goin' home to tell my Mom and Dad I'm not dead!	[]
Heidi	3	1	What the hell?	['hell']
Cartman	11	0	Haahahaha, we have the device now! The power belongs to us!	[]
Heidi	13	0	...Anybody have a piece of notebook paper so I can make another one?	[]
Jason	7	0	Go! Go! Get in the containment field!	[]
Linda	4	0	Stephen, you did what??	[]
Stephen	29	0	I had to, Linda. If there was even the slightest chance it would bring him back! I don't know. I don't know what I'm doing anymore!	[]
Linda	13	0	You dug up our son's body? Performed some kind of pagan ritual?	[]
Stephen	15	0	Linda, I did it for you, you wanted him back so much! So did I!	[]
Linda	23	0	Not like this!  Not like this. He wouldn't be our son, Stephen. He would be a walking abomination. An unholy demon spawn!	[]
Butters	1	0	Hello?	[]
Stephen	3	0	It's him.	[]
Linda	4	0	Keep the door locked.	[]
Butters	10	0	Mom? Dad? Uh, it's me, Butters. I'm back.	[]
Linda	3	0	Oh God...  No!	[]
Stephen	9	0	It's gone, dear. It's gone. Forgive me.	[]
Butters	7	0	Hey Mom and Dad, I'm not-	[]
Stephen	9	0	Oh God, it's terrible. What have I done?!	[]
Butters	12	0	Uh, I guess you're probably a little surprised to see me.	[]
Linda	8	0	It isn't right! Make it go away!	[]
Cartman	22	0	Gentlemen, this is a historic day for all of the boy, and mankind. In a few moments, we will know the future.	[]
Stan	28	1	Ho-Hold on on guys. We're not sure what this device is capable of. Maybe we should wait until we've had more time to study it.	['ho']
Cartman	16	0	No, No! We don't have time for that, Stan. It's time to ask questions.	[]
Clyde	8	0	How come you get to use it first?	[]
Cartman	4	0	Because I do, Clyde.	[]
Craig	4	0	I wanna use it.	[]
Cartman	20	0	I'm askin' the first question! Let's just start with something simple. Will Kyle die before he's twenty?	[]
Kyle	7	0	Wait! I don't wanna know that!	[]
Clyde	9	0	Ask if the Broncos are gonna win on Sunday.	[]
Jason	10	0	Nah dude, then it won't be fun tow watch.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Will you all shut up so I can do this!?	[]
Craig	4	1	You shut up, asshole.	['asshole']
Kyle	12	0	I don't wanna know when I'm going to die, fatass!	[]
Stan	38	0	Guys, guys, guys, stop!  Look at what this thing is doing to us. Butters was trying to tell me something outside the house. That this device is nothing but trouble. I think I know what he meant now.	[]
Jason	6	0	How could be nothing but trouble?	[]
Stan	20	0	We risked everything to get it from the girls. How long before the girls attack us to get it back?	[]
Clyde	25	0	Yeah. Forget about the girls. What about if the CIA or, or the Russians know we have this? They'll come after us for sure.	[]
Craig	8	0	Maybe we should take it so someplace safer.	[]
Stan	30	0	And then what? Hide it forever from the government? From the... terrorists who want to use it for evil? Maybe... maybe nobody is meant to have this kind of power.	[]
Bradley	4	0	You mean destroy it?	[]
Cartman	10	1	Are you guys nuts?! After everything we've gone through!?	['nuts']
Stan	31	0	We got it away from the girls. That's what matters. But now the right thing to do isn't using it ourselves, then we're no better than they are.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Think of the power!	[]
Kyle	15	0	It's too much power. For anybody. Stan's right. It has to be destroyed.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Are we sure about this? We'll never know the future.	[]
Stan	14	0	Nobody will. That's the way it's suppose to be. Hit it, Kenny.	[]
Cartman	2	1	Damn, Ken.	['damn']
Stephen	13	0	Here. Here, you see? It's going to be all right. Hello... son.	[]
Butters	2	0	Hi Dad.	[]
Linda	6	0	He was supposed to stay dead!	[]
Butters	7	0	Mom, Dad, can I come upstairs now?	[]
Stephen	13	0	Sorry, son, but... you're a demon spawn now. You're an abomination.	[]
Butters	11	0	Can I have something to eat? Well, I'm pretty hungry.	[]
Linda	3	0	It's... hungry.	[]
Stephen	4	0	Yes, it must feed.	[]
Rachel	7	0	Hello, I'm Rachel with Quality Curtains.	[]
Stephen	6	0	Oh yes, thank you for coming.	[]
Rachel	6	0	Which room are we looking at?	[]
Stephen	6	1	Just follow me to the basement.	['basement']
Linda	3	1	Yes. The basement.	['basement']
Rachel	16	0	Oh my, it's pretty dark down here. You sure you need curtains?  Oh my God!	[]
Butters	5	0	Uh hello, I'm Butters.	[]
Rachel	7	0	Little boy, what are you doing here?	[]
Butters	1	0	Huh?	[]
Stephen	5	0	Here you go, son. Eat!	[]
Linda	4	0	What are we becoming?!	[]
Stephen	7	0	Come on. Don't watch it eat.	[]
Butters	8	0	Can I just have some Spaghetti-O's?	[]
