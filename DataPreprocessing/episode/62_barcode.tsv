Cartman	20	0	Yeah, but nobody told us how we had to do it. We can have Thanksgiving stuff and music numbers, too.	[]
Clyde	17	0	Well, we can add music numbers, but how do we make the Helen Keller story more Thanksgivingy?	[]
Wendy	14	0	I know! How about, instead of a dog, Helen Keller has a pet turkey.	[]
Token	7	0	Yeah, a turkey that could do tricks.	[]

Kyle	7	0	A smart one, that can do tricks.	[]
Rancher	21	0	Well, I ain't got a whole lot left, it bein' almost Thanksgiving and all.  Go ahead, just pick one out.	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmaay!	[]
Rancher	15	0	Oh, that one's a little messed up. Not exactly the... pick of the litter.	[]
Timmy	1	0	Haaaaa!	[]
Kyle	17	0	Uh, Timmy, if we back to the other kids with that turkey they're gonna be pissed!	[]
Timmy	1	0	TIMMAY!	[]
Rancher	25	0	Yeah. Best you not take that one. I was just about to take it out in the yard and putt a bullet in its head.	[]
Kyle	7	0	What?! Aw, dude, don't say that!	[]
Timmy	3	0	T-TIIMMAY TIMMAY!	[]
Kyle	7	0	Alright, we'll take him. How much?	[]
Rancher	2	0	Fifty bucks.	[]
Kyle	18	0	But you were just gonna take it out in the backyard and put a bullet in its head!	[]
Rancher	10	0	I know! Now I gotta find somethin' else to shoot.	[]
Kyle	8	1	...God-damnit, here!  Alright, Timmy, let's go!	['damnit']

Kyle	6	1	Aw, blow it out your ass!	['ass']
Cartman	35	0	Guys, I want you all to meet Jeffrey Maynard. He's South Park's biggest expert on musical theater, AND, he played the lead in Les Miserables at the Denver Community Playhouse for five weeks.	[]
Kids	1	0	Bravo.	[]
Wendy	14	0	Do you think we could make up a good Thanksgiving play in four days?	[]
Jeffrey Maynard	13	0	I would swear it on my life. Your play shall want for nothing.	[]
Kids	1	0	Hooray!	[]
Jeffrey Maynard	20	0	Now, the first thing a good musical needs is a big opening number. Something that sets up the entire show.	[]
Cartman	12	1	Alright! Places, everybody! Bring in the turkey!  What the hell is that?	['hell']
Kyle	8	0	It's a turkey.  His name is Gobbles.	[]
Timmy	1	0	GOBBLES!	[]
Cartman	9	0	And where... pray... is our beautiful trick performing turkey?	[]
Kyle	11	0	Um, we... sssort of spend all the money on this... one...	[]
Timmy	1	0	GOBBLES!	[]
Cartman	20	0	Kyle, can I talk to you over here for a second?  Kyle? Why do you do these things to me?	[]
Kyle	25	0	I didn't do anything to you. Timmy saw the turkey and wanted to get it. What do you want me to say to him?	[]
Cartman	12	0	You say, No, Timmy, you can't have that turkey! Bad Timmy!	[]
Kyle	16	0	Look, I know it isn't exactly what we wanted, but maybe we can train it.	[]
Token	4	0	Yeah, that turkey sucks.	[]
Jeffrey Maynard	18	0	Wait! What's that, you say? A thanksgiving turkey is what you require? I know of a turkey.	[]
Stan	2	0	You do?	[]
Jeffrey Maynard	25	0	During my years on Broadway I... worked with a turkey who could do all kinds of tricks. She even jumped through a hoop of fire.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Cool! Can you get it for us?	[]
Jeffrey Maynard	18	0	I will go promptly and call her trainer. On the morrow you shall have your trick performing turkey.	[]
Kids	1	0	Alright!	[]
Timmy	9	0	Gobbles!  Gobbles!  Up, heh. Uh!  Heeey, Gobbles!  Gobbles.  Gobbles!	[]
Cartman	2	0	No no!	[]
Liane	11	0	Boopsie-kins, It's late. You need to be in bed.	[]
Cartman	21	0	I can't sleep, Mom! I have to write the lyrics for the opening song of our Helen Keller Thanksgiving spectacular!	[]
Liane	2	0	Now, hon!	[]
Cartman	23	0	But  Mo-o-om, I have to write these lyrics so the plight of Helen Keller can be realized by the common man.	[]
Liane	7	0	Twenty more minutes, and that's it.	[]
Cartman	39	1	Twenty minutes! Does Tim Rice's mom give him twenty minutes to write the lyrics to Phantom Of The Opera?!  Speak to me Helen. Let me be your voice.  Come on, you blind bitch! Channel your spirit through me!	['bitch']
Clyde	14	0	Tonight we present the story of a courageous girl and her fight against depression	[]
Cartman	2	0	OP-pression!	[]
Clyde	13	0	Oppression. Our play begins in a simpler time.  Alabama, in the late 1800s	[]
Actors	29	0	\ 1800's, Alabama! What a great place and time! We're so happy that we live in 1800's Alabama 'cause it's sunny and there is no crime!	[]
Jeffrey	4	0	Now to the refrain!	[]
Actors	37	0	And in this little town in 1800's Alabama there's a family by the name of Keller! Their daughter's deaf and mute and blind as a bat, and her parents can't even tell her!!	[]
Lamond	8	0	Excuse me, I am Lamond, the animal trainer.	[]
Clyde	5	0	Oh.  Cool! He's here!	[]
Cartman	10	0	Awesome! Do you have a turkey that can do tricks?	[]
Lamond	51	0	Ap ap! Do not call them tricks! She's a very sensitive turkey! She performs feats, not tricks. Ladies and gentlemen, may I present the most beautiful bird in America!  Four-time prize winner of the National Western Stock Show and reigning poster child of turkeylovers.com! I give you Alinicia!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Yeh.	[]
Others	1	0	Wow.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Whoa.	[]
Bebe	4	0	Her feathers are beautiful.	[]
Clyde	8	0	That's the prettiest turkey I ever saw.	[]
Lamond	4	0	Of course she is!	[]
Cartman	16	1	Okay! Now we can really get this thing underway! Places, everybody!  Where the hell is Timmy?	['hell']
Timmy	2	0	TIM-MIH!	[]
Lamond	3	0	What... is... that?!	[]
Cartman	8	0	Uh, that's Gobbles, the physically challenged turkey.	[]
Timmy	2	0	Gobbles!  Gobbles?!	[]
Kyle	6	0	Timmy, we already got a turkey.	[]
Clyde	6	0	Yeah, and it's from Broadway.	[]
Timmy	1	0	Gobbles.	[]
Cartman	11	0	No, Timmy! That handicapped turkey does not go in our play!	[]
Kyle	19	0	Dude, don't forget: Timmy is the only kid who can play Helen Keller. Don't piss him off.	[]
Cartman	9	0	No, that's right. Only Timmy knows the part.	[]
Timmy	2	0	Tim-mih.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Oh, Jesus! Okay, fine! Helen Keller can have TWO pet turkeys!	[]
Lamond	8	0	My turkey does not work with other turkeys!	[]
Cartman	9	1	Oh, God-damnit, now what are we gonna do?!	['damnit']
Lamond	9	0	Alright, ah ah alright! Alri- ah a-alright. Alright.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Dude, we need your turkey for our play!	[]
Lamond	16	0	She's not coming out. She's very upset! She's pooped all over the room!	[]
Cartman	52	1	I know, I know, but listen: Uh, let me try to explain the position I'm in here. The retarded turkey belongs to our friend, Timmy. And Timmy's the only person who knows the part of Helen Keller. So, so tell me what I can do here to make everybody happy?	['retarded']
Lamond	4	0	Kill the other turkey!	[]
Cartman	10	1	I can't dude. Timmy has a boner for it.	['boner']
Lamond	8	0	Well, it could meet with an unfortunate accident.	[]
Cartman	13	0	Unfortunate accident? You mean, like Geena Davis getting her own TV show?  Oh.	[]
Lamond	27	0	It's very simple! Either that turkey meets with an unfortunate accident, or you don't have a feat-performing turkey for your Helen Keller Thanksgiving musical!	[]
Cartman	25	1	Alright, alright! Just get your turkey to stop crapping all over the dressing room and come out for rehearsal! I'll take care of everything.	['crapping']
Bebe	12	0	Water, Helen. It has a name. Oh, why can't you understand?	[]
Timmy	2	0	Dehh haaa.	[]
Bebe	3	0	Water, Helen, Water.	[]
Kids	15	0	She's never gonna do it. There's no way she'll ever do it.	[]
Bebe	4	0	Helen, Helen. Water, Helen.	[]
Kids	13	0	How can she talk if she can't hear? This is absolutely pointless!	[]
Cartman	69	0	Okay, uh, hold it. Uh, let's hold it right there a second.  Okay, I just want to adjust the blocking real quick. Hm-let's see. Uh, why don't we have Turkey #2  stand just a little bit more over...  here.  Let's see, maybe a little more up in here.  And just a wee bit over here.  And right about...  hm'ere.  There we go. Good.	[]
Stan	7	0	Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!	[]
Jeffrey	2	0	Whoa-aaaa	[]
Cartman	9	1	Aw, crap! I must've rigged the wrong light!	['crap']
Jeffrey	12	0	Let him rest in peace. Let him rest. Why must he die?	[]
Butters	5	0	They've got special effects!	[]
Kyle	2	0	What Butters?	[]
Butters	22	0	The kindergartners! They've got amazing stage effects. Pyrotechnics and what have yous. Why, it's a regular feast for the eyes!	[]
Wendy	2	0	Oh, no!	[]
Clyde	7	0	We're never gonna outdo them now!	[]
Token	6	0	But what are we gonna do?	[]
Cartman	33	0	Calm down! Calm down! We can have special effects, too. Now, I know a lot is going wrong, but we've got to stick together to make this play work!  All of us!	[]
Jeffrey	7	0	-and into your hands  uh he... buh...	[]
Timmy	4	0	Gobbles!  Hu-ugh, Gobbles!	[]
Lamond	2	0	Little boy.	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmy.	[]
Lamond	32	0	Yes, Tim. I feel I must speak with you.  The others, well, they don't want you to know, but, oh, I don't know what to do. Should I tell you?	[]
Timmy	2	0	T-Timmih?	[]
Lamond	27	0	I feel I'm the only one who can be honest with you.  The animal shelter is on its way to...take your turkey away from you.	[]
Timmy	1	0	Gobbles?	[]
Lamond	35	0	You see, they don't allow children in your... situation... to have wild animals as pets. You can't take him running, you can't take care of him. They... have to take it away.	[]
Timmy	1	0	Gobbles!	[]
Lamond	80	0	They take wild pets away from people like you... and hand them over for experiments. And they're shocked, dissected, and flayed while they're still alive. And no matter where you go, the shelter people will find you. The only way for that turkey to avoid years of torture is for you to... let him go. Back into the wild.  Oh no! Here they come now!  Quick, go! And set your turkey free! I'll try to stall them.	[]
Timmy	3	0	T-tim-mih.	[]
Installer	14	0	Eh, excuse me, we're here to install the water effects for the musical?	[]
Lamond	7	0	Uh, the stage is right through there.	[]
Installer	1	0	Thanks.	[]
Cartman	14	1	Alright, got to write the new lyrics. Lemme see.  no  No.  NO!  God-damnit	['damnit']
Jeffrey	5	0	How is it going, Eric?	[]
Cartman	16	0	Terrible!  I can't write the lyrics for the third act! Nothing's coming to me.	[]
Jeffrey	16	0	Well, you know in theater sometimes, we try different tricks to get the creative juices flowing.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Like what?	[]
Jeffrey	30	0	Let's see.  Helen Keller was blind and deaf.  Perhaps you should see what it is like. Deprive yourself of your senses and see what plays inside your mind. Here.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Hey, that's not a bad idea.	[]
Jeffrey	14	0	Just relax. Just try to let your mind wander and let the juices flow...	[]
Cartman	2	0	Oh, man!	[]
Jeffrey	5	0	Well, did you see anything?	[]
Cartman	14	1	No, just the same old crap I always see when I close my eyes.	['crap']
Jeffrey	5	0	...Oh, that's too bad.	[]
Cartman	27	0	Wait. I've got it! The perfect setup for when Helen Keller's pet turkey jumps through the hoop of fire!  Yes! Yes! I have it now!	[]
Lamond	24	0	The only way for that turkey to avoid years of torture is for you to... let him go...  let him go... let him go...	[]
Timmy	7	0	Gobbles!  Gobbles!!  Gobbles. Gobbles!  Timmih.  Timmih, Gobbles.	[]
Boy	9	0	Daddy, why did Mommy leave and go to heaven?	[]
Father	10	0	She didn't want to, Kevin. She... had no choice.	[]
Boy	4	0	But I miss her.	[]
Elderly man	28	0	I could have so much more with my life, son. I've wasted it. I've wasted it, not ever telling you and Mark that I love you.	[]
Girl	3	0	Robby! Robby, no!	[]
Woman	16	0	...Because now, every time I look at you , I see her!  I have to move on.	[]
Man	9	0	Kelly, please. Don't do this. I'm sorry.	[]
Kelly	6	0	Then why did you do it??	[]
Man	4	0	I don't know!	[]
Lady	9	0	Have you done the right things in your life?	[]
Sharon	2	0	Hi, Sheila.	[]
Sheila	6	0	Hello, Sharon. Where's your husband?	[]
Sharon	18	0	Oh, he's in the back. He set up a video camera so he can tape the performance.	[]
Sheila	4	0	Oh, so did Gerald.	[]
Gerald	8	0	Oh yeah, I got a great angle here.	[]
Randy	19	0	Ey, Gerald, maybe after the show we can make copies of each other's tape so we have both.	[]
Gerald	2	0	Good idea.	[]
Kyle	13	0	So wait. Do we do that spin-around thing on the last beat?	[]
Stan	9	0	No, it's on the 'en or the 'ay.	[]
Kyle	7	0	You ready for the big show, Timmy?	[]
Stan	4	0	Where's Gobbles, Timmy?	[]
Timmy	1	0	Gobbles.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Alright everybody, let's take our places!	[]
Kyle	6	0	Cartman, where's Timmy's turkey?	[]
Cartman	36	1	I don't know.  I don't know, you guys! Alright, maybe I tried to have Timmy's turkey crushed by a stage light, but I didn't do anything else. I'm not an asshole.	['asshole']
Lamond	24	1	You're going to be brilliant, you sexy, gorgeous turkey. With that other meddling animal out of the way, you'll steal the show!	['sexy']
Driver	15	0	Well, well, what are doing out here?  You shouldn't be out walking the streets.	[]

Cartman	13	0	Hey, the fountains you guys installed are shorting out some of our lights.	[]
Installer	22	0	Look, we're only here to do the water effects. We're not in charge of electrical. That's a different union.	[]
