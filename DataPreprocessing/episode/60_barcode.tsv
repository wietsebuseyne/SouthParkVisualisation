Stan	11	0	Well, here we are, dude, the first day of fourth grade.	[]
Kyle	9	0	Yeah. No more getting pushed around by fourth graders!	[]
Kyle	7	0	Hey! We're fourth-graders now, too!	[]
Kyle	3	1	Ungh, gay, dude.	['gay']
Stan	13	0	Dude, we gotta find some third-graders to beat up.  Hey, come here	[]
Younger Boy	1	0	What?	[]
Stan	6	0	What grade are you going into?	[]
Younger Boy	2	0	Thi-ird	[]
Stan	3	0	Stupid third grader!	[]
Cartman	5	0	Yeah,  get out of here!	[]
Younger Boy	1	0	Uhuhuhow.	[]
Cartman	4	0	There, that's better.	[]
Kyle	14	0	You know, I heard our fourth-grade teacher is some new lady from Denver.	[]
Stan	1	0	Denver?	[]
Cartman	9	0	U-hoh, dude, we could walk all over her.	[]
Kyle	23	0	He's right. We have to take a hard stance right now and establish that we're the dominant ones in this relationship!	[]
Stan	23	0	Alright.  Hey, listen up everybody!  We need to stand up to this new teacher and insert ourselves! Let's all do something radical!	[]
Clyde	2	0	Like what?	[]
Stan	27	1	Like... ah, how about right at 8:35 we all jump up on our desks and pull down our pants and shout, KISS MY ASS!!! all together!	['ass']
The Kids	1	0	YEAH!!!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Why, that's PERfect!	[]
Butters	28	1	Well, buh wuh when we pull our pants down,  should we stand frontways or back? I mean, do we show 'er our... behinds, or-ar our w-wieners?	['wieners']
Stan	11	1	...I think showing her our asses should be quite sufficient, Butters.	['asses']
Butters	27	1	Uh-uh, maybe we could stand like this , with our wieners pokin' through the back of our legs, you know, and give 'er a nice fruit bowl.	['wieners']
Kyle	8	1	...Yeah. Or we could just show our asses.	['asses']
Stan	27	1	Okay, so it's decided. When the clock hits 8:35 we all stand up on our desks, pull down our pants and yell, KISS MY ASS!!!	['ass']
Kyle	4	0	Together we are strong!	[]
The Kids	1	0	YEAH!!!	[]
Clyde	10	0	Hey, Timmy might need some help pulling his pants down.	[]
Stan	5	0	We got you covered, Timmy.	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmay!	[]
Kyle	7	0	Whoa, dude, this is our new classroom?	[]
Butters	6	0	Huhuh, look at all this stuff.	[]
Cartman	10	1	Hey, what the hell is with these little half-desks?	['hell']
Stan	13	0	Dude, look at the walls.  Everything is written in some strange, foreign language.	[]
New Teacher	9	0	Alright, children, quiet down. Welcome to the fourth grade.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Holy God, dude!	[]
Kenny	5	2	(Those titties are fuckin' huge!)	['titties', 'fuckin']
New Teacher	5	0	My name is Ms. Choksondik.	[]
Stan	4	0	...More like, Ms. Makesmesick.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Ms. Choksondik	32	0	Play time is over, children! Do you understand me?!  I don't know how your last teacher behaved, but this is the fourth grade!  And it is time to go to work!	[]
Cartman	9	1	KISS MY ASS!!!  Oh, weak, you guys. Seriously weak.	['ass']
Ms. Choksondik	12	0	Well, young man, I hope you have a good explanation for this.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Oh, I'm sure I do.	[]
Ms. Choksondik	10	0	This is the fourth grade! You need to grow up!	[]
Cartman	3	0	I'm trying.	[]
Ms. Choksondik	22	0	Now, get back to your desk and write a thousand-word essay on why you feel you need to disrupt my class.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Fantastic, then.	[]
Ms. Choksondik	9	0	Now, let us begin our first-day exam.  SILENCE!	[]
Stan	3	1	What a bitch!	['bitch']
Kyle	17	0	And did you see her lazy eye? You can't even tell what she's looking at.	[]
Cartman	6	0	You guys are all such pussies!	[]
Tweek	16	0	I can't take it, man! Writing in cursive?? Fractions?? I can't do i-it!	[]
Stan	21	0	This is it. The end of innocence.  This is the loss of that playful youth all our parents told us about.	[]
Kyle	10	0	I just didn't think it would come so soon.	[]
Cartman	16	0	Yeah. Only now do we realize how much we all took the third grade for granted.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Huh?	[]
Cartman	145	0	Everything was great in third grade. And now that it's all over, we're starting to see just how special it was. Remember how it used to be in the Third Grade? We used to laugh and play and cherish each day in the Third Grade We learned wondrous things from a teacher so nice Sat on marshmallow desks with teddy-bear smiles The world seemed to all make sense but that sense seems to slowly fade After Third Grade In the Third Grade we used to write with crayons We would make sparkly pictures with glitter and glue We had warm cookies and hearts full of love And there wasn't a care in the world of me... of you... There's not a thing in this life that I wouldn't trade just to go back, for one minute To Third Grade	[]
Kyle	10	0	Wow! I had already forgotten how great third grade was.	[]
Butters	4	0	Huh-it sure was.	[]
Cartman	6	0	I wish I was still there.	[]
Stan	11	0	Hey, that's it! We gotta go back to third grade!	[]
Kyle	1	0	How?	[]
Stan	5	0	We travel back in time.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Oh yeah, time travel.	[]
Butters	27	0	Oowuh how are we gonna do that? Does it hurt?  I don't wanna do it if it hurts. Or if it... makes you get all sticky.	[]
Stan	14	0	It can't be that bad. People do it on TV all the time.	[]
Cartman	13	0	Yeah, we just have to find somebody who knows how to do it.	[]
Kyle	20	1	Well, what about those two college guys next door to me? They're always doing science experiments in their basement.	['basement']
Cartman	17	0	Yeah, if there's a way to travel back in time, those two dorks will know how!	[]
Nerd #1	55	0	When it comes to time-traveling theory, there are basically two school of thought. The Spock Theory is that a sling shot around the sun could create a wormhole in which time could not escape. The Lieutenant Commander Data Theory, however, is that a nag vibration could create a rip in the time-space continuum-	[]
Cartman	13	0	Look, whatever it takes, we just have to get back to third grade.	[]
Nerd #2	24	0	Time-travel is no laughing matter. Four times the Enterprise went back in time, and four times they almost didn't make it back.	[]
Stan	13	0	We don't want to make it back, we want to stay there.	[]
Nerd #1	1	0	Oh.	[]
Kyle	5	0	So can you do it?	[]
Nerd #2	27	0	It's all theoretical, but from a scientific standpoint, the creation of a rip in space-time is possible. We just need to find an inertia device.	[]
Nerd #1	12	0	Heeeyyy.  This kid's electric wheelchair might be just what we need.	[]
Timmy	2	0	Tuh-timmih?	[]
Principal Victoria	10	1	Oh, this new fourth-grade teacher is driving me nuts!	['nuts']
Chef	4	0	What's the problem?	[]
Mr. Mackey	21	0	Uh, you see, Chef, Ms. Choksondik has very large, uh, honkers, and she doesn't seem to like wearing a bra.	[]
Chef	11	0	You call that a problem? That sounds like heaven to me.	[]
Mr. Mackey	14	0	No, it's really not as nice as you might imagine, Chef, m'kay.	[]
Ms. Choksondik	7	0	Principal Victoria, I would like a word!	[]
Chef	4	0	Oooo! Call the doctor!	[]
Ms. Choksondik	18	0	My new students are the most misbehaved, illiterate, brain-dead group of children I have ever come across!	[]
Principal Victoria	12	0	Well, Miss... Choksondik, those children did fairly well in the third grade.	[]
Ms. Choksondik	10	0	One of them is mentally handicapped, for Christ's sake!	[]
Principal Victoria	3	0	Oh? Which one?	[]
Ms. Choksondik	26	0	The one in the wheelchair! Look, I would like to have a talk with their last year's teacher! Who was it? Mr. Uh-heh, Garrison?!	[]
Principal Victoria	17	0	I'm afraid that's impossible. Nobody's seen Mr. Garrison since the last school year ended.	[]
Ms. Choksondik	5	0	Why?! Where did he go?!	[]
Mr. Mackey	8	0	We... don't like to talk about it.	[]
Ms. Choksondik	22	0	But I need help reaching these kids! I have nothing but the highest expectations for them. And with  God as my witness-	[]
The Adults	2	0	Aww Oooo!	[]
Ms. Choksondik	46	0	I'm going to teach these kids the wonders of the world, so that they can reach the top!  I hope that sometime very soon you will let me in on what happened to this Mr. Garrison! And with that I will bid you good day!	[]
Principal Victoria	7	0	Wuh sure thing, fine, bye-bye then.	[]
Nerd #1	29	0	Alright, when we power up, the handicapped kid's chair will accelerate at a high rate of speed about 10 feet that way , then make the required magnetic vibrations.	[]
Nerd #2	18	0	If the fields are right, it should then create a wormhole up near the front of the classroom.	[]
Wendy	13	0	You guys don't actually think this is going to work, do you?	[]
Nerd #1	22	0	Now, eh, when you all see a wormhole, yuh-you guys are gonna have about 4.2 seconds to run through it.	[]
Nerd #2	18	0	And on the other side you will find yourself in exactly the same spot, only one year ago.	[]
Stan	5	0	Back in the third grade.	[]
Kids	2	0	Cool/Wow.	[]
Kyle	21	1	I can't wait until the teacher yells at us this time, and we all tell her to suck our balls!	['balls']
Kids	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Stan	4	0	Oh! Here she comes.	[]
Ms. Choksondik	19	0	Alright, children, I hope you all did your homework last night. Please pass your papers up to the frontuh.	[]
Cartman	12	2	Suck my balls!!!  Oh, God-damnit, you guys, I am so seriously-	['balls', 'damnit']
Ms. Choksondik	8	0	I said, pass your papers to the fronteh!	[]
Cartman	14	0	We didn't do our homework, Ms. Makesmesick! We didn't feel like it!	[]
Ms. Choksondik	11	0	It's Choksondik! And you are all going to have detention!	[]
Cartman	13	0	Hahaa! Charade you are, teacher! I'm afraid we have different plans! Gentlemen?	[]
Nerd #1	3	0	Primary fusion initiated.	[]
Nerd #2	3	0	Molecular grenadine active.	[]
Timmy	3	0	Aa-aa-ah!	[]
Ms. Choksondik	4	0	What are you doing?!	[]
Cartman	20	0	We're going back in time to third grade! Goodbye, teacher! Perhaps we shall see you in another year! Hahaaa!	[]
Timmy	2	0	Timmaaaaaaaaah!  Timmaaaaaaaaah!	[]
Nerd #1	7	0	I didn't think it would work.	[]
Nerd #2	2	0	Me neither.	[]
Ms. Choksondik	12	0	Well, well, well! I'd say somebody has some explaining to do!	[]
Cartman	6	1	You're damn right they do!	['damn']
Kyle	15	0	Dude! Timmy's chair is packed with all that stuff! We've gotta help him!	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Come on!	[]
Ms. Choksondik	5	0	Children! Children, come back here!	[]
Stan	5	0	Timmy, you have to stop!	[]
Nerd #1	1	0	No!	[]
Stan	1	0	No??	[]
Nerd #1	23	0	Look, the system malfunctions if he stops. The nuclear core can bake his magnetic field and the whole chair will blow sky-high.	[]
Kyle	10	0	What?! Timmy! You've got to get off that chair!	[]
Nerd #1	1	0	No!	[]
Kyle	1	0	No??	[]
Nerd #2	19	0	We've rigged the chair to be sensitive to his weight. If he gets off, the whole thing blows!	[]
Stan	22	0	So if Timmy drops his speed below five miles an hour the chair blow, and if he gets off, the chair blows?	[]
The Nerds	1	0	Yup.	[]
Stan	2	0	My God!	[]
Anchor Tom	24	0	It's been over three hours since the police first showed up on the scene of a handicapped boy's wheelchair set with explosives.	[]
Stan	4	0	Over here, over here!	[]
Anchor Tom	25	0	The child can't stop or get off the chair without risking explosion, and so the SWAT team will now attempt to disarm the device.	[]
Timmy	3	0	Timmi-hih-ih!	[]
SWAT Hansen	12	0	Closer!  Don't worry, son. Just watch your speed and stay still!	[]
Pilot	3	0	Look out, Hansen!	[]
SWAT rescuer Hansen	1	0	Oh!	[]
Brunette	1	0	Aaaah!	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmaaay!	[]
Hansen	5	0	Dear Jesus! Hang on, lady!	[]
Brunette	7	0	Oh my God, what's going on?	[]
Hansen	11	0	Ma'am, be very careful! That wheelchair is set to explode!	[]
Brunette	4	0	What?!  AAAH!! Omigod! Omigod!	[]
Hansen	12	0	It's okay! Just stay calm and keep the speed above 5!	[]
Brunette	5	0	O-kay. O-kay. Omigod.	[]
Timmy	2	0	Tih-Timmah?	[]
Brunette	7	0	Okay. I kept the speed at 5.	[]
Hansen	9	0	Good! What's the wheelchair's battery power at?	[]
Brunette	7	0	Oh my God! Less than 20 minutes!	[]
Stan	4	0	Less than 20 minutes?!	[]
Kyle	6	0	Oh no! What have we done?!	[]
Principal Victoria	4	0	Whattaya think? Too forward?	[]
Ms. Choksondik	4	0	I HAVE HAD IT!!!	[]
Principal Victoria	1	0	Waaah!	[]
Ms. Choksondik	17	0	These children are out of control! I must speak with their last year's teacher, Mr. Garrison!	[]
Principal Victoria	7	0	As we said before, that's impossible.	[]
Ms. Choksondik	8	0	What in God's name happened to him?	[]
Chef	32	4	Uuuh, Ms. Choksondik, Mr. Garrison had several uuh, eee-motional issues. He was a closet homosexual who hated gay people. Whenever someone asked him if he was gay, he'd go nuts.	['homosexual', 'gay', 'gay', 'nuts']
Principal Victoria	14	1	And then he was accused of trying to solicit sex from a young boy.	['sex']
Mr. Mackey	43	2	After being dismissed from teaching, he went off to write romance novels. His first novel sold well and everything was fine until he found out that his novel won the gay Pulitzer Prize, and was considered the best homoerotic novel since Huckleberry Finn.	['gay', 'homoerotic']
Principal Victoria	18	0	He finally snapped and had a nervous breakdown and... went up into the mountains to live in solitude.	[]
Chef	20	0	Some say that on cold nights you can still hear him moanin', I'm not gaaay! I'm not gaaay!	[]
Mr. Garrison	4	0	Iii'mmm nnnooottt gggaaayyy!!!	[]
Ms. Choksondik	5	0	And, nobody has found him?	[]
Mr. Mackey	7	0	Well, we really haven't ll-looked.	[]
Ms. Choksondik	27	0	I see.  Then the only way I'll find the secret to teaching these kids is to go up into those mountains and find Mr. Garrison myself!	[]
Principal Victoria	10	0	But he could be anywhere up high in those mountains.	[]
Ms. Choksondik	16	0	Oh, I'll find him! Even if I have to climb up  and up  and up!	[]
"Chef, Victoria, Mackey"	1	0	NOOO!!	[]
Ms. Choksondik	1	0	What?	[]
Brunette	6	0	Oh my God, Oh my God!	[]
Field Reporter	39	0	Tom, I'm standing about two miles outside of Denver where the darling handicapped boy fights for his life on a wheelchair of death.  Guys, can you tell us what kind of explosive we're actually dealing with here.	[]
Nerd #1	13	0	Uh, well, it's a simple hydrogen-fusion core with a veltig reactant-	[]
Timmy	3	0	Ah, please help!	[]
Nerd #2	7	0	Which just turned into a time bomb.	[]
Timmy	2	0	Please help.	[]
Nerd #1	12	0	This has never happened in all the 72 original Star Trek episodes.	[]
Nerd #2	6	0	Yah... wait, you mean 73 episodes.	[]
Nerd #1	4	0	...No, there were 72.	[]
Nerd #2	4	0	No there weren't!	[]
Nerd #1	6	0	Oh, you are such a nerd!	[]
Field Reporter	33	0	Tom, I understand that now, the rescuers are gonna try and send in one of the handicapped boy's little friends, in an attempt to keep him calm and hopefully, disarm the device.	[]
Hansen	9	0	It's alright, everything's goin' tuh be fine.	[]
Brunette	3	0	Oh my God!	[]
Hansen	32	0	Alright, young man, when you get underneath that wheelchair, I want you to relay back to me with this walkie-talkie, and then I'll tell you which wires to cross. Ready?	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Yes, sir!)	[]
Hansen	2	0	Go below!	[]
Kenny	11	0	(Hi guys.)  (Uh oh.)  (Uff. I'm okay.)  (I'm oKAAAYYYYYYY!!!)	[]
Stan	7	0	Well, who didn't see that coming?	[]
Brunette	6	0	Oh my God! Oh my God!	[]
Hansen	7	0	Stay calm! You have to stay calm!	[]
Brunette	10	0	But if we got off the chair it blows up!	[]
Hansen	10	0	No no, that's only if the boy gets off.	[]
Brunette	3	0	Oh.  See ya!	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmih!	[]
Pilot	3	0	Ten seconds, Hansen!	[]
Stan	2	0	...nine, eight...	[]
Timmy	4	0	Please-a help me.	[]
Pilot	2	0	...six, five...	[]
Timmy	6	0	Please help me. Please help me.	[]
Hansen	6	0	Got it! I think! Up, up!	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmay!	[]
Nerd #1	4	0	Hey, it did work.	[]
Ms. Choksondik	20	0	Hello-oo-ooo.  Oh, what am I doing? I'm gonna get myself killed.  Is anyone here?  Mister? Mr. Garrison?	[]
Mr. Garrison	8	0	Who-? Who are you? What do you want?	[]
Ms. Choksondik	38	0	I am the new fourth grade teacher. I've come to... seek your help.  Please. I don't know how to handle the new fourth graders. I've tried everything. I need to know how you taught them.	[]
Mr. Garrison	10	0	No! No, I... haven't... taught in over... eight... months.	[]
Ms. Choksondik	14	0	Mr. Garrison, you knew how to reach these kids! You're my only hope!	[]
Mr. Garrison	11	0	Do you know what it is to be a teacher, Ms....?	[]
Ms. Choksondik	1	0	Choksondik.	[]
Mr. Garrison	41	1	No I don't!  IT'S A LIE! You see? That's what you get for bein' a teacher! You work and you work for the children and then people start rumors that you're gay even though you love poontang!	['gay']
Ms. Choksondik	32	0	Mr. Garrison, these children are depending on me to give them a future. I can't do it without your guidance. Please! Help me, for them! For the future of our children!	[]
Mr. Garrison	3	0	...Two hundred bucks.	[]
Ms. Choksondik	1	0	...Done.	[]
Stan	8	0	Dude! You gotta build us another time machine!	[]
Nerd #1	4	0	Huh? Oh... Can't.	[]
Kyle	15	0	What do you mean, can't?! You made it work; just build us another one!	[]
Nerd #1	28	0	I can't, because pizza-face isn't here! We're not on speaking terms! We got in a big fight and he moved all his stuff out!	[]
Stan	9	0	W-what did you get in a fight about?	[]
Nerd #1	12	0	There's 73 original Star Treks! He keeps saying there's 72!	[]
Stan	10	0	Oh, Jesus Christ! You've got to be kidding me!	[]
Nerd #1	7	0	No! He actually thinks there's 72.!	[]
Cartman	12	0	Look, dude, can't you just build us another machine without him?	[]
Nerd #1	28	0	No. Pizza-face took all his equipment home to his mom's. Now, if you can go over there and get him to admit that he's wrong...	[]
Stan	21	0	Alright, come on, guys.  Man, I can't believe we have to do this while Timmy's already back in time!	[]
Kyle	13	0	Yeah! Timmy's probably back in third grade right now living it up!	[]
Timmy	2	0	Timmah! Timmaaaaahhh!	[]
Mr. Garrison	6	0	Alright, let's try it again.	[]
Ms. Choksondik	9	0	Children, we are now going to do math problems.	[]
Mr. Garrison	11	0	But teacher, I don't want to do my math problems.	[]
Ms. Choksondik	15	0	Uuh! Ah, you will do them or else you'll be in very big trouble!	[]
Mr. Garrison	15	1	Well, I'm not gong' to do it, teacher! You can just suck my balls!	['balls']
Ms. Choksondik	9	0	Don't use that kind of language, young man!	[]
Mr. Garrison	1	0	NOOO!	[]
Ms. Choksondik	1	0	No??	[]
Mr. Garrison	31	1	Look, you can't counter a profane command with an idle threat! You must extinguish it with a vulgar suggestion! When a child says, Suck my balls, you say, Present them.	['balls']
Ms. Choksondik	1	0	Oh.	[]
Mr. Garrison	9	1	Now, let's try it again.  SUCK MY BALLS!	['balls']
Ms. Choksondik	3	0	Pre-sent them?	[]
Mr. Garrison	41	0	Good.  Very good.  You're ready to move on to the next level. But I warn you: we will now be diving deep into your own psyche. These children know what scares you, and so we, too, must face those demons.	[]
Ms. Choksondik	7	0	I'm ready. I'm not afraid.	[]
Mr. Garrison	9	0	You will be! You will be!  You will be.	[]
Stan	5	1	God-damnit, this is ridiculous.	['damnit']
Nerd #2	1	0	What?!	[]
Stan	25	0	Dude, can you please just stop fighting with your friend and build another machine so we can travel back in time to the third grade?	[]
Nerd #2	27	0	Look! There aren't 73 episodes of Star Trek, there are 72! The Menagerie was a 2-parter that counts as one episode! Pizza-face is wrong!	[]
Cartman	4	1	Who the hell cares?!	['hell']
Nerd #2	13	1	I know! Why does he have to be such a dick about it?!	['dick']
Kyle	15	0	Wouldn't it be better to just agree with him and forget the whole thing?	[]
Nerd #2	5	0	No, because he's WRONG!	[]
Kyle	32	0	Look. You guys built a machine together that can bend time. If you'll just agree with him, you can build another one and usher in a whole new era of science!	[]
Nerd #2	24	0	And live in a world of 72 original Star Treks? I don't think so! I don't want to live in that world.	[]
Cartman	7	1	God, these guys are such geek dumbasses!	['dumbasses']
Stan	2	0	I know.	[]
Butters	33	1	Yeh-hah. They don't even realize that The Menagerie originally was the pilot and later got split up into two episodes, eh ha ha. Ha ha.  Hahahaha, eh the, eh the dumbasses.	['dumbasses']
Stan	7	0	Wait a minute! I've got it.	[]
Nerd #2	1	0	What?!	[]
Stan	26	0	Dude, if you guys build another time machine, you can travel back in time and ask the creator of Star Trek how many episodes there were!	[]
Nerd #2	5	0	Dude, Jesus, you're right.	[]
Mr. Garrison	16	0	This is it: The Tree of Insight. You must go in and face what lives inside.	[]
Ms. Choksondik	3	0	What lives inside?	[]
Mr. Garrison	10	1	Hell if I know. I wouldn't go in there.	['hell']
Ms. Choksondik	72	0	Oh, alrighty.  What the? Why there's nothing in here but an exit to the other side!  There's nothing in here at all. ...Oh, and I actually thought my mental demons would be in here.  Wait a minute. Maybe there's not supposed to be anything in here. Maybe I'm supposed to see that I alone do have the strength to reach the kids!  I think I get it now!	[]
Mr. Garrison	34	2	Hey, hurry up in there!  Jesus.  You're taking too long in the damn Tree of Insight!  You in there?!  Hey, where the hell did she go?  What the?  Haaa! Who? Who are you?	['damn', 'hell']
Clean Garrison	8	1	I am you.  I am your gay side.	['gay']
Unkempt Garrison	11	2	My gay side, uh- I DON'T HAVE A GAY SIDE!!!	['gay', 'gay']
Clean Garrison	6	0	You must face me at last.	[]
Unkempt Garrison	8	0	You aren't real! You can't be!	[]
Clean Garrison	10	1	It is me, your darkest fear. Your gay self, incarnate.	['gay']
Unkempt Garrison	4	0	What do you want?	[]
Clean Garrison	15	0	I want you to not fight me anymore. To accept me, once and for all.	[]
Unkempt Garrison	1	0	Why?	[]
Clean Garrison	26	0	Don't you see?  All these years, your pain, your confusion, it comes from one place. Your denial of who you are.  Of who... we are.	[]
Unkempt Garrison	10	1	But I'm not gay! Everyone just thinks I am!	['gay']
Clean Garrison	20	1	Oh, stop it! What about the time you looked at Counselor Mackey's penis in the men's locker room?!	['penis']
Unkempt Garrison	5	0	I was just comparing size!	[]
Clean Garrison	3	0	For seven minutes?!	[]
Unkempt Garrison	1	0	Aaa!	[]
Clean Garrison	18	1	And what about the time you masturbated to the men's 100-meter swimming relay at the Olympics?!	['masturbated']
Unkempt Garrison	7	0	I was beating off to the chicks!	[]
Clean Garrison	4	0	THERE WERE NO CHICKS!	[]
Unkempt Garrison	8	1	OH, DAMN YOU SPIRIT! HAUNT ME NO LONGER!	['damn']
Clean Garrison	2	0	ADMIT IT!	[]

New challenges, new experiences. A fun game is a game that gets harder as it goes. So it is with life. Do you understand?	[]
