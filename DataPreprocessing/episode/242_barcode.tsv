Mr. Mackey	232	0	Students, I would like to introduce you all to the future.__M'kay. Starting today, our school will be operating entirely on IntelliLink.__Now whenever you need to see the school nurse, or talk to me, your counselor, you can simply sign up using this simple, integrated portal.__M'kay...__You can use a computer or any of the IntelliLink panels which are located throughout the school.__Lat's say you're in the cafeteria, m'kay. You start cougin' up blood and need to see the nurse. You just click on school clinic_Mkay, see nurse._M'kay. Respiration problems.__Uh, okay, I must have I must have been in the wrong menu, uhkay. As you can see, you can control the sound system as well. Okay.__It's all integrated and smartlinked, and this is a great idea, m'kay. Let's look at the message board.__Mesage... board.__Here you can easily write messages to each other or to the faculty, m'kay? For instance,__here we go.

Sheila	14	0	Oh, Kyle, your little brother is, getting older. He's not a baby anymore.	[]
Kyle	15	0	I know, but he posted a message of me with a schlong on my head.	[]
Sheila	35	0	It's natural, bubbe. Part of getting older is finding ways to assert your independence. You know. Why don't you go and try to talk to him - you can win him over again._	[]
Kyle	6	0	Hey Ike, how's it going?	[]
Ike	12	0	Get out of my room, Kyle! I'm on my computer!_	[]

Kyle	5	0	Ike, is that chewing tobacco?	[]
Ike	8	1	What?! You gonna fuckin' narc and tell Mom?!	['fuckin']
Kyle	9	0	No, I just don't think it's healthy.	[]
Ike	25	1	That's 'cause you don't understand shit!__I knew this was a bad idea!__I'm gonna watch Yo Gabba Gabba in my roomsy!	['shit']
Mr. Mackey	4	0	Come in, m'kay.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Mr. Mackey, can I talk to you?	[]
Mr. Mackey	11	0	Oh-kay, have you set up a counseling appointment on IntelliLink?	[]

Mr. Mackey	8	0	Well it sounds like he's hittin' puberty.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Yeah, he just seems so young.	[]
Mr. Mackey	62	0	Well, your brother is Canadian. Perhaps Canadian puberty is a little different. Why don't you educate yourself about Canadian puberty and it could be somethin' yeeyou and your brother can actually do together. M'kay?__You know, this is the first time I've been able to do counseling aaand go to the bathroom at the same time. IntelliLink is amazing.	[]
Minister	84	2	Hello young people, and welcome to the most fascinating time of your life. You have braved the trials of childhood, and now you are reaching Canadian puberty. By now, you've probably noticed some changes in your body. For instance, when you fart your dick gets hard.__Other physical changes are happening to your body as well. If you're a boy you may notice that your testicles ache, or if you're a girl, you may notice a tingling sensation in your strange.	['fart', 'dick']
Ike	9	0	This is stupid, bro! I already know all this!	[]
Kyle	8	0	Let's just give it a chance, Ike.	[]
Minister	168	4	Going through Canadian puberty, you may notice that your voice is starting to change as well. You're saying things like hey boddy and hey guy because now that you're older you're discovering that someone who was once your buddy is now your guy, and someone who you used to call guy is quickly becoming your friend.__But now let's discuss how a man and a woman make love.__First, a man and a woman fall in love. Then the man farts on the woman's strange,__filling the woman's strange with air so that the woman can queef on the man's face.__And, a baby is born._ The entire process can take up to six months a-__It's what? ... That's not how a baby is born? ... What's semen? ... Well then, why did my wife queef on my face? ... She said it was to- ...__Well then why would sh-?! ... I'm gonna get to the bottom of this!_	['farts', 'queef', 'semen', 'queef']
Minister	8	0	Make me look like an idiot, will you?!	[]
Minister	17	1	Ey! You told me you queefed on my face because because that's how babies are born!	['queefed']
Wife	4	0	I was being sarcastic.	[]
Minister	15	0	Being sarcastic?! I just told a million Canadian teenages that's how it's done!	[]
Wife	23	0	I was angry because you never listen to me. Because I wanted you to go with me to therapy and you never go.	[]
Minister	11	0	Fine! You want me to go with you to therapy?! Fine!	[]
Minister	10	1	Totally embarrassing and degrading! She queefed right in my face!	['queefed']
Therapist	18	0	Well, maybe you should spend less time at work making public health films and more time at home.	[]
Kyle	6	1	What the fuck is going on?!	['fuck']
Ike	6	1	You're fucking stupid, Kyle!_	['fucking']
Kyle	23	0	I don't know what else to do, dude. No matter what I try, me and Ike just seem to drift further apart!	[]
Stan	10	0	He doesn't ever want to play with you anymore?	[]

Cody	13	0	Uh huh, well here's the problem: your amsrtnames aren't intelligrated._	[]
Mr. Mackey	3	0	Oh I see.	[]
Cody	18	0	If you wanna have those intelligrated with EasyLink, you might wanna upgrade your system to the silver package.	[]
Mr. Mackey	13	0	Uh, I I needed the silver package? Okay okay? Can we do that?	[]
Cody	9	0	Let my call my supervisor on the intelliphone._	[]
Kyle	2	0	Hey Ike.	[]
Ike	10	0	Get out of my room, Kyle! I'm playing trucks!	[]

Toodee	4	0	No, that's wrong!	[]
Plex	4	0	Don't do it.	[]
Brobee	2	0	Uh uh.	[]
Kyle	14	0	We're so sorry. Please forgive my little brother. He's going through puberty.	[]
Muno	8	0	A little young for that, isn't he?	[]
Kyle	5	0	That's what I thought.	[]
Ike	19	1	This is stupid, bro.__Foofa shouldn't be limiting herself to little kids. She's fuckin' fine, dude._	['fuckin']
Plex	14	0	What you did was very traumatic for Foofa. Isn't that right, Foofa?__Foofa?	[]
Foofa	22	0	He's right, Plex. We're getting older. I don't wanna do the little kid thing the rest of my life.	[]
Brobee	6	0	Foofa, what are you talking about?	[]
Foofa	22	1	It's time for us to start playing to older people. Maybe we need to be edgier. Have a little sex appeal.	['sex']
Toodee	2	0	Foofa, no!	[]
Foofa	26	0	I'm an artist. And if all I ever do is play to kids, then I'll be a joke.__I have to move on._	[]
Plex	8	0	Oh God. What has this little boy done??	[]
Minister	31	1	I try not to think about it, Rick. I try to just forget aboot it and then move on, but I can't. I mean... she queefed right in my face!	['queefed']
Rick	9	0	Have you and your wife seen a therapist together?	[]
Minister	30	1	Yes, we went but... I just can't erase the memory of my helpless face being queefed on like that. Who's to say she won't do it again?	['queefed']
Rick	13	0	Don't you think this has something to do with your new job?	[]
Minister	4	0	What do you mean?	[]
Rick	41	2	There's more to this, Terry. A lady never queefs in her lord's face without some major cause. You started as the Canadian Minister of Health and three months later your wife queefed in your face. There's a connection.	['queefs', 'queefed']
Terry	23	0	I took the job to try and make Canada's health care system better. What could that have to do with my wife?	[]
Rick	17	0	Terry, I'm your friend. And I'm not just your friend, I'm also your boddy	[]
Terry	2	0	Thanks, guy.	[]
Rick	31	0	And I'm telling you there's more to this than you think!__And if you want to save your marriage, and your face, you need to figure it out quick.	[]
Principal Victoria	23	0	Mr. Mackey, so far the school has spent__$22,000 on the IntelliLink system, and so far it's been an unmitigated disaster.	[]
Mr. Mackey	18	0	Well yeah, but see, the problem is not everyone is not everyone is signed on to it yet.	[]
Mr. Adler	18	0	They can't sign on to it because every time they try they make the sprinklers go off!	[]
Mr. Mackey	42	0	I know that IntelliLink has had some... hiccups... uhkay. But I've hired a new faculty member whose sole responsibility will be to oversee the IntelliLink system and make sure it runs smoothly. I want you all to meet Pat Conners._	[]
Pat	2	0	Hello everyone.	[]
Mr. Mackey	26	1	Don't Hello us, Pat! This system that you're responsible for now isn't working out! So__what the hell are you gonna do about it?!	['hell']
Pat	14	0	Oh. Well, I'm just sort of getting acclimated to the situation and I-	[]
Mr. Mackey	70	3	Getting acclimated?!__Do you know how much money we wated on that thing?! How about you take some damned responsibility! Get the hell out of here, Pat! You're fired! Get out!__Well. How the hell are we gonna clean up Pat's mess? I guess, I dunno, I guess we got no choice, m'kay. We're just gonna need to the upgrade to the IntelliLink Gold Package._	['damned', 'hell', 'hell']
Principal Victoria	2	0	Oh noo!	[]
Mr. Mackey	18	0	No, see, it's a $10,000 upgrade, but it should clean up all of Pat's mistakes.	[]
Coach	23	0	Mr. Mackey, let's be clear. IntelliLink was your idea. You should admit it was a bad one and stop being so defensive.	[]
Mr. Mackey	37	0	Well ih it's good to be a little defensive around you, Miles, m'kay. Let's, let's not forget that your wife died of an accident while you were drinking on a hike, N'kay!	[]
Miles	4	0	Hey now listen here-!	[]
Mr. Mackey	23	1	No! Now you listen to me!__IntelliLink is a great idea, and we just need the Goddamned Gold Package! We are doublin' down!	['goddamned']
Anchor	75	1	You are watching E! Entertainment News. God knows why.__She's all grown up and she wants you to know it. From kids show star to sex symbol, Yo Gabba Gabba's Foofa is ready to rock!__She's been seen out partying, photographed smoking pot, and now, Foofa has announced a raunchy performance on the MTV Video Music Awards. Foofa's new manager claims the MTV performance will be one for the record books.	['sex']
Ike	20	0	Foofa's got that nice shaved strange that you just wanna get in and tame the second you see it.	[]
Anchor	8	0	The video awards are at 8 pm tomorrow.	[]
Foofa	5	0	Oh this is so exciting!	[]

Foofa	7	0	I'm done being a kiddie star!	[]
Plex	12	0	Foofa, you don't have to show your strange to get attention.	[]
Ike	12	0	You just don't get it 'cause you're a robot, Plex.	[]
Plex	20	0	Alright, you won't listen to us, but maybe you'll listen to our special guest, Sinead O'Connor!_	[]
Sinead	15	1	Don't do it, Foofa, Don't sell out your strange to those corporate bastards.	['bastards']
Ike	13	1	Awww, screw off, Sinead O'Connor. No one gives a crap about you.	['crap']
Plex	7	0	Don't show your strange on TV.	[]
Troupe	5	0	Don't show your strange.	[]
Plex	13	0	Your strange is for your husband, not for all the world to see.	[]
Troupe	7	0	Don't show your strange on TV	[]
Sinead	10	0	I'm looking for a boyfriend. Looking for a boyfriend.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Will you get out of my living room, please?!__Hello?!	[]
Terry	12	1	...Have you ever had someone you love queef in your face?_	['queef']
Kyle	1	0	What?	[]
Terry	27	0	I'm sorry, I'm calling everyone in the Canadian health care system to find out if they're pleased with their health care. Is this__Ike Broflovski?	[]
Kyle	5	0	No, this is his brother.	[]
Terry	19	0	Your brother receives his medication from us, so we just wanna be sure he's satisfied with the service.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Satisfied with-__Wait a minute. What medication?!	[]
Terry	19	1	Before this meeting continues, I should have you be aware that my face has tested positive for queefie sores.	['queefie']
Kyle	26	0	Ah I'm sorry, but I don't really care. I just want to know what medication my little has been getting from you, and why?!	[]
Terry	10	0	People all over the world get their medication from Canada.	[]
Kyle	14	0	Yeah, but something is wrong with my brother and it might be your fault!	[]
Terry	16	0	That's impossible! The Canadian health care system is completely integrated and streamlined with IntelliLink._	[]
Kyle	12	0	You use IntelliLink?? Oh my God! Will you check his records please?	[]
Terry	13	0	Sure, no problem.__Now, what is your brother's Canadian Medicare's smartname?	[]
Kyle	4	0	I dunno!__Try strangetamer.	[]
Terry	59	0	strangetamer__Uh, yeP, there it is.__Ahh yes, here we go. I see your little brother has a constipation problem and has been taking a daily laxative since last May.__Ah, yes, I'm afraid IntelliLink mixed that up and your brother has been receiving large doses of hormones that were supposed to go to an athlete in the northeast.	[]
Kyle	17	0	Are you saying that Ike has been given regular doses of hormones because of an IntelliLink screwup?!	[]
Terry	4	0	Yes, that's right.	[]
Kyle	12	0	That system is totally screwed up and does nothing but wreak havoc!	[]
Terry	20	0	It's fine!__It works fine! Just give it some time!__God, you sound like my wife!__My... my wife.	[]
Rick	29	0	That must be it. Don't you see, Terry? That health care integration system has made you defensive and hostile, and your wife's been puttin' up with it.	[]
Terry	9	1	And... that's why she queefed in my face.	['queefed']
Kyle	22	0	Ex-cuse me?! If my little brother has been getting some athlete's hormones, then who has been getting Ike's medication?!	[]

Cody	7	0	...What exactly do you mean by work?	[]
Mr. Mackey	27	0	I just want students to be able to make appointments to see the counselor, be able to see the school norse in the easiest, most streamlined fashion!	[]
Cody	42	0	Oh, you want the Centurion package. That's where we take all the IntelliLink panels and we rip them off the walls and we burn them. Then we wipe all the computers of IntelliLink software and you never deal with us again.	[]
Mr. Mackey	7	0	Alright, upgrade me to the Centurion package.	[]
Cody	28	0	Right away.__Well alright sir, here's a clipboard you can use for students to sign up for counseling,__and I wanna thank you for choosing IntelliLink._	[]

Host	12	2	Give it up for the sexiest bitch on earth, it's Foofa!	['sexiest', 'bitch']
Foofa	4	0	Come on, Ike. Ike?	[]
Ike	37	0	He's right, Foofa. Part of growing up is rebelling, but I'm gonna get older whether I like it or not. So why push it? I think I'm just gonna let it happen naturally._	[]
Yo Gabba Gabba	1	0	Yaaaaay.	[]
Brobee	2	0	Foofa?_	[]
Foofa	16	0	Come on, come on, and pound my strange._Pound it like this,__pound it like that.	[]
Terry	4	0	It was a mistake.	[]
Wife	1	0	What?	[]
Terry	34	0	Trying to reform Canada's health care system and being too stubborn to admit that it wasn't working. And even when my wife said the system was too complicated, I wouldn't listen.	[]
Wife	18	1	Oh Terry, I was just trying to get your attention. I'm sorry I queefed in your face.	['queefed']
Terry	29	1	I deserved it. Anyone who thinks streamlining health care into an integreated health care system would go smoothly deserves a giant queef in their face. Thank you, my lady.	['queef']
Wife	6	0	So IntelliLink is gone, my lord?	[]
