Kyle	10	1	Goddammit Cartman, stop throwin' those stupid poppy-things at me!	['goddammit']
Roger	17	0	Come on and take a look, folks. We've got a lot of knives for sale here.	[]
Stan	11	0	Oh my God, look!  Martial arts weapons from the Far East.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Wow, cool.	[]
Stan	14	0	Dude! We should each buy a weapon, and then we'll be like ninjas.	[]
Cartman	10	1	Yeah. We won't have to take crap from anybody.	['crap']
Kyle	9	0	Our parents won't let us have weapons, dude.	[]
Cartman	6	1	Who's gonna tell them, dumbass?!	['dumbass']
Stan	30	0	Yeah, dude, our parents are gonna be at the stupid fair all day long. They'll never know what we bought.  I'll get the tonfas.  Those are so sweet.	[]
Cartman	24	0	I'm gonna get those killer sai.  Look Kenny! There's something even you can afford! A ninja shuriken  for a dollar ninety nine.	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Shuriken. Awesome!)	[]
Roger	5	0	Can I help you boys?	[]
Stan	11	0	Yeah. We wanna get one of each of these ninja weapons.	[]
Roger	26	0	Okay, uh, you need to have your parents here when you buy them, though. I, I can't sell to anyone under eighteen without parents' permission.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Parents? Parents?!  Oh God!	[]
Roger	6	0	Wha- wha- what's the matter?	[]
Stan	15	0	We, we're brothers, see, and our parents... died in a car accident last year.	[]
Cartman	12	0	Why?!  Why?! Why did you have to take them both?! Why?!  Why?!	[]
Kyle	14	0	Why do people have to keep reminding us of what we don't have?!	[]
Roger	24	0	It's all right, it's all right boys. Don't cry, I'll... I'll just... go pack these up for you, okay?	[]
Stan	10	1	Goddamn, that's like the twelfth time that's worked.	['goddamn']
Stan	2	0	Kiya! Kiya!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Kaii yo!	[]
Cartman	9	0	Giya! Shut up, hippies! I'll kill you!  Iya!	[]
Stan	23	0	With my tonfa of Takanawa, I become the great and powerful ninja Shadowhachi, born to fight evil and people I don't like.	[]
Kyle	19	0	Yeah. And my powerful nunchakus make me into Bunroku , a deadly but compassionate ninja who protects those in trouble.	[]
Stan	6	0	What's your ninja name, Kenny?	[]
Kenny	1	0	(unintelligible)	[]
Cartman	19	0	Yes. And I... am Bulrog. Tough brute ninja who has dedicated his life to eradicating the world of hippies	[]
Stan	9	0	All right, ninjas! Let's go protect the world!	[]
Cartman	2	1	Kick ass!	['ass']
Cartman	25	0	Hey, you guys, you know what we should do? We should go show our weapons to Craig and those guys. They'll be so jealous.	[]
Kenny	5	0	(Yeah, that'd be awesome!)	[]
Kyle	20	0	No dude, we can't go around showing our weapons to people. Our parents'll find out we have them.	[]
Cartman	17	1	Ech! You see, guys? This is why Jews can't be ninjas! They've got no spine!	['jews']
Kyle	8	1	You don't know anything about Jews, fatass!	['jews']
Cartman	36	0	Oh yeah?! My mom took me to see Mel Gibson's movie, The Passion, and Mel Gibson says you are sneaks and you are liars. And if the Road Warrior says it, it must be true.	[]
Stan	21	0	Don't worry, Kyle. Craig's not gonna tell on us. Come, ninjas, let's go.  All right, this is it.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Yes. The residence of the one called... Craig.	[]
Kyle	8	0	I still say this is a bad idea.	[]
Stan	4	0	Ninja positions!  Hello, Craig!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Look what we got.	[]
Craig	5	0	Where'd you get those?	[]
Stan	14	0	We can't tell you where we got 'em! It's secret ninja stuff.	[]
Cartman	21	0	Ooo, is that jealousy I see in your eyes, Craig? Mmm, yes, drown me in the sweet water of your envy.	[]
Craig	7	0	Uh-uh, they're not that cool.	[]
Stan	15	0	Hyeah, they're not that cool. These are real authentic weapons from the Far East.	[]
Kyle	8	0	But don't tell anybody we have them.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Ugh.	[]
Token	6	0	Whoa! Where'd you get those?!	[]
Clyde	3	0	Let me see.	[]
Stan	16	0	Uh, we'd love to hang out guys, but we have important secret work to do.	[]
Cartman	15	0	Yes. The life of a ninja is complex and full of peril.  Come on, ninjas!	[]
All	1	1	Ho!	['ho']
Cartman	14	0	Aw man, did you see the look on Craig's face?! That was awesome!	[]
Stan	11	0	Dude, we're like the coolest kids in the whole state!	[]
Butters	5	0	Hey fellas. What's happenin'?	[]
Cartman	5	0	We're playing Ninjas, Butters.	[]
Butters	8	0	Wowee! Hey, can I play, ninjas with you?	[]
Cartman	24	0	No, Butters. We are a very select elite fighting team sent to protect the world from evil, and you can't play with us.	[]
Stan	21	0	Yeah, Butters. You wouldn't make a very good ninja. Come on, guys.  We have a lot of work to do.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Yes, and no time to do it. No time...	[]
Butters	26	0	I think I'd make a really good ninja.  Jeez, those guys never let me play with them. Uh, they just shun me all the time.	[]
Butters	12	0	I'm a lost soul. A dark lonely shadow of a person-	[]
Linda	2	0	Hi Butters.	[]
Butters	80	0	Hi Mom.  -a castaway, forced to live his life out in solitude.  And it's because of times like these I was forced to a life of evil.  Society cast me out, and so I vowed to make them all pay! And pay they did! Nobody knows that beneath this sweet eight-year-old little boy lies the most evil, the most destructive super-villain of all time!  Professor Chaos!  Let's see how you like dealing with me, ninjas!	[]
Linda	9	0	Ooo, Butters, are you going out to play again?	[]
Butters	11	0	Yeah Mom, I'm just goin' outside for a little while.	[]
Linda	26	0	Well, could you be a sweetie and take that pie over there to the Thomsons. I made it to thank them for babysitting you last week.	[]
Butters	6	0	Well, o- okay Mom.  Bah! Gah!	[]
Stan	24	0	Hm, this doesn't seem to be the right way. My ninja sense is telling me we might be heading in the wrong direction.	[]
Kyle	23	0	Okay, hang on guys. I'll use my special power to see into the future and find out where we should head next.	[]
Cartman	24	0	Hold on you guys. I actually have another power. I can see into the future too, but better than Kyle. Let me try it.	[]
Kyle	11	1	God dammit, Cartman! You can't keep making up new powers!	['dammit']
Stan	13	0	Yeah dude, that's like the fifth power you've come up with!	[]
Cartman	11	0	I am Bulrog and I have lots and lots of powers.	[]
Kyle	16	1	No asshole! From now on you only get to have one power! So what is it?!	['asshole']
Cartman	11	0	I have the power to have all the powers I want.	[]
Kyle	5	0	That doesn't count, fatass!	[]
Stan	12	0	Yeah, that it, Cartman! You don't get to have any powers!	[]
Cartman	2	0	C'mon!	[]
Butters	15	0	Haaa ha ha ha ha!  Well well well! If it isn't the four ninjas!	[]
Kyle	5	1	Who the hell is that?	['hell']
Stan	6	0	I dunno. Craig, is that you?	[]
Butters	19	0	Fools!  I am Professor Chaos! Bringer of Destruction and Doom!  Your feeble ninja powers are no match for me!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Whoa.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Looks like we have a sworn enemy, you guys.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Yeah.)	[]
Stan	24	0	Very well, Professor Chaos! We'll play along. Now, fell the fiery sting of my tonfa of Takanawa!  Hey kid, that knocks you down.	[]
Butters	2	0	Nuh uh!	[]
Stan	5	0	Yeah, huh, I got you!	[]
Butters	16	0	Nuh uh! Because my cloak is made of a... titanium alloy that shields me from heat!	[]
Cartman	7	2	That's bullcrap! Titanium alloy my ass!	['bullcrap', 'ass']
Kyle	15	0	Well, let's see how he likes the icy blasts from my nunchucks of Sokuromoto!	[]
Butters	29	0	Huh nice attempt, ninja! But now both of you shall feel the power of my Web of Holding!  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! You are both trapped in spiderwebs!	[]
Cartman	34	1	All right, dickhole! Time for you to pay!  Oh no! I have no powers! Kyle took them away from me! Quick, Kyle, give me back my powers so I can fight this evil villain!	['dickhole']
Kyle	8	0	Okay, okay, you can have your powers back.	[]
Cartman	16	0	All right! And now I will use my power to...  turn Kyle into a chicken! Bleh!	[]
Kyle	3	1	God dammit Cartman!	['dammit']
Cartman	13	0	Ha, ha, ha, ha, haaa, ha! Now you are a chicken! Nyanyanyanyanyaaa nya!	[]
Butters	12	0	Enough! I grow weary of your foolishness. Professor Chaos cannot be stopped!	[]
Stan	7	0	Oh yeah?! Kenny! Use your ninja star!	[]
Kenny	8	0	(Yeah! Take this, Professor Chaos!)  (Feel my wrath!)	[]
Cartman	3	1	Oh, shit, dude!	['shit']
Stan	12	0	Butters! Oh my God!  Oh, dude! It's stuck in his eye!	[]
Kyle	9	1	What the hell did you do that for, Kenny?!	['hell']
Kenny	8	0	(I just threw my ninja star at him.)	[]
Butters	4	0	It hurts! It hurts!	[]
Kyle	7	0	Oh man! We are in serious trouble!	[]
Stan	14	0	Sh shhhh. It's okay, Butters. Calm down. It's not that bad, really.	[]
Butters	16	0	But I... But I... But I can't see nothin'. I gotta go to the hospital!	[]
Stan	9	0	Okay okay, calm down, Butters! It'll be okay!	[]
Cartman	34	0	Guys, meeting over here for a second?  All right you guys, we need to stay calm and just do the right thing. We have to kill Butters and bury him in Kyle's backyard.	[]
Stan	3	0	Dude, shut up!	[]
Kyle	4	0	I agree with Cartman!	[]
Stan	1	0	What?!	[]
Kyle	20	0	You don't understand what my mom will do to me if she finds out I was playing with weapons!	[]
Stan	4	0	Just stay still, Butters.	[]
Butters	3	0	Ah.  Hwa!  Hwaaaaa!	[]
Kyle	8	0	Stop dude! You're gonna scramble his brain!	[]
Cartman	13	0	Go ahead and scramble it, then he won't remember it was us.	[]
Butters	15	0	You guys can't fix my eyeball! You have to take me to the hospital!	[]
Kyle	14	0	If we take him to the hospital, they're gonna find out what happened.	[]
Stan	2	1	God dammit!	['dammit']
Kyle	19	0	God? Please, if you get me out of this, I swear, I will never play with weapons ever again.	[]
Cartman	48	0	Don't be so quick to throw off your ninja responsibility, Kyle.  Now, come on guys, sure, it's easy to be a ninja when everything's going your way, but it's times like these, when the chips are down, that a ninja shows his true character.	[]
Butters	5	0	Whoa, I'm getting woozy.	[]
Cartman	19	0	Shut up, Butters.  Now, there's a way out of this. We just have to use our... ninja reasoning.	[]
Stan	22	0	We... need a doctor... But we can't go to the hospital. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait. What about the veterinarian?	[]
Cartman	2	0	Dr. Shafley?	[]
Stan	7	0	He's really old and going blind.	[]
Cartman	11	0	So if we make Butters up to look like a dog...	[]
Kyle	2	0	Oh no.	[]
Stan	8	0	We might pass him off as our pet.	[]
Butters	24	0	But, but fellas, if I, if I dress up like a dog with a star in my eye, I- I'm gonna get grounded.	[]
"Stan, Kyle, Cartman"	3	0	Shut up, Butters!	[]
Kyle	29	0	That is the dumbest idea you guys have ever come up with! I'd expect this stupidity out of Cartman, but you, Stan?! Butters needs medical attention right now!	[]
Stan	24	0	All right, then you take him to the hospital, Kyle. You take him to the hospital and let your mom find out what happened.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Hand me the modeling glue. We need more fur over here.	[]
Butters	8	0	Uh, that modeling glue is making me dizzy.	[]
Cartman	14	2	Butters! We're trying to help you, Goddamnit! Now, stop being such an asshole!	['goddamnit', 'asshole']
Kyle	10	0	We need some more fur.  I think that's good.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Okay, let's hear your bark, Butters.	[]
Butters	4	0	Uh. Wuff, wu-wuff.	[]
Stan	10	0	All right. Now we just gotta sneak him into town.	[]
Stan	4	0	Okay, it's clear.	[]
Cartman	39	0	Now remember, Butters, when you get to the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and- Butters, listen! At the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and bark a lot.	[]
Butters	3	0	Wuhuff, woof, woof.	[]
Kyle	8	0	We've gotta hurry, it's getting late!	[]
Stan	5	1	Oh shit, somebody's coming!	['shit']
Kyle	3	0	Quick, hide Butters!	[]
Cartman	2	0	In here!	[]
Butters	5	0	bu- but fellas, I gotta-	[]
Craig	20	0	Aha!  There you are! You guys thought you were so cool, didn't you?! Well look at what we got!	[]
Cartman	6	0	No way, you got weapons too?!	[]
Stan	5	0	Where'd you get those?	[]
Jimmy	10	0	From the n-n- from the nn-, from the nn-	[]
Clyde	8	0	From the nice guy at the county fair.	[]
Craig	16	0	At first we needed our parents' permission, but then we told him our parents were dead.	[]
Cartman	11	1	Aw man, now every douchebag in town has a weapon! Lame!	['douchebag']
Craig	9	0	So,  how would you ninjas like to do battle?	[]
Stan	10	0	Uh, not now, Craig, we we have to be going.	[]
Craig	12	0	You can't pass through this area until you defend your honor!	[]
Kyle	5	0	He said, not now, Craig!	[]
Craig	15	0	I am not Craig,  I am Ginza,  with the powerful blade of the kitana. Iya!	[]
Token	11	0	And I am Black Chaku,  with the power of perfect spelling!	[]
Stan	9	0	Guys, we're we're really not playing, okay?	[]
Jimmy	17	0	Wha, what, what's the m-matter, f-fellas? Are you ... nnnninjas or p-p-p-pussies?	[]
Cartman	8	1	We're twice the ninjas you fags are!	['fags']
Clyde	3	0	Then fight us!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Very well, Clyde. Kiyaaaa!	[]
Kyle	6	0	I swore to never fight again.	[]
Stan	11	0	We don't have a choice, Kyle. Just humor them. Hyaaaaah!	[]

Kyle	10	0	Uuuh, Chef, you haven't seen Butters around, have you?	[]
Chef	16	0	No, can't say that I have. Hey, what are you children doin' with those weapons?	[]
Stan	3	0	Nothing, just... playing.	[]
Chef	15	0	Well, you children should be careful with those. You could put somebody's eye out.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Yeah, we know.	[]

Announcer	128	0	In our last episode the four ninjas did battle with Professor Chaos, bringer of destruction and doom. It was during that great battle that ninja master Kenny threw his star into Professor Chaos' eye. Now the ninjas were in serious trouble, because their parents might find out they had weapons, if Professor Chaos told on them. While trying to get Professor Chaos some aid at the veterinarian's office, the four ninjas ran into Craig and his three friends. They challenged the four ninjas to fight, and the legendary battle of Tokutawa began. It was during this battle that Professor Chaos escaped, and so the four ninjas were forced to join forces with Craig and his friends to find Professor Chaos, or else they would all be grounded.	[]
Stan	1	0	Butters!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Butters!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Here, Butters!	[]

Clyde	1	0	Butters!	[]
Token	1	0	Butters!	[]
Craig	6	1	Butters! Where the hell are you?!	['hell']
Kyle	31	0	It's hopeless, dude! Butters must have made it to the hospital. By now our parents probably know we were playing with weapons! We have to get rid of the evidence!	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Kyle	18	0	Dude, we have to get rid of our weapons so at least we can try to deny everything.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Screw that, dude, I paid twenty bucks for these things!	[]
Stan	12	0	Yeah, let's just go return them and get our money back.	[]
Kyle	15	0	We don't have time for that, dude! We just have to ditch them! Now!	[]
Cartman	39	2	Okay. Go ahead, Kyle. Throw your nunchucks away. If you can. But you know damn well that your Jewish blood won't let you. You can't throw away something you paid fifteen bucks for. Go ahead and try.	['damn', 'jewish']
Kyle	3	0	Screw you, fatass!	[]
Cartman	36	1	Mel Gibson was right, Kyle. Right now the Jew in you is screaming NO! Those cost money! Get your money back! You know this to be true.  Go ahead. Prove Mel Gibson wrong, Kyle.  Do it.	['jew']
Kyle	12	0	I- I can't do it... I can't do it. I...	[]
Stan	15	0	It's all right, Kyle. We'll go back to the fair and return them.	[]
Vet	8	0	Come on. Come on, little fella. 'Atta boy.	[]
Butters	2	0	Woof woof.	[]
Vet	15	0	Right over here.  Good dog. Come on.  There you go, right in there.  Goooood dog.	[]
Butters	1	0	Gaaaah!	[]
Assistant	11	0	Somebody threw a ninja star in that poor puppy's eye?	[]
Vet	56	0	It just makes me sick how some people can treat animals.  Well, nothing we can do for it; let's put it to sleep, shall we?  Here you go, pup. I've got a sweet dose of murder for you.  What the? Blasted! He's escaped! ...Oh well, let's murder one of these other dogs.	[]
Stan	8	0	All right, the county fair's still open!	[]
Roger	5	0	Can I help you boys?	[]
Stan	9	0	We have come to return the weapons we purchased.	[]
Roger	9	0	Uh, sorry kids, ah I don't give refunds.	[]
Kyle	18	1	Listen, doucher! Our parents are gonna kill us, and you, if they found out that we bought these!	['doucher']
Roger	9	0	I thought you told me your parents were dead.	[]
Craig	4	0	You guys!  You guys!	[]
Stan	4	0	What is it, Craig?	[]
Craig	6	0	It's Butters! We saw 'im!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Where?!	[]
Craig	14	0	Right on the other side of the fairgrounds. He's just wandering around aimlessly.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Then it's not too late!	[]
Stan	3	0	Come on, Ninjas!	[]
Barker	15	0	All right, folks, our next item up for bids is this lovely 19th Century lamp.	[]
Stan	8	1	Aw dude, crap. All our parents are there.	['crap']
Craig	7	0	Butters is right on the other side.	[]
Kyle	6	0	We have to get past them!	[]
Cartman	15	0	All right. Looks like I have to use my power of invisibility to get by.	[]
Kyle	5	0	You have that power too?	[]
Cartman	28	0	I told you, Bulrog has lots and lots of powers. Behold.  This way, I can move about the crowd of people undetected.  Here, hold this stuff for me.	[]
Stan	3	0	Good luck, Bulrog.	[]
Barker	87	1	Now, this lamp comes from the estate of Edna and James Hollinger, who lived in upstate Wyoming.  It has a bronze finish and actual gold leaf along the base. This is a rare opportunity to own a classic antique.  The lamp has been appraised by our auction staff at well over two thousand dollars.  So we're gonna start the bidding at three hundred and seventy five. Do I, do I hear three hundred and seventy five?  Kid, what the hell do you think you're doin'?	['hell']
Butters	3	0	Haba, haba! Habahoaha!	[]
Linda	1	0	Butters!	[]
Randy	4	0	What happened to him?	[]
Sheila	3	0	Oh my God!	[]
Stan	2	0	Oh, Jesus.	[]
Kyle	8	0	Oh dude, we are gonna get it now.	[]
Mayor McDaniels	22	0	All right, people, we are all extremely upset over what's happened.  But let's try to speak one at a time.	[]
Man 1	39	0	Well, like the rest of you, I am shocked and appalled at what happened! I don't know if the parents are to blame or if it's the times we're living in, but something has to change!	[]
Townsfolk	3	0	Yeah! I agree!	[]
Gerald	14	0	This is the worst thing that's happened in this town!  The worst thing!	[]
Man 2	27	1	Yeah! I mean, there were children watching that auction! And when that little eight-year-old boy walked up and flashed his... penis! It was an outrage!	['penis']
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Cartman	1	0	What?	[]
Skeeter	29	1	Not only that, the auction was televised on public access, so my little daughter watchin' at home saw the... penis! How am I supposed to explain that to her?!	['penis']
Sheila	12	0	This is what happens when the moral fabric of society breaks down!	[]
Mr. Garrison	13	0	You see the damage you've caused, Eric Cartman?! What were you thinking?!	[]
Cartman	8	0	I told you it was a wardrobe malfunction.	[]
Kyle	12	0	Dude, they don't care we knocked Butters' eye out with weapons?	[]
Stan	5	0	Just run with it, dude.	[]
Kyle	28	0	Uh, yeah! I agree! Uh- my fragile little eight-year-old mind didn't know how to deal with what I was seeing. C-Cartman should be punished!	[]
Man	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Cartman	4	1	Hey, fuck you, Kyle!	['fuck']
Kyle	8	0	Yeah, I c- I can't believe it.	[]
Stan	19	2	Yeah. I guess parents don't give a crap about violence if there's sex things to worry about.	['crap', 'sex']
Kyle	11	0	So I guess this means we get to keep our weapons.	[]
Stan	12	0	Yeah. Come on, ninjas.  We've got some more work to do.	[]
The Boys	1	0	Hya!	[]
