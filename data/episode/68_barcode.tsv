Cartman	9	0	Hey, where'd you guys get that ice cream?	[]

Jimbo	1	0	Kern.	[]

Stan	5	0	How'd he do that??	[]
Blaine	28	0	Thank you. I've been traveling from town to town for quite a while. I've started quite a following, mostly because of my levitation tricktwah. Watch.  Watch.	[]
Crowd	1	0	Whoa!!!	[]
Stan	2	0	No way!	[]
Kyle	10	1	Damn. That guy is the coolest guy in the universe!	['damn']
Blaintologist	9	0	Pamphlet. Pamphlet. Here you go, kids,  take a pamphlet.	[]
Kyle	17	0	David Blaine Workshop. Learn all about David Blaine at the Center for Magic. Dude, we gotta go.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Yeah, and they probably teach you how to do magic tricks!	[]
Speaker	32	0	Hello, everyone. My name is Steven and I've been a Blaintologist for about three years. So, when David Blaine performed his miracles out on the street, what moved you the most?	[]
Stan	3	0	His a-miracles?	[]
Steven	20	0	Oh yes, you see, David Blaine is much more than a magician. He's a scholar, a visionary, a leader.	[]
Cartman	7	0	When are we gonna learn magic tricks?	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Steven	34	0	Oh, I've got a trick for you to learn: I can show you how to make your true self appear. Let me ask you all something: Do you consider yourselves to be happy?	[]
Butters	19	0	I don't think I'm very happy. I always fall asleep to the sounds of my own screams.	[]
Steven	10	0	...Right, yeh. Eh, see, the reason that you are unha-	[]
Butters	23	0	And then I always get woken up in the morning by the sounds of my own screams. Do you think I'm unhappy?	[]
Steven	46	0	Wait, the.. the point is... that you can be happy. You see, your friends and parents have programmed you in a way that makes you feel isolated and alone. How many times have you felt like nobody knows the real... you?  You're not really happy.	[]
Kyle	5	0	I'm not really happy.	[]
Steven	7	0	Your potential hasn't even been reached.	[]
Kyle	7	0	My potential hasn't even been reached.	[]
Steven	28	0	If you look through David Blaine's incredible book, you'll find a lot of life's answers. Let's read some of the book together, shall we?	[]
Cartman	11	0	Then we get to be in David Blaine's secret club?	[]
Steven	3	0	That's right.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Cool.	[]
Sheila	5	0	Ike, eat your gefilte fish.	[]
Ike	2	0	No-oo.	[]
Kyle	14	0	Mom. Mom. I found out all about this great new magician named David Blaine.	[]
Sheila	6	0	That's nice, Kyle. Ike, eat!	[]
Kyle	37	0	We spent all afternoon learning about how we aren't actually happy. I had no idea how unhappy I was until today. They gave me this cool book to read, and I'm already on chapter four....	[]
Sheila	23	0	Well, it's nice to see you so interested in something, Kyle. Ike, for the love of Abraham, you are gonna eat this.	[]
Kyle	29	0	So can I go to the Magic Camp, to learn how to become a full member? All the other guys are doin' it, and it's only $69.95.	[]
Sheila	15	0	Magic Camp? I don't know, bubbe, ask your father.  Ike, you will eat this!	[]
Barber	10	0	Prepare to be cleansed and release the magic inside you.	[]
Butters	12	0	I am prepared.  Hoh, jeez, eh it sure got cold in here.	[]
Barber	1	0	Next?	[]
Steven	41	0	Congratulations, young Blaintologists. From this day, you are clean.  Now, we have very important work to do! David Blaine is going to put on a big magic show in Denver tomorrow night, where he's going to eat his own head.	[]
Recruits	1	0	Wow!	[]
Steven	28	0	So it's up to all you new Blaintologists to get as many people there as you can. Whoever gets the most people to come gets a prize!	[]
Stan	13	0	Kyle, I'm starting to think that this is a really bad idea.	[]
Butters	13	0	Ha-I'm not Kyle, I'm Butters. I thought you were Kyle.	[]
Stan	4	0	No, I'm Stan.	[]
Kyle	6	0	You're Stan? Where's Kenny?	[]
Stan	3	0	Who are you?	[]
Kyle	3	0	I'm Kyle.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Heheh, guess who I am, guys?	[]
Stan	11	0	Kyle, I think we may have gotten into something bad here.	[]
Kyle	12	0	What do you mean? We're learning all kinds of cool stuff.	[]
Stan	20	0	Look at us, dude. These people are trying to change us somehow. I think it's time we went home.	[]
Kyle	11	0	But David Blaine is gonna do more miracles in Denver tomorrow..	[]
Stan	9	0	I don't care! I'm leaving!  'Scuse me.	[]
Aide	4	0	Where are you going?	[]
Stan	4	0	I'm going home.	[]
Aide	7	0	You don't want to go home.	[]
Stan	10	0	You said we're free to leave whenever we want	[]
Aide	2	0	You are.	[]
Stan	5	0	Move out of the way.	[]
Aide	22	0	I'm not in the way. You are. Are you unhappy with the Church's teachings? Let's just talk about it	[]
Stan	11	0	I don't wanna talk about it, I jus' wanna leave.	[]
Aide	18	0	Why don't we go into the back room for a second, and talk? Then you can leave.	[]
Stan	12	0	That's okay, I... I changed my mind. I'm... gonna stay.	[]
Aide	4	0	That's great news.	[]
Stan	5	0	Okay, it's all clear.	[]
Kyle	4	0	What are we doing?	[]
Stan	15	0	We're getting out of here. This whole thing has gotten way out of hand.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Whoa whoa, I'm not going anywhere.	[]
Stan	6	0	Come on, Kyle, this is stupid!	[]
Kyle	18	0	It's not stupid, Stan. For once in my life I feel like I'm part of something.	[]
Stan	11	1	A part of what?! Some gaywad magician's crazy life plan?!	['gaywad']
Kyle	12	1	Don't call Mr. Blaine a gaywad! He's a brilliant man.	['gaywad']
Stan	15	0	No, they've just convinced you that he's a brilliant man! Let's go!	[]
Kyle	5	0	I'm not going anywhere!	[]
Stan	11	1	Goddamnit, I'm not going with you! I wanna stay here!	['goddamnit']
Kyle	7	0	Huh? I thought you wanted to leave.	[]
Stan	6	0	Oh wait, who am I again?	[]
Kyle	3	0	You're Stan.	[]
Stan	31	2	Oh- oh yeah. God- Goddamnnit, hold on a second.  Okay. Now look, dude, I'm getting out of here, and you're a dumbass if you don't come with me!	['goddamnnit', 'dumbass']
Kyle	7	1	Then I guess... I'm a dumbass.	['dumbass']
Stan	8	0	Kyle, please. You-  You're my best friend.	[]
Kyle	25	0	Well, this is what I believe in now, Stan. And if you can't respect that,... then I guess we're not best friends anymore.	[]
Kyle	23	0	Hello, ma'am. My name is Kyle. And this is Cartman. We'd like to share our interest in David Blaine with you.	[]
Elderly Woman	17	0	Uh oh. My husband warned me about you Blainiacs. I'm sorry, but I'm a Catholic.	[]
Cartman	26	2	Uh it... doesn't matter, ma'am. Blaintology is for everyone. There are Blaintologists who are Catholics, Buddhists - why even Kyle here is a Goddamn Jew.	['goddamn', 'jew']
Kyle	3	0	That's right.	[]
Elderly Woman	6	0	So you're not a cult?	[]
Cartman	32	0	Of course, no. David Blaine is a real person. You may have seen his television specials on ABC. He also wrote a book, and we'd like to share it with you.	[]
Elderly Woman	5	0	Well, alright, come on in.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Cool.	[]
Kyle	22	0	...And if you look here, you can see how David Blaine performed the miracle of being frozen in ice at Times Square.	[]
Cartman	14	0	Ma'am, have you ever wondered what David Blaine's plan is for you?	[]
Elderly Woman	3	0	No, not really.	[]
Cartman	38	0	Oh, you see, that, that's interesting because... I'm so thankful for David Blaine's book, and, I'm so thankful that he showed me the way to true happiness but, I think about his plan often.	[]
Kyle	21	0	David Blaine is doing a big performance in Denver tomorrow night.  We're sure his magic will entertain and astound you!	[]
Cartman	8	0	He's going to eat his own head.	[]
Kyle	9	0	How many tickets can we put you down for?	[]
Elderly Woman	5	0	Oh, I can't go.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Oh, come on, it'll make you a happy person.	[]
Elderly Woman	3	0	I am happy.	[]
Cartman	4	0	No you're not.	[]
Elderly Woman	3	0	Yes I am.	[]
Cartman	4	0	No you're not.	[]
Elderly Woman	3	0	I really am.	[]
Cartman	4	0	No you're not.	[]
Elderly Woman	3	0	But I am.	[]
Cartman	4	0	No you're not.	[]
Elderly Woman	3	0	Alright, two tickets	[]
Kyle	1	0	Great!	[]
Kyle	16	0	That's 15 people we got to agree to come see David Blaine perform in Denver.	[]
Cartman	24	0	Yes, Brother Kyle hmm, but our work is not over. We must still recruit ten more audience members in order to get the prize.	[]
Kyle	12	0	I think if we try Kenny's neighborhood, we might find a-	[]
Cartman	9	0	Come, Brother Kyle, we have no time for him.	[]
Stan	1	0	HaaAAAA!	[]
Driver	8	0	You'd better watch yourself next time, abandoner!	[]
Stan	5	0	Hi, Jesus. It's me,	[]
"Stan, Jesus"	2	0	Stan Marsh.	[]
Jesus	9	0	Of course. I know you, my child. Come in.	[]
Stan	21	0	This guy is going around doing magic tricks and saying they're miracles! My friend Kyle thinks he's totally awesome!	[]
Jesus	16	0	You're good to bring this to my attention, Stan. Cults are a very dangerous thing.	[]
Stan	35	0	I read in the Bible that you did miracles, too. If you could go in front of these people and do your miracles, then, they'll all see that David Blaine isn't so special.	[]
Jesus	12	0	The miracle I'm most famous for is turning water into wine.	[]
Stan	5	0	Can you do it again?	[]
Jesus	34	0	Very well. I shall perform the miracle. Behold. Here you can see ordinary water, clear, clean. Okay now, turn around.  Er, nuh, tur- turn around.  Uh, okay now, turn back.  It is now wine!	[]
Stan	10	0	That's it? That's how you did that trick?	[]
Jesus	3	0	Wuh well, yeah.	[]
Stan	4	0	That trick sucks, Jesus.	[]
Jesus	14	0	Oh. Well, I guess it worked a little better on people 2000 years ago.	[]
Stan	32	0	Dude, we have to do something. This guy is performing more miracles in Denver tonight. He's gonna get more followers, and it'll be impossible for me to get Kyle out.	[]
Jesus	4	0	Then let's go.	[]
Stan	17	1	But dude, I'd I don't think you should do that lame water-to-wine trick.	['lame']
Jesus	13	0	Oh,don't worry  I have a few more miracles up my sleeve.	[]
Kyle	6	0	This is a really good turnout.	[]
Announcer	7	0	And now, ladies and gentlemen, David Blaine.	[]
Blaine	3	0	Hello, my children.	[]
Announcer	18	0	Ladies and gentlemen, may we have silence, please, as magician David Blaine will now eat... his... own... head.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Dude, no way!	[]
Blaine	26	0	Thank you, everyone.  Our organization grows larger every day. Soon, the government will even have to give us tax-exempt status as a bona fide religion.	[]
Jesus	1	0	Hold!	[]
Man	3	0	It's Jesus!	[]
Cartman	5	0	What's he doin' here?	[]
Jesus	84	0	My children, it is time for you to go home and stop following this false prophet. You should be using your money and time for other things. These are simple magic tricks. His magic is interesting, but will it put food on your table? Feeding the hungry - now that is a miracle!  Behold! I have here fives loaves of bread and three fish. Certainly not enough to feed this entire crowd, but now - turn around  Ya need tuh- turn around.  Okay, now turn back.	[]
Cartman	8	1	Now how the hell did he do that?	['hell']
Crowd	1	0	Wow!	[]
Blaine	12	0	Your magic is old and outdated, Jesus! Twah. Just like you are.	[]
Jesus	13	0	Oh, really. Then what's this  Ace of Spades doing behind your ear?	[]
Crowd	1	0	Whoa.	[]
Jesus	2	0	Jesus Christ!	[]
Elderly Woman	3	0	He's incredible!	[]
Blaine	33	0	The old religions have failed you! Twah. What have they offered except for war, poverty, and sadness? Blaintology offers you the key to living your life to the fullest! Will you join us?	[]
Crowd	1	0	Yes!!	[]
Jesus	13	0	His magic is too powerful, Stanley. I've never seen anything like it.	[]
Stan	7	0	Then what are we going to do.	[]
Jesus	20	0	I cannot face him alone. We must get the help of all the super best friends.  Buddha. Buddha, come in!	[]
Stan	3	0	Super best friends?	[]
Buddha	6	0	This is Buddha, Jesus. Go ahead.	[]
Jesus	17	0	Buddha, we may have a problem. I've just encountered a magic I've never seen before.	[]
Buddha	11	0	I'll call everyone together. Come as fast as you can.	[]
Jesus	8	0	Come, Stanley. We must travel far and long.	[]
Stan	2	0	To where?	[]
Jesus	17	0	Distances unfathomable to man. Yea, take hold of my robe, Stanley, and do not open your eyes.	[]
Stan	3	0	I am ready.	[]
Jesus	7	0	Are you still keeping your eyes closed?	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Jesus	4	0	Good. Want some peanuts?	[]
Kyle	13	0	Congratulations, sister. You have heard the noble truth and are now a Blaintologist.	[]
Steven	39	0	Everyone! Everyone, gather 'round! I have great news for all Blaintologists, and for our new members as well. We've just gotten word from Mr. Blaine himself: The government has denied our church's request for tax-exempt status!	[]
Member	6	0	But... we want tax-exempt status.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Yeah. Why is that good news?	[]
Steven	32	0	Be-cause! Mr. Blaine has arranged for all Blaintologists members from every city and state to march into Washington and demand our right for tax-exempt status by committing a mass suicide!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Mass suicide?	[]
Steven	18	0	Mr. Blaine has said that by killing ourselves in Washington, we are guaranteed everlasting happiness in the afterlife!	[]
Member	4	0	Hehehe, that sounds good.	[]
Steven	10	0	Get your things ready. We leave for Washington at dawn!	[]
Cartman	10	0	Did you hear that, guys? We're finally gonna die!	[]
Jesus	28	0	Alright, Stanley. You can open your eyes now.  This is the hall of the super best friends, Stanley, the headquarters for those who stand for what's right.	[]
Mohammad	12	0	Jesus, we've been working hard since we got your distress call!	[]
Loa Tse	3	0	Who the kid?	[]
Jesus	55	0	Stanley, I want you to meet some of the super best friends : Buddha, with the powers of invisibility; Mohammad, the Muslim prophet with the powers of flame ; Krishna, the Hindu deity; Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet; Lao Tse, the found of Taoism ; and Seaman, with the ability to breathe underwater and link mentally with fish.	[]
Stan	22	0	So you mean to tell me that even though people fight and argue over different religions, you guys are all actually friends?	[]
Mohammad	17	0	More than friends, young boy, we are super best friends, with the desire to fight for justice.	[]
Joseph Smith	21	0	We all believe in the power of good over evil. Except for Buddha, of course, who doesn't believe in evil.	[]
Stan	1	0	Wow.	[]
Mohammad	19	0	Jesus, come look at this.  After your distress call, we entered David Blaine in the super best friends' computer.	[]
Seaman	36	1	Many interesting things showed up. He was raised in New York city by a decent family, but a freak washing-machine accident at the age of 12 made him learn the ways of the black arts.	['freak']
Buddha	4	0	That's right, Seamen.	[]
Seaman	2	0	Sea Man!	[]
Buddha	7	0	Uh that's what I said. Seamen.	[]
Seaman	2	0	Stop it!	[]
Kyle	5	0	Cartman! Cartman, wake up! Cartman!	[]
Cartman	8	0	No, Paula Poundstone! Leave me alone! Eyuh! Uh?	[]
Kyle	4	0	It's just me.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Brother Kyle? Why do you disturb my rest?	[]
Kyle	13	0	Dude. I don't think I wanna be a part of this anymore.	[]
Cartman	1	0	What?	[]
Kyle	29	0	I think Stan might've been right. Anyway, I think it's going too far. I mean, if I kill myself, it's gonna make my family really sad.	[]
Cartman	20	0	Yeah, I know what you mean. I don't wanna die either.  I haven't even gotten my pubes yet.	[]
Kyle	20	0	I think we should bail. If we leave the group, maybe other people will get the courage to leave, too.	[]
Cartman	33	0	That co- ugh.  That could be difficult, Brother Kyle. But alright, listen: Why don't we sleep on it? If we decide to leave the faction, we can... do it in the morning.	[]
Kyle	13	1	Okay. Okay, you're right.  Oh uh Cartman: thanks.  Cartman?  What the hell?	['hell']
Cartman	10	0	I told on yoo-ou. I told on yoo-ou.	[]
Kyle	5	0	What have you done, Cartman?!	[]
Cartman	8	0	This is for your own good, Brother Kyle.	[]
Blaine	25	0	You must understand, brother Kyle, twah, you know too much about the Church. If you left now, you'd become a danger to our cause.	[]
Cartman	26	0	Ah, and you know what else Kyle said? Um Kyyyle, he said that if we were all gonna commit suicide, that he wouldn't do iiit.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Cartman, you fatass tattle-tale!	[]
Cartman	11	0	At least I'm not the boy in the plastic bubble!	[]
Blaine	14	0	The suicide pact will go as planned. If we die, we all die together.	[]
Narrator	8	0	Meanwhile, at the Hall of Super Best Friends...	[]
Joseph Smith	31	0	Look at that, Jesus. His followers are growing at a rate even faster than mine! It appears this David Blaine is as dangerous as you and your young friend had feared.	[]
Stan	3	0	I knew it.	[]
Jesus	11	0	Here. I have a videotape of his performance the other night.	[]
Joseph Smith	16	0	Perhaps we should have Moses look at the tape and see what he comes up with.	[]
Mohammad	14	0	Moses, scan this tape. Can you tell us the source of Blaine's power?	[]
Moses	4	0	Give me the information.	[]
Stan	3	0	Wow, the Moses.	[]
Moses	27	0	His magic is a combination of centrifugal line and sleight of hand. Wait a minute: I'm picking up movement from Blaintologists from all over the country.	[]
Lao Tse	8	0	The Blaintologists are heading to Washington. But why?	[]
Jesus	17	0	Wait a minute. At his performance David Blaine said something about trying to get tax-exempt status.	[]
Joseph Smith	1	0	Omigod!	[]
Lao Tse	1	0	What?	[]
Joseph Smith	13	0	If he gets tax-exempt status, then he'll become a real religion.	[]
Krishna	4	0	He would become unstoppable	[]
Narrator	18	0	Meanwhile, in the nation's capital, Blaintologists from all over the country have gathered to commit mass suicide!	[]
Blaine	24	0	If the government will not give us tax-exempt status, then we must prove that we are willing to die for our beliefs, twah.	[]
Steven	49	0	Alright, brothers and sisters, gather around.  It's time to drown ourselves in the Reflecting Pool!  However, the-ah Reflecting Pool is a little more shallow than we originally thought, so to drown ourselves, you will need to lie on your stomach, face down, until you die, as such.	[]
Man	1	0	Next!	[]
Narrator	5	0	Meanwhile, at the White House...	[]
Karl Rove	10	0	Mr. President, we can't let them all kill themselves!	[]
George Bush	11	0	Well we can't give them tax-exempt status either, Karl!	[]
Larry	8	0	He-e-ey George! What's gon' on?	[]
Cartman	10	0	Alright, Brother Kyle, it is time for us to die!	[]
Kyle	16	0	Cartman! We've been brainwashed, don't you see? We don't have to do this!	[]
Cartman	11	0	But it's the only way for us to be happy.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Cartman, no!	[]
Blaine	11	0	Give us what we want or we will continue to die	[]
Jesus	5	0	Not so fast, David Blaine!	[]
Blaine	3	0	Jesus! Not again.	[]
Jesus	12	0	Yes! But this time, I've brought some help! Super Best Friends!	[]
Buddha	1	0	Buddha!	[]
Mohammad	1	0	Mohammad!	[]
Joseph Smith	2	0	Joseph Smith!	[]
Krishna	1	0	Krishna!	[]
Lao Tse	2	0	Lao Tse!	[]
Seaman	2	0	Sea-Man!	[]
Jesus	10	0	The mass suicide is over, Blaine! And so are you!	[]
Blaine	7	0	I don't think so. Get them!	[]
Joseph Smith	8	0	My ice breath should take care of you.	[]
Stan	2	0	Kyle! Kyle!	[]
Blaintologist	2	0	Sweet Salvation!	[]
Stan	8	0	Kyle??  Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!	[]
Kyle	2	1	You bastards!	['bastards']
Stan	8	0	Kyle?  Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!	[]
Kyle	2	1	You bastards!	['bastards']
Stan	7	0	Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!	[]
Jesus	5	0	That takes care of them.	[]
Joseph Smith	6	0	Now it's your turn, Blaine!	[]
Blaine	8	0	Perhaps you need to see some real magic.	[]
Lincoln	1	0	Raaargh!	[]
Buddha	5	0	Oh this looks like trouble.	[]
Blaine	5	0	So long, Super Best Fools!	[]
Stan	1	0	Kyle!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Stan!	[]
Stan	6	0	Kyle, you can't kill yourself!	[]
Kyle	15	0	I don't want to kill myself. They rigged this thing to fill with water!	[]
Jesus	11	0	We've gotta stop that oversized Abraham Lincoln! Mohammad!  Great Scott!	[]
Cartman	7	0	Bliegh!  Yugh. Uh, okay, try again. Hep .	[]
Mohammad	5	0	It is too powerful, Jesus!	[]
Krishna	6	0	It seems to have no weakness!	[]
Jesus	12	0	There has to be a way to destroy it.  Jesus to Moses!	[]
Narrator	7	0	Meanwhile, at the Super Best Friends League...	[]
Jesus	3	0	Come in, Moses!	[]
Moses	1	0	What?	[]
Jesus	12	0	We need to know how to kill a giant stone Abraham Lincoln.	[]
Moses	11	0	...Um... Let me think, um... a giant stone John Wilkes Booth?	[]
Jesus	17	0	You heard him, Super Best Friends! We've got to make a giant stone John Wilkes Booth!	[]
Mohammad	10	0	Krishna, we're going to need wood for a mold!	[]
Krishna	4	0	Form of... a beaver!	[]
Mohammad	15	0	I will find sources to concrete.  You, get the water to mix it with, Seaman.	[]
Narrator	21	0	Using the wood that Krishna cut down as a beaver, Jesus uses his master carpentry skills to make a giant mold.	[]
Jesus	9	0	That should do the trick. Now for some concrete.	[]
Narrator	14	0	Meanwhile, in the ocean depths, Seaman seeks out water to mix with the concrete.	[]
Seaman	15	0	Sea-Man!  Look, Swallow, we should be able to divert the water with that pipe.	[]
Narrator	10	0	And so, Seaman and Swallow get to... get to work	[]
Stan	10	0	Kyle, you have to hold your breath!  Oh, very funny!	[]
Jesus	6	0	Lao Tse, bring it to life.	[]
Narrator	16	0	Using his power of Taoism, Lao Tse becomes one with the giant stone John Wilkes Booth.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Wagh.	[]
Jesus	14	0	It worked. Now freeze over the pool so no one else can drown themselves!	[]
Cartman	8	0	Hey, I was just about to do it.	[]
Narrator	6	0	Later, at exactly the same location...	[]

Stan	81	0	Listen up, everyone!  You don't need David Blaine to tell you how to live. See, cults are dangerous because they promise you hope, happiness and, maybe even an afterlife. But in return, they demand you pay money. Any religion that requires you to pay money in order to move up and... learn its tenets is wrong. See, all religions have something valuable to teach, but, just like the Super Best Friends learned, it requires a little bit of them all.	[]
Blaintologist	7	0	He's right. He... he's right!	[]

Narrator	25	0	And so, Jesus and his companions leave Washington. But their return is assured, for there will always be a need for... the Super Best Friends!	[]
