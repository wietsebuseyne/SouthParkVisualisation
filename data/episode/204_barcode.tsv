Kyle	11	0	Yeah. Stan said they're having them over for dinner tonight.	[]
Sheila	8	0	Oh, God. Poor Sharon. Doesn't she know?	[]
Kyle	3	0	Know what, Ma?	[]
Ike	2	0	Muff cabbage!	[]
Sheila	9	0	Never invite a New Jersey housewife in your home.	[]
Teresa	31	3	And so then I met the school principal. What's her name? Principal Victoria? What a stupid bitch! I mean, excuse my language, but that bitch needs her fuckin' head examined!	['bitch', 'bitch', 'fuckin']
Teresa	27	0	Yeah, so my family and I moved from Jersey to South Park about a week ago. So far, I can tell that everyone here really likes me.	[]
Teresa	11	0	Oh! And I met that Stotch woman. What's her name?	[]
Sharon	3	0	Oh, Linda, huh?	[]
Teresa	67	1	Have you noticed how yellow that bitch's teeth are? You can tell that woman is a piece of garbage. She's garbage!  I went into the mall here and I just about dropped dead. The only panties you can buy makes you look like you have a grandma muff! Where's the Gucci? Where's the Prada? Have they heard of Italian clothes? It's ridiculous!	['bitch']
Joe	13	0	So Randy, what gyms are good around here? Where do you work out?	[]
Randy	6	0	I don't really work out.	[]
Joe	10	0	Well, I gotta find somethin'.  My biceps are goin' flat.	[]
Teresa	42	1	Where can you get good clothes in this town?! Nowhere! I mean, that's why you're stuck wearing garbage like that, right? And the woman that works the hair salon? Julia? Have you seen how big that bitch's ears are?	['bitch']
Sharon	8	0	Oh, Julia's a friend of mine, yeah.	[]
Teresa	42	0	Ears out to here!  So I tell her, You got big ears, sweetie. I'm not trying to be mean. It's just a Jersey thing. Why be offended? I mean, you've got a big chin. We've all got imperfections.	[]
Sharon	10	0	Right, just like your eyes are kind of far apart.	[]
Teresa	24	0	That was totally uncalled for, for what she did. My eyes are too far apart? And like who is she? Is she God? No.	[]
Teresa	49	6	You don't ever, ever! You whack job, prostitution...  ...whore! You probably sell your muff...  ...for six dollars! You fucking psycho bitch! Fuck you!  You're nothin' but garbage!  That's what you are! You're garbage!  You sick, old woman! Muff garbage!  Muff cabbage! Fuck this psycho bitch!	['whore', 'fucking', 'bitch', 'fuck', 'fuck', 'bitch']

Joe	3	0	Take it easy.	[]
Teresa	6	0	I love you.  I love you.	[]
Teresa	44	0	I thought I was gonna deck her. I was fine. I was really fine. I just wanted to get my point across to her, and then that's how I am.  Like I could be mad one minute and then I'll be fine.	[]
Teresa	22	0	Okay, all better. Just had to get that out. It's just... it's a Jersey thing. So, who wants dessert? Me!	[]
Stan	46	1	You guys do not understand. Having neighbors from Jersey is the worst! All night long they keep me awake! They're either screaming at each other or making some disgusting sex sounds. It seems like all people from Jersey do is hump and punch each other!	['sex']
Cartman	24	1	You know what you do when you want a family to move away? Every night, you go and take a crap on their doorstep.	['crap']
Kyle	11	1	Is that why there's crap on my doorstep every morning?	['crap']
Cartman	2	0	Oops, busted.	[]
Stan	33	1	They talk way too loud, they flip out for no reason, and every time they act like selfish assholes, they just go, Oh, it's a Jersey thing. It's a Jersey thing.	['assholes']
Jersey Man	12	0	Hey, you talkin' 'bout Jersey? Me and my friends are from Jersey.	[]
Cartman	7	1	Aw, crap, there's more of them?	['crap']
Jersey Man	15	0	'Ey, come on, there's people from Jersey all over! Who here is from Jersey?	[]
"Steve "Last Call""	30	0	So I'm like standin' there, and I'm like, Who's from Jersey?, and people are all like, Yo! Woo-hoo! Next thing you know, Jersey party at Sizzler.	[]
Woman	7	0	Yeah, let's get this party started.	[]
Kyle	7	1	Where the hell are they coming from?!	['hell']
Teresa	6	1	Danielle was being a stupid bitch.	['bitch']
Woman 1	6	0	Shut up, Teresa. You're pathetic!	[]
Teresa	24	0	I'm pathetic? You're muff gabbage!  Oh, Sharon!  Hi, sweetie. You gotta meet our new neighbors. This is Jacqueline. She's from Jersey.	[]
Jacqueline	2	0	And Sicilian.	[]
Teresa	11	0	That's Danielle. She's from Jersey.  And that's Caroline.	[]
Caroline	11	0	I'm having my face shaved. It's a Jersey thing.	[]
Salon Girl	15	0	I'm sorry, but I have other clients in ten minutes. Can you sit down?	[]
Jacqueline	17	1	When the salon girl told Teresa to sit down, I thought Teresa was gonna bust a tit.	['tit']
Teresa	14	1	Don't you fuckin' tell me what to do! I'm a client here!	['fuckin']
Caroline	3	0	Teresa! Calm down.	[]
Salon Girl	12	1	I don't have to take your shit! I'm from Jersey!	['shit']
Teresa	3	0	Get her, Sharon!	[]
Sharon	1	0	What?	[]
Jacqueline	6	0	Sharon, just stay out of it!	[]
Caroline	5	0	Be the bigger person, Sharon!	[]
Sharon	4	0	You people are crazy.	[]
Caroline	13	0	Who's crazy? Are you talkin' about my family?!  Is my family crazy?!	[]
Teresa	10	1	Don't you pull my friend's hair, you bitch!	['bitch']
Sheila	8	0	Let go of her, you piece of trash!	[]
Teresa	11	1	Who the fuck are you to tell me what to do?!	['fuck']
Sheila	14	2	All you trashy whores get the fuck out of here and leave her alone!	['whores', 'fuck']
Teresa	2	1	Psycho bitch!	['bitch']
Sheila	30	6	No! You're a psycho bitch, psycho bitch! Psycho bitch! You wanna see fuckin' crazy?! You'd better just step the fuck away or you're gonna see fuckin' crazy!	['bitch', 'bitch', 'bitch', 'fuckin', 'fuck', 'fuckin']
Jacqueline	3	0	You're cabbage!	[]
Sharon	1	0	Sheila?	[]
Randy	48	0	People of South Park! We have all noticed a steep rise in everything Jersey lately. As many of you already know, everything east of the Rockies is now part of New Jersey! The Jersey Shore now includes Jacksonville, Miami, the Gulf of Jersey Mexico, and the Jersey Islands.	[]
Mr. Garrison	6	0	Jesus! Why are they doing this?	[]
Randy	24	0	More people from Jersey are showing up in our town! If we don't do something, South Park is going to become West Jersey.	[]
Jimbo	17	0	Well, that does it! Let's go tell everyone from Jersey we don't want 'em here!	[]
All	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Sheila	35	0	That won't work. You can't just tell people from Jersey you don't like them. No matter how obnoxious they are, they will convince themselves that you all actually think they're cool.	[]
Jimbo	7	0	How do you know that, Ms. Broflovski?	[]
Sheila	101	1	That's when I knew I had to tell everyone the truth: that originally I'm from Jersey.  Yes, born and raised, I wasn't even called Sheila back then. In Jersey I was known as S-Woww Tittybang.  I drank heavily and punched a lot of bitches in the face.  Living in South Park, I'm able to control the Jersey side of me, which doesn't really come out unless I get around other people from Jersey.  I'm just really hoping that people here don't judge me for it, or, somehow, you know, hold it against me.	['bitches']
Sharon	6	0	Sheila, who are you talking to?	[]
Sheila	9	0	You wouldn't understand. It's a Jersey thing.	[]
Cartman	8	0	You ain't gettin' by that way, Kenny!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Hey, dudes.	[]
Cartman	26	0	Oh, well, well, well. Look what the cat threw up in the litter box. Come on, guys. We don't wanna be seen hanging around him.	[]
Kyle	5	0	What are you talking about?	[]
Cartman	10	0	Dude, we heard the news! Your mom is from Jersey!	[]
Kyle	2	0	So what?	[]
Cartman	7	0	So what?! That makes you from Jersey!	[]
Kyle	4	0	No, it doesn't!	[]
Cartman	13	0	He's from Jersey, you guys.  Let's just get away from him.	[]
Kyle	9	0	I'm not from Jersey. I was born here.	[]
Cartman	20	0	Don't try and deny it! You're one of them, dude. And by my account, that's strike three!	[]
Kyle	4	0	What's strike three?!	[]
Cartman	15	2	You're a ginger, a Jew, and from Jersey! Three strikes, Kyle! You're out!	['ginger', 'jew']
Kyle	5	1	Shut the fuck up!  What?	['fuck']
Stan	8	0	Did you know your mom was from Jersey?	[]
Kyle	4	0	Why does it matter?!	[]
Stan	7	0	No, uh, it just explains a lot.	[]
Cartman	19	0	Oh, my God! Kyle is even starting to look like he's from Jersey! His skin is turning orange!	[]
Kyle	4	0	No, it isn't!	[]
Cartman	7	0	Yes, it is. It's getting oranger.	[]
Stan	17	1	Stop it, Cartman. Just 'cause Kyle's mom is a Jersey asshole doesn't mean Kyle is.	['asshole']
Kenny	1	0	(Yeah.)	[]
Cartman	43	1	Okay, you do what you want, guys. As for me, well, you're a heartless backstabbing Jersey boy, Kyle, and I shan't be playing basketball with the likes of you.  And I'm gonna start crappin' on your doorstep a lot more!	['crappin']
Kyle	7	0	No.  Couldn't be.  Oh, my God.	[]
Sheila	4	0	Kyle? You in there?	[]
Kyle	10	0	Hold on. Ah, I'm, ah... n-not right now.	[]
Sheila	4	0	Kyle, open the door.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Not now, Mom. Please.	[]
Sheila	5	0	Kyle, this instant! One, two.	[]
Kyle	4	0	All right, all right.	[]
Sheila	6	0	I guess we need to talk.	[]
Sheila	11	0	I know this has to be very upsetting for you, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	4	0	What am I, Mom?	[]
Sheila	66	0	When I got pregnant with you, Kyle, your father and I were living with my parents in Newark. We knew we had to get out. Neither of us wanted our child to be from Jersey, so we moved. As far away as we could. But now I realize you can take the fetus out of Jersey, but you can't take Jersey out of the fetus.	[]
Kyle	4	0	What are you saying?!	[]
Sheila	24	0	I'm saying that for the first two months I carried you in my stomach, I lived in Newark. Technically, you are from Jersey.	[]
Kyle	8	0	No! I don't wanna look like this!	[]
Sheila	16	0	It isn't so bad, Kyle. A lot of people think the Jersey look is nice.	[]
Ike	1	0	Aaaahhhhh!	[]
Kyle	16	0	I can hide it!  Nobody ever has to know!  I can't ever let anybody know!	[]
Announcer	18	0	Live from St. Louis, New Jersey! It's the Jersey News with anchormen P-Train and Tan Jovi!	[]
P-Train	43	0	What's up, New Jersey? It's the evenin' news. Our top story tonight: many Jersey people are freakin' pissed after a small town in Colorado got all aggro on some decent Jersey folk! For more on this story we go to Chicago.	[]
Reporter	78	0	People here in Chicago, New Jersey are riled up, P-Train. Apparently, a town called South Park, which is at the border of Denver, New Jersey, is discriminating against people from Jersey! They won't sell houses to people from Jersey, and they're making all the ones who moved in move out.  And they're takin' down all the Jersey-owned shops!  It's like these people got a beef with Jersey. What's up with that?!	[]
Tan Jovi	5	0	What's up with that?!	[]
P-Train	5	0	What's up with that?!	[]
Tan Jovi	16	0	Well, we are coming after you, South Park! We fight discrimination! It's a Jersey thing!	[]
Randy	29	0	Please, Governor. You have to send your troops to join us in this fight. We're just a small town. We can't stop New Jersey on our own.	[]
Schwarzenegger	13	0	We are very sorry, but California cannot afford helping you at this time.	[]
Randy	14	0	Can't you see that if we fall to New Jersey, California is next?	[]
Schwarzenegger	8	0	No, because Utah is between Colorado and California.	[]
Randy	14	0	Oh. Fine! But when Utah gets taken over by New Jersey, who's next?!	[]
Schwarzenegger	1	0	Nevada.	[]
Randy	10	0	Oh, really? Well, okay, Mr. I'm-Awesome-at-Geography!	[]
Cartman	7	1	What the hell are you guys doing?!	['hell']
Stan	11	0	Tryin' to help. My dad says to distribute all these guns.	[]
Cartman	21	0	And we're just gonna let him stand around here?! He's one of them. He could even be a spy!	[]
Kyle	23	0	I told you Cartman, I'm not one of them! I don't wanna live in West Jersey any more than you do!	[]
Cartman	7	0	Overcompensating a little, aren't we, Kyle?!	[]
Kyle	3	0	That's enough!	[]
Cartman	15	2	Your blood is tainted with the three J's! Jewish, Jersey and Ginger! Admit it!	['jewish', 'ginger']
Kyle	44	2	Aaaarrghhhhhh!  I'm not one of them! Do you understand me?! You'd better get that through your fat head! I will never be one of them, and if you say it again, I swear to God, I'll smash your fucking teeth in!	['fat', 'fucking']
Cartman	37	0	That hurt my throat because he pushed it right here, and then the back of my head hit the tree! There was... there was... there was bark, and it scratched it!  Did you see the scratch, Kenny?!	[]
Randy	37	0	Please, Emperor Akishino! We need Japan's help to fight these people!  Fine! But you Japs will all be eatin' hoagies in a month!  That's it, nobody's gonna help us! We're on our own!	[]
Stuart	13	0	We can't take on all of Jersey. We have to find support.	[]
Randy	29	0	There is no support! Every ally America ever had is...  Wait a minute.  Sometimes when a threat is great enough, you have to turn to your enemies for help.	[]
Mr. Garrison	5	0	What are you talking about?	[]
Randy	5	0	We could ask Al Qaeda.	[]
Stephen	11	0	Ask Al Qaeda for help? After what they did to us?!	[]
Randy	12	0	Maybe it's time we put our differences aside and forgive them.	[]
Stephen	20	1	And what about the families of the victims of 9/11? Their feelings matter for another ten months, damn it!	['damn']
Bar Patron 1	20	0	Hey! Hey, we got a problem! You've gotta get some people down to the bad quick! There's trouble!	[]
Randy	3	0	People from Jersey?	[]
Bar Patron 1	9	1	I don't know what the hell I saw.	['hell']
Skeeter	14	0	It tore a hole in my meat locker. Smashed a cigarette machine in half.	[]
Barbrady	9	0	Alright, come out now. Make it easy on yourself.	[]
Bar Patron 2	11	0	It's one of them! That thing's from Jersey, too!	[]
Randy	3	0	What is it?	[]
Bar Patron 2	9	0	It's called a Snooki. It's very famous.	[]
Randy	5	0	That thing is famous? Why?	[]
Bar Patron 2	4	0	I don't know!	[]
Jimbo	10	0	Well, what are we waitin' for? Let's kill it!	[]
Snooki	1	0	Snooki.	[]
Randy	12	0	Don't let it get away! Where is it?!  Who was that?!	[]
Stephen	6	0	Aaagh! Get it off of me!	[]
Snooki	2	0	Snooki smoosh.	[]
Stephen	2	0	Shoot it!	[]
Cartman	32	0	So then he grabs my throat, right? And he slams my head into a tree! And then he screams, I'll smash your teeth in! My head is all like gashed open.	[]
Butters	5	0	Kyle did that? Gee whiz.	[]
Cartman	60	0	I'm telling you guys, he's getting worse. The Jersey in Kyle is coming out. I don't see any other choice. We have to kidnap Kyle and lock him in the meat freezer at Sizzler.  Hey, Kyle. 'Sup? Kind of nice out tonight, huh?  He has to be put away, and he has to be put away now!	[]
Butters	4	0	Are you being serious?	[]
Cartman	5	0	This is very serious, Butters.	[]
Butters	13	0	Yeah, but lockin' Kyle in a meat freezer? I mean, he could die.	[]
Cartman	43	1	Well if he does, too bad! Did you see the scratch on my head?!  Hey, Kyle.  Uhh. Dude, do you smell raspberries? I smell raspberries. Ho? Huh.  We need to do this now. At some point, he might start suspecting something's up.	['ho']
Operative	2	0	Istagia makuman?	[]
Randy	100	0	Hello, Mr. bin Laden. My name is Randy, and I'm a geologist in America. I know that America isn't your favorite place in the world, but gosh darn it, we need your help. As you may know, we are trying to stop our entire country from becoming New Jersey. I believe that if we do not succeed, Jersey will spread to Japan, Russia, and eventually, to you. I know you have seen countless horrors in your lifetime, Mr. bin Laden, and that you have witnesses the very worst of mankind. Well, now I ask you to watch this.	[]
Snooki	5	0	Neaaaaaah! Snooki wants smoosh smoosh.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Come on, you guys, hurry!	[]
Stan	9	1	Cartman, what the hell are we doing at Sizzler?	['hell']
Cartman	14	0	I told you guys, you're not gonna believe it. It's a miracle!	[]
Kenny	5	1	(What kind of fuckin' miracle?!)	['fuckin']
Cartman	23	0	Jesus answered our prayers, you guys. It's so cool.  It's right there in the meat locker. Kyle, go check it out.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Why?	[]
Cartman	9	0	Dude, go see why. It's a Jesus miracle!	[]
Kyle	15	0	You just wanna lock me in there because you think I'm one of them.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Nuh uh. Seriously, nuh uh.	[]
Kyle	13	0	I'm not going in any meat locker so you can trap me!	[]
Cartman	22	0	Trap you? No, no, Kyle, it's actually... lights!  Ha-ha! It's a trap, Kyle! Get him to the meat locker!	[]
Stan	5	0	Dude, what are you doing?	[]
Cartman	20	0	Back away, guys, this is for the safety of all of us.  Sorry Kyle, but you can't be trusted.	[]
Kyle	21	0	All right, fine, Cartman! You really want me to go in there, I'll...  Dude, Cartman, what is that behind you?	[]
Cartman	9	0	Kyle, do we really have to resort to that?!	[]
Kyle	9	0	No, I'm serious. What is that behind you?	[]
Cartman	11	2	You ginger Jersey Jew!  Your tactics don't work on me!	['ginger', 'jew']
Snooki	4	0	Snooki wants smoosh smoosh.	[]
Cartman	9	1	Dude, what the fuck is that thing behind me?	['fuck']
Stephen	11	0	Garrison, I think the Jersey people are advancing. Where's Randy?	[]
Mr. Garrison	7	0	He's still questioning that new prisoner.	[]
Randy	14	0	Alright, Mr. Situation, we'll try this again! Why are you people doing this?!	[]
The Situation	11	0	Well, I told you, it's, uh, just a Jersey thing.	[]
Randy	4	0	What does that mean?!	[]
The Situation	15	0	You just don't understand. It's, uh, it's just... just a Jersey thing.	[]
Randy	3	0	Stop playing stupid!	[]
Jimbo	6	0	Maybe he really is stupid, Randy.	[]
Randy	9	0	Nobody's this stupid!  What are you people planning?!	[]
The Situation	18	0	It's just a Jersey thing, you know? You...you just gotta be from Jersey to get it.	[]
Gerald	3	0	Here they come!	[]
Sharon	4	0	Is it them, Randy?	[]
Randy	6	0	Yup. They're from Jersey alright.	[]
Jersey People	7	0	Yeah! Woo-hoo! Let's go! Yeah!	[]
Jersey Man 2	7	0	Let's go creepin' in this town!	[]
Jersey Woman	14	0	Don't you talk about my family! Don't you talk about my family!	[]
Randy	14	0	This is where we make our stand! South Park will never be West Jersey!	[]
Randy	11	1	Fuck New Jersey!  Keep shooting! We're sick of you, Jersey!	['fuck']
DogPoo	12	0	Ugh! Ugh! Get it off of me! Get it off of me!	[]
Snooki	4	0	Snooki wants smoosh smoosh.	[]
Stan	7	0	Try to find a way past it!	[]
Cartman	4	0	What does it want?!	[]
Butters	6	0	Sounds like it wants smoosh smoosh.	[]
Snooki	6	0	Smoosh smoosh. Snooki wants smoosh smoosh.	[]
Cartman	11	0	No! You guys, it's raping me! It's raping me!	[]
Stan	8	1	Jesus Christ, what the hell do we do?	['hell']
Kyle	8	0	Oh, God.  Wuh. Aah. Get out of here!	[]
Stan	1	0	Why?	[]
Kyle	3	0	Agggh! Agggh!  No!	[]
Stan	1	0	Dude.	[]
Kyle	15	0	Get out of here, you piece of garbage! You wanna smoosh, go creepin' somewheres else!	[]

Randy	10	0	Then we've got to start falling back to Utah!	[]
Stuart	11	0	What's the point? Can't you see it's over?	[]
Jimbo	3	0	Who is that?!	[]
Randy	9	1	It's Al Qaeda!  Give 'em hell, Al Qaeda!	['hell']
Randy	59	0	On a cold October night, a small town in Colorado stood up to New Jersey and finally said, Go away! Our fortitude was the inspiration for others and now, New Jersey is slowly receding back to the desolate land from whence it came. Our country's getting back to normal, and we owe it all to Osama bin Laden.	[]
Stan	10	0	Well, Kyle, looks like you're totally back to normal.	[]
Kyle	15	0	Yeah. The more distance between me and the others from Jersey, the better I feel.	[]
Cartman	26	0	Yeah, but you still have it in you. You saved my life, Kyle. Deep down inside, you're a monster.  But you're my little monster.	[]
Stan	18	0	I just have one question, Kyle. At Sizzler when you were yelling Muff cabbage, what's muff cabbage?	[]
Kyle	9	0	It's a, uh, it's a Jersey thing.	[]
Randy	20	0	On this day let us all remember that no people on this earth are really enemies, only folks with differences.	[]
Paratrooper	6	0	Tango is down, tango is down.	[]
Randy	3	0	We got him!	[]
