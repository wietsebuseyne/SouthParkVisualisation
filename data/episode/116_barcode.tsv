Kyle	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Chef	8	0	All right. Now, where did you get served?	[]
Stan	37	0	Over at the True Value parking lot. There were just these kids we never saw before showed up and they were like, really good dancers and, we don't really understand what it means, but I guess-	[]
Chef	86	0	Okay okay, relax children. Relax. It's all over now. Just try to calm down and sit tight.  I'm gonna call your parents and let them know you're okay.  Mrs. Marsh? Hi, it's Chef. Yeah, I'm good. Listen: Stan and his friends just got served. Yeah. Yeah, over at the True Value. No no, he's fine. They're all fine. Yeah, it was some kids from out of town.

Stan	1	0	No.	[]
Randy	12	0	What? Yo-you got served and just stood there and took it?	[]
Sharon	7	0	That was the right thing to do.	[]
Randy	27	1	No, that's crap, Sharon. Stanley, when somebody challenges you to dance, you have to dance back at them, or else they'll think you're weak.	['crap']
Stan	11	0	But Dad, I don't know how to dance or nothin'.	[]
Randy	20	0	Well then, it's about time you learned!  Put on some loose-fitting clothes and meet me in the garage!	[]
Stan	2	0	But Dad-	[]
Randy	1	0	Now!	[]
Randy	48	0	All right son, dancing is all about a frame of mind. Now, I'm not telling you to go around challenging other kids to dance, but when they challenge you, you just look 'em straight in the eye, and give 'em this.  Come on, Stan.  ...six, seven, eight.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Dude, that is a sweet RC car!	[]
Stan	8	0	Yeah, let's go race it right now!	[]

Stan	6	0	I thought I was supposed to!	[]
Chef	13	0	Now you've gotta compete against them in the dance competition on Saturday!	[]
Stan	2	0	But why?	[]
Chef	18	0	Because if you get served and served them back, then it's on! Don't you know anything??	[]
Sharon	12	0	Well, nice going, Randy! Really great advice you gave our son here!	[]
Randy	1	0	What?	[]
Sharon	12	0	Those kids showed up to serve Stan again and he danced back!	[]
Randy	3	0	So what happened?	[]
Sharon	3	0	It's on!	[]
Coach	13	0	Come on now, keep it tight!  Good. Now watch that timing, drill team!	[]
OC Member 1	2	0	All right!	[]
OC Girl	2	0	All right!	[]
OC Leader	3	1	Yeah, bad ass!	['ass']
OC Member 2	4	0	Yeah, that was tight!	[]
Coach	5	0	Not bad, kids. Not bad.	[]
OC Member 1	9	0	Not bad? South Park doesn't stand a chance!	[]
OC Girl	3	0	I heard that!	[]
Coach	14	0	All right, it was good. But we don't want good, we want pain!	[]
Randy	5	0	Uh, hey, ex- excuse me.	[]
Coach	1	0	Yeah?	[]
Randy	15	0	Hi, uh, my name is Randy Marsh. I'm I'm Stan Marsh's father.	[]
Coach	20	0	Oh, so you're the father of the boy who's gonna get f'd in the a on Saturday?	[]
OC Member 3	1	0	Dang!	[]
OC Leader	1	0	Oooooo!	[]
Randy	42	0	Uh, listen. Uh, it was my fault that Stanley served your boys the other day. Uh, I told him to do it and I... We- well look I, I just came down here to tell you... it-  it- it's not on.	[]
Coach	4	0	Oh, it's on!	[]
Randy	7	0	No, no, no, it's not on.	[]
Coach	6	0	Whoo, it's on all right!	[]
Randy	10	0	It isn't on. Nothing's on. It's off.	[]
Coach	3	0	It's on!	[]
Randy	25	0	I'm keeping my son home Saturday. I just came by to let you know so you can... put a stop to all this. Goodbye.	[]
Coach	68	0	Hold on a second, clam-head!  You think you can just roll in here and tell us it's not on when it very clearly is on?! You're just trying to make us not practice, aren't you?! Because you know that your kids are goin' down when my kids give them this! Give me some moves out, Girl T!  Check this out!  Yeah! You like that?!	[]
OC Leader	2	0	Oooo man!	[]
OC Member 1	2	0	Ohhh Lord!	[]
OC Leader	5	0	Oooo, he is gettin' served!	[]
Randy	4	0	Aw, mph! Uuuugh-ah.	[]
Sharon	5	0	Randy?  Randy, oh my God!	[]
Skeeter	5	0	What happened to him, Doctor?	[]
Dr. Doctor	8	0	He got served. Worst I've ever seen.	[]
Jimbo	22	0	Old fool went down to the OC to try to reason with the other team, and he got served up somethin' fierce.	[]
Chef	2	0	Oh Lord...	[]
Randy	19	0	His dancing was so fast I... couldn't do anything. His moves were... so original, so inventive.  Ungh! Grrgh.	[]
Nurse	4	0	Shh. Relax, Mr. Marsh.	[]
Dr. Doctor	33	0	We just got the X-rays back.  He mostly got served here  and here . But the worst serving was here in the pelvis region. The road to recovery will be a long one.	[]
Jimbo	15	0	Boy. You must really wanna take to to those Orange County kids now, huh, Stan?	[]
Skeeter	18	0	Are you kiddin'? Stan is probably ready to pounce on them after what they did to his father!	[]
Stan	9	0	I, I don't know. He seems all right.	[]
Mr. Garrison	22	1	I could only imagine the rage building inside you, Stan. I bet you can't wait to out-dance those OC bastards!	['bastards']
Randy	2	0	Stan? Stan?	[]
Stan	8	0	Yeah, I'm- I'm right here, Dad.	[]
Randy	21	0	Stan, listen to me. I don't want you feeling like you have to do that competition now to avenge me.	[]
Stan	2	0	Okay, good.	[]
Randy	24	2	But I know I can't stop you from doing it. So all I can say is... give 'em hell, son. Give 'em hell.	['hell', 'hell']
Stan	2	1	God dammit!	['dammit']
Stan	10	0	Hey guys. Uh- You guys know how to dance, right?	[]
Michael	7	0	Of course we know how to dance.	[]
Stan	43	1	Cool, because, there's this competition on Saturday, and I have to find the very best dancers in South Park to be on my crew. My friends can't do it because they suck ass, so, will you be in my dance troupe?	['ass']
Pete	23	0	Dance troupe? Please.  We don't dance like those Britney and Justin wannabes at school.  Goth kids dance to express pain and suffering.	[]
Michael	33	0	Yeah.  The only cool way to dance is to keep your hands at your sides and your eyes looking at the ground. Then every three seconds you take a drag from your cigarette.	[]
Stan	24	0	Okay, that'll work fine. Listen, there's a dance competition this Saturday and I need good dancers so I don't get served.	[]
Pete	16	0	No way. Dancing is something you do alone in your room at three in the morning.	[]
Stan	17	0	Please, you guys, our whole town's reputation is at stake! Will any of you do it?	[]
Pete	13	0	I'm not doin' it. Being in a dance group is totally conformist.	[]
Henrietta	10	0	Yeah. I'm not conforming to some dance-off regulations.	[]
Firkle	13	0	I'm not doin' it either. I'm the biggest nonconformist of all.	[]
Michael	22	0	I'm such a nonconformist that I'm not going to conform with the rest of you. Okay, I'll do it.	[]
Stan	1	0	Great!	[]
Henrietta	10	0	Whoa. I think we just got put in our place.	[]
Pete	6	0	Yeah. We just got Goth-served.	[]
Stan	11	0	All right, we gotta find three other kids that can dance.	[]
Michael	6	0	We should go to the arcade.	[]
Stan	2	0	The arcade?	[]
Michael	18	0	Yeah. There's this Asian kid name Yao. He's an expert at that Dance Dance Revolution game.	[]
Stan	4	0	Dude, he's incredible.	[]
Michael	27	0	He should be. He's here playing that game every single day after school. I think he's spent about six thousand dollars on it so far.	[]
Stan	15	0	Hey kid, you're pretty good. How would you like to join our dance troupe?	[]
Yao	11	0	You mean, dancing without a machine telling you what to do?	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Yao	3	0	That's stupid.	[]
Stan	4	0	Dude, we need you.	[]
Yao	7	0	I can't dance without the machine.	[]
Stan	11	0	It's all right. My friend Chef is gonna coach us.	[]
Yao	7	0	Okay. I'll give it a shot.	[]
Stan	5	0	All right, that's three!	[]
Michael	5	0	Dude, we need a girl.	[]
Stan	1	0	Huh?	[]
Michael	16	1	We can't be a dance troupe with just guys. People will think we're fags.	['fags']
Stan	11	0	Oh yeah.  Wait a minute. I know just where to go!	[]
Porsche	8	0	Hi guys, welcome to Raisins. Three of you?	[]
Stan	14	0	Ah actually we were just hoping we could talk to you guys real quick.	[]
Maury	13	0	You have to buy wings if you wanna talk to the Raisins girls.	[]
Stan	17	0	And so we're putting all the best dancers in South Park together to beat Orange County.	[]
Mercedes	13	0	Wow, that sounds great. I always wanted to try my dancing somewhere else.	[]
Stan	5	0	So you'll do it?	[]
Mercedes	2	0	Why not?	[]
Stan	8	0	All right, we just need one more person!	[]
Mercedes	13	0	Hey, we should get that kid that was state champion in tap dancing.	[]
Stan	9	0	What? The state tap champion is from here? Who?	[]
Mercedes	9	0	I think his name was...  Leopold... Stotch or something?	[]
Stan	7	0	Leopold Stotch...? Wait a minute. You mean...	[]
Butters	21	0	Loo loo loo, I've got some apples. Loo loo loo, you've got some too. Loo loo loo, I've-	[]
Linda	5	0	Butters, you have some visitors.	[]
Butters	5	0	Oh well, hi there everybody.	[]
Stan	18	0	Butters, listen. There's gonna be a competition this Saturday, and we want you to join our troupe.	[]
Butters	16	0	Wow, neat-o, a competition? Why, I'd love to. What kind of competition is it?	[]
Stan	16	0	It's a dance-off. We heard you were tap dancing state champion two years ago.	[]
Butters	1	0	...No.	[]
Stan	14	0	But, you were, weren't you? Y-you went to the nationals in Nebraska.	[]
Butters	13	0	No.  No no no no no no, no!  No! No no no no!	[]
Linda	2	0	Butters?  Butters?!	[]
Stan	16	0	We just asked him to join our dance troupe. We heard he was state tap champion.	[]
Linda	18	0	Oh. Oh dear. I'm sorry kids, it's just that... Butters hasn't danced since the tragedy.	[]
Mercedes	2	0	A tragedy?	[]
Butters	1	0	Waaaaah!	[]
Linda	9	0	I'm sorry, kids, you'll have to go.	[]
Stan	9	1	Dammit, where are we gonna get our fifth member?	['dammit']
Yao	15	0	Hey I heard about this guy in Como who has a duck that can dance.	[]
Stan	27	0	A duck? Dude, don't be stupid! Those OC kids are professional dancers! Now come on, there's gotta be one other talented person in South Park.	[]
Butters	2	0	Aaaaah!  Aaaaah!	[]
Stan	9	0	All right, so you're sure he can dance?	[]
Rancher	8	0	Oh yeah. There he is. That's Jeffy.	[]
Yao	10	0	That don't look like a dancing duck to me.	[]
Rancher	73	0	Well, that's 'cause it needs music. Here y-here ya go, Jeffy. You'll do a line and I'll do a line, honeeey.You'll do a line and I'll do a line, babe. You'll do a line and I'll do a line, we'll fight an' screw 'til the mornin' time. Honey, babe, be mine. You'll do a line and I'll do a line, honey-	[]
Stan	11	0	Hey, he- Is that the only song he'll dance to?	[]
Rancher	50	0	No no, he'll dance to anything. See? You'll snort K and I'll snort K, honeeey. You'll snort K and I'll snort K, babe. You'll snort K and I'll snort K, we'll fight an' screw all night and day. Honey, babe, be mine.	[]
Stan	10	0	My friends, I think we have ourselves a dance troupe.	[]
Linda	29	0	Butters? Butters? Come on, sweetie, it's gonna be okay.  Come on, Butters. You went through a lot of therapy for this. That was almost two years ago, sweetie.	[]
Butters	6	0	Two years ago. Two years ago!	[]
Announcer	37	0	That was Beverly Long from Indianapolis, folks. Let her hear it!  All right, and now, dancing to the song I've Got Something In My Front Pocket For You, here is Colorado state champion, Leopold Butters Stotch!	[]
Singer	61	0	I've got something in my front pocket for youWhy don't you reach down in my pocket and see what it isThen grab onto it, it's just for youGive a little squeeze and say, How do you do? There's something in my front pocket, There's something in my front pocket, There's something in my front pocket-	[]
Butters	1	0	Whoops.	[]
Woman	2	0	Paul. Paul!	[]
Butters	5	0	Wuuuhaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaah!  No! Nooo! Noooooooooooooooo!	[]
Chef	36	0	All right, children, let's get to rehearsin'!  We don't have much time, and you've got to become the dance group you can be.  I think we should-  Whoa.  This... is the dance troupe?	[]
Stan	10	0	Yeah, dude, the best dancers South Park has to offer.	[]
Chef	22	0	Oh boy.  All right, well, why don't you show me what you got? I wanna see what you kids can do!	[]
Boombox	86	3	You can't step to my roots, so don't try it.You can't burn with my group so don't light it. I'm on the East-side crew and I'm better than you. You like to suck my balls, don't deny it. You can't bop her like me so don't go there. You never find a bigger bitch player nowhere. I put my jimmy in a ho, put off soul. I'm a good listener and that's rare.	['balls', 'bitch', 'ho']
Chef	62	0	Oh Lord have mercy.  Children, children! No no, you've got it all wrong. Don't you see, children? You have the heart, but you don't have the soul. No no, wait. You have the soul, but you don't have the heart.  No no, scratch that. You have the heart and the soul, but you don't have the talent.	[]
Stan	10	0	We're gonna get served on Saturday, aren't we?	[]
Yao	7	0	What? I don't wanna get served.	[]
Mercedes	11	0	Yeah, you didn't tell us that we might get served.	[]
Stan	28	0	Well that was the whole point of the whole thing was that the guys came back and they said we were gonna get served and we were like-	[]
Chef	34	0	All right all right, quiet, children! Now, nobody's getting served if I can help it. We just gotta buckle down, dig deep, and pray that maybe the other team comes down with cancer.	[]
Butters	4	0	What do you want?	[]
Stan	30	0	I came to ask you one more time to join the crew. Everyone is practicing really hard, but... I don't think we have any kind of shot without you.	[]
Butters	12	0	Sorry, Stan, I'm not a dancer anymore.  I gave that up.	[]
Stan	13	0	Your mom says you were one of the best dancers in the country.	[]
Butters	11	0	Did she also tell you my dancing got eight people killed?	[]
Stan	12	0	Yeah. She said your shoe came off. It wasn't your fault	[]
Butters	8	0	Yeah well, you tell that to their families.	[]
Stan	11	0	Look, Butters, accidents happen. We all have to live with that.	[]
Butters	14	0	I let those people down! Don't you get it, man?! Eight people died!	[]
Stan	11	0	Well, it was nine, actually. One of the women was pregnant.	[]
Butters	1	0	What?	[]
Stan	13	0	And eleven if you count the two family members that killed themselves afterward.	[]
Butters	1	0	Aaaah!	[]
Stan	80	0	But that isn't the point, Butters!  The point is that this is now! It's on! And there are people who need you to step up! Look, nobody likes having to rise to a challenge. But competing against other people and getting in their faces saying Haha! I'm better than you! is part of life. And if you can't face that, then you might as well sit here and play Legos until you're an old man.	[]
Butters	6	0	Get out of my room, Stan.	[]
Stan	31	0	Fine.  But someday you're gonna have to stop running from what happened and start dealing with it. Otherwise, you might as well move to France with all the other pussies.	[]
MC	45	0	Yeah, make some noise!  Ladies and Gentlemen,  man, you are all in for a treat! Whichever crew wins tonight, you wanna remember their faces, 'cause the next time you see them... will be in Lil Kim's next video! Give it up for Lil Kim!	[]
Lil Kim	4	1	What's up, niggaz?!	['niggaz']
MC	26	0	This is gonna be a rough battle, y'all. So let's give it up for the OC Crew!  And the challengers, the South Park Diggitys!	[]
