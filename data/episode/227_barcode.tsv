Sheila	57	3	Yes, yes, this whole coming week is the Jewish holiday of Passover. Yes, it's all about how Moses led the Hebrews out of Egypt. Very good! So on Friday, all Jewish people will celebrate Passover with a seder dinner.  Because God commanded the Jews to only eat bread that hasn't been given yeast to rise.	['jewish', 'jewish', 'jews']
Cartman	12	0	Wow, that's so cool. And so then Passover lasts seven days?	[]
Sheila	13	0	Yes, yes, one week from seder dinner on Friday to the next Friday.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Interesting, and why is it called Passover again?	[]
Sheila	17	0	Well, because in ancient Egypt, God passed over the houses marked with the blood of a lamb.	[]
Cartman	3	0	So interesting, wow.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Get out of here.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Oh, hey, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Get. Outta here!	[]
Cartman	14	0	Well, I better be going. Thanks so much Ms. Broflovski, I learned a ton.	[]
Sheila	5	0	Well, you're very welcome.	[]
Kyle	5	0	What are you gonna do?	[]
Cartman	14	1	Isn't it possible I just want to learn more about the Jewish faith?	['jewish']
Kyle	1	0	No?	[]
Cartman	28	0	Alright, Kyle, listen.  Legends tell of a horrific four legged creature from Mexico that sucks the blood of goats, and it might have just spotted in South Park.	[]
Kyle	8	0	What does that have to do with Passover?	[]
Cartman	25	1	All I can promise you is that this is going to be the most memorable Passover ever.  Cartman's Passover Holiday Special, starring, THE JEWPACABRA!	['jewpacabra']
Attendant	10	0	Alright, next please. Signing up for the Easter egg hunt?	[]
Butters	10	0	Hoh da lolly! This is gonna be so much fun!	[]
Craig	7	0	Yeah, I can't wait for Sunday.	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Me, too.)	[]
Cartman	20	1	Yeah, yeah, it should be a real blast, heh. I just hope Jewpacabra doesn't show up, that's all.	['jewpacabra']
Craig	2	1	Jewpa what?	['jewpa']
Cartman	9	1	Jewpaca- look, it's nothing. Forget I said anything.	['jewpaca']
Craig	11	0	Okay.  So anyways, are they saying what time the event starts?	[]
Cartman	34	1	Okay, look: A lot of people claim that on Passover, a blood sucking creature called the Jewpacabra comes out and preys on children. This year passover happens to be the same week as Easter.	['jewpacabra']
Butters	8	0	You mean it's like, like a monster?	[]
Cartman	22	0	It's just a legend, alright?! But people all over town have started reported strange things. Knocked over trash cans, weird howls...	[]
Token	2	0	Nuh-uh!	[]
Cartman	17	0	Yeah-uh, Token! Don't think it won't come after you just because you're black!	[]
Clyde	5	0	You guys, check this out!	[]
Cartman	19	1	Alright, alright, stay back. Stay back! It definitely looks like a Jewpacabra attack, but it's hard to tell.	['jewpacabra']
Butters	1	0	AAAAAAHHH!	[]
Cartman	23	0	Alright guys, we're gonna need some video cameras. We gotta go out at night and try to get proof of this thing.	[]
Kyle	8	0	Alright, alright! Knock it off! Stop spreading lies.	[]
Cartman	20	1	I'm trying to protect people. And why are you so quick to try and cover up Jewpacabra's existence?	['jewpacabra']
Kyle	16	1	I looked on the known species webpage. There's no animal called a 'Jewpacabra' mentioned anywhere.	['jewpacabra']
Cartman	19	0	Well, neither is Bigfoot, Kyle, but there are a lot of people who say they have spotted a Sasquatch.	[]
Kyle	27	1	If someone says they saw a Sasquatch, they are either lying or they are stupid. Now stop lying about a Jewpacabra before stupid people start believing you!	['jewpacabra']
Butters	36	2	Lu lu lu, lu... N-no such thing as J-Jewpacabra. People made it up.  It's -- that's okay. Even if there was a J-Jewpacabra it couldn't get in my r-room anyways.	['jewpacabra', 'jewpacabra']
Cartman	1	0	Butters.	[]
Butters	1	0	AAAAAHHH!	[]
Cartman	14	1	Come on, Butters, you and me are gonna try to catch Jewpacabra on camera.	['jewpacabra']
Butters	6	0	No, it's a school night!	[]
Cartman	34	2	Butters, do you know how many times Jewpacabra has been shot on video? Zee-ro!  I can't do this alone, please. Help me prove to the rest of the world Jewpacabra is real.	['jewpacabra', 'jewpacabra']
Cartman	21	1	Look at these dense trees and brush. Oh yeah, this is exactly the kind of forest Jewpacabra likes to hide in.	['jewpacabra']
Butters	5	1	You think Jewpacabra is here?	['jewpacabra']
Cartman	5	1	Pretty sure Jewpacabra was here.	['jewpacabra']
Butters	7	0	Oh good. Maybe we scared it off?	[]
Cartman	64	2	You can't scare a Jewpacabra, Butters. Don't forget we're dealing with a creature that drinks blood, hides in the night and has absolutely no belief in the divinity of Christ.  Did you hear that? I'm going to try a Jewpacabra mating call now. NO CHRIST! NO CHRIST! I'M REALLY NOT BUYING THIS WHOLE CHRIST THING!  He's here somewhere.	['jewpacabra', 'jewpacabra']
Butters	5	0	Oh God, I'm scared.	[]
Cartman	4	0	JESUS IS A LIE!	[]
Butters	3	0	Eric, stop it!	[]
Cartman	7	0	Shh! Help me call it out, Butters.	[]
Butters	8	0	I'm not saying Jesus is a lie!	[]
Cartman	14	1	Butters, do you wanna catch Jewpacabra on camera or not?!  THERE IS NO CHRIST!	['jewpacabra']
Butters	4	0	Jesus is a lie?	[]
Cartman	9	0	No way Jesus was son of God, huh, Butters?	[]
Butters	11	0	Nope. I don't think... Christ has any basis in reality.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Sh! You hear that?	[]
Butters	2	1	Oh, hamburgers.	['hamburgers']
President	30	0	We started Sooper Foods to give people a place to buy groceries that was fun and safe. We are not canceling our Easter Egg hunt because of some wild story!	[]
Cartman	138	4	I didn't think you would believe me. And that why last night I took it upon myself to go out and try to capture it on video.  What I'm about to show you is the first video ever shot of a Jewpacabra.  And you're the first to see it.  This is just after 8 p.m. First we heard rustling in the bushes. Then a strange, animal-like scurrying sound. That's when we saw, this.  'Kay wait for it, wait for it, wait for it... wait for it... wait for...  right there! Did you see the Jewpacabra? I know, it's so shocking it takes a minute for your brain to process what it's seeing. Watch again.  Wait for it... wait... there!  Jewpacabra. There's a Jewpacabra in South Park. God help us.	['jewpacabra', 'jewpacabra', 'jewpacabra', 'jewpacabra']
Employee 1	5	0	That wasn't a dog?	[]
Cartman	24	0	It was no dog. I was there, I'm telling you this thing had no idea that Jesus Christ had died for our sins.	[]
Employee 2	1	0	What?	[]
Cartman	34	0	I can try to catch it, but I'm going to need all the resources you've got. If this thing isn't contained, your Easter Egg hunt is going to be a bloodbath.	[]
Employee 1	2	0	Mr. Billings?	[]
Mr. Billings	31	1	There's two things that separate Sooper Foods from all the other grocery stores: Fun and safety. What do you think, Peters? What are the chances that this 'Jewpacabra' is real?	['jewpacabra']
Peters	6	0	I'm estimating somewhere around .000000001%.	[]
Mr. Billings	14	0	We can't afford to take that chance. Get this kid whatever he needs.	[]
Mr. Billings	6	0	So where are we heading first?	[]
Cartman	13	0	We need to get to the city of Nassau in the Bahamas, here.	[]
Mr. Billings	2	0	The Bahamas?	[]
Cartman	27	0	That's right. There's a resort near there called 'The Atlantis Hotel and Casino'. They have a water slide there that goes through a shark tank.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Weeeeeee! Oh yes! Oolll! Check it out! Heheyeahehe!	[]
Mr. Billings	3	0	Where to now?	[]
Cartman	25	2	Now we head back to Colorado, here.  We need to get my video of the Jewpacabra into the hands of professionals who can analyze it.	['jewpacabra', 'analyze']
Kyle	10	1	Would you stop scaring everyone with your dumb ass myth!	['ass']
Cartman	36	0	People thought Atlantis was a myth, Kyle, but I was just there. I've explored the depths of Atlantis, and now I'm about to prove a new species exists. I'm a little James Cameron.	[]
Kyle	22	0	These people aren't going to prove anything. To believe any of this you either have to be a liar, or stupid.	[]
Cartman	19	0	These are professional people who go around tracking Sasquatches, Kyle! They aren't liars, and they aren't stupid!	[]
Matt	10	0	Look at its trajectory. It heads directly to the right.	[]
Cliff	17	0	It can't be human it's too low to the ground. What do you think, Bobo?	[]
Bobo	3	0	Bobo thinks scary!	[]
Matt	9	0	It's definitely something. I'm thinking a Sasquatch.	[]
Cliff	9	0	It's not big enough to be a Squatch.	[]
Matt	6	0	So it's a baby Squatch?	[]
Cliff	6	0	That's what I'm thinking.	[]
Cartman	16	1	I've already done my research boys. What you're looking at there is a Jewpacabra.	['jewpacabra']
Matt	1	1	Jewpacabra?	['jewpacabra']
Cartman	15	0	It's like a Sasquatch, only more elusive, more ferocious and a little more greedy.	[]
Bobo	5	1	Oh, Jewpacabra, that sounds scary!	['jewpacabra']
Cliff	22	1	But it makes total sense. If we rule out a human and a baby Sasquatch, Jewpacabra is all we really have left.	['jewpacabra']
Cartman	27	0	Well, I guess that's it. You're going to have to only allow me into the Easter Egg hunt, sir. I'm the only one qualified.	[]
Mr. Billings	7	0	All the kids will be so disappointed.	[]
Bobo	18	0	Whoa, look at this! I just did the heatie thermal thingie to the video! It's all orangie!	[]
Cliff	18	1	But it's supposed to be all yellow-y. My God! This really is proof of a Jewpacabra!	['jewpacabra']
Cartman	5	0	Heh. What do you mean?	[]
Cliff	10	0	We've never seen this before! It really is true!	[]
Cartman	10	0	Well, I mean it could have just been a dog?	[]
Matt	38	0	No it's impossible. Look at the zoomy in. If I drop image of a dog next to it...  That thing is way to big to be a dog. And check out the thermals coming off of it.	[]
Bobo	11	0	That's the thermals. They make a proof and the thermals!	[]
Matt	15	1	That's right, Bobo. Whatever this thing is it's mean and angry as hell.	['hell']
Cartman	14	1	Well, come on guys, it's probably a Jewpacabra but this isn't definitive.	['jewpacabra']
Matt	11	0	I'll tell you one thing, kid, you're pretty brave.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Why?	[]
Cliff	14	0	'Cause you took the video of this thing. It's not gonna like that.	[]
Matt	12	1	If it is a Jewpacabra, he's gonna be coming after you.	['jewpacabra']
Cartman	71	2	There's... no way. No way Jewpacabra is real.  Those, those cryptozoologists don't know what they're talking about. They just... they just gave me a case of the Hebrew jeebies that's all... Eh, eaah.  Hey. Jewpacabra can't be real, right? Tell me again why it can't be real?  I mean, it's impossible that something I made up could turn out to actually exist, huh, Kyle?	['jewpacabra', 'jewpacabra']
Kyle	4	0	What are you doing?	[]
Cartman	34	1	Okay, okay. Even if there was a Jewpacabra, it wouldn't know I was the one who got video of it, huh? How could it know that? It couldn't know that, right? Kyle?	['jewpacabra']
Cartman	29	0	Jesus loves me this I know 'Cause Republicans tell me so Little ones God will protect 'Cause letting kids be harmed is child neglect Everything still clear out there?	[]
Cartman	1	0	Guys?!	[]
Butters	7	0	It's all quiet out front, Eric.	[]
Cartman	16	0	Well, check everywhere! I'm not paying you guys each twenty bucks to scratch your buttholes!	[]
Butters	11	0	He says he's not payin' us to scratch our buttholes.	[]
Cartman	15	0	What? What was that? Butters? Token?!  Oh Jesus Christ! You guys?! Aghgh!  You guys?! GUYS!	[]
Butters	2	0	Hey, Eric.	[]
Cartman	12	1	It's trying to get in! Where the hell are you guys?	['hell']
Butters	11	0	Well, we got scared so we're next door at Wingstreet.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Wingstreet?!	[]
Butters	9	0	Yeah, well it was the closest place to hide.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Dude, I want wings!  Ahghgh!!!  Oh Jesus, it's only you!	[]
Mr. Billings	3	0	Alright, grab him.	[]
Cartman	1	0	HUH?!	[]
Employee 3	15	1	You say the Jewpacabra hunts for anything Easter, and now it's looking for you.	['jewpacabra']
Cartman	6	0	Get me outta here! PLEASE! HEELP!	[]
Mr. Billings	18	1	Look, we're sorry. But if it's you that Jewpacabra wants, we don't have a choice.	['jewpacabra']
Cartman	9	0	OH GOD, IT'S GONNA KILL ME!  What the-?	[]
Mr. Billings	29	0	Just a little blood to try and draw it out. We just can't risk the creature showing up tomorrow. Our entire business is based on fun and safety.	[]
Cartman	6	0	This isn't safe or fun!	[]
Mr. Billings	25	1	Maybe it won't even show up. Maybe we'll all make it out of this okay?  Oh fuck, we better get out of here.	['fuck']
Cartman	10	0	NO! COME BACK! Come back please, this isn't right!	[]
Mr. Billings	58	0	Hello young man. Let me start off by saying Sooper Foods is absolutely not an anti-semitic company.  But... if your people do have a monster creature that feeds on Easter children, we just wanted to let you know there is a sacrifice for it in the park that is totally fun and safe to eat. Thank you.	[]
Cartman	19	0	Kyle! Hey, Kyle!  I know what you're thinking, Kyle. That, like, this is some kind of fitting comeuppance.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Admit you're lying, and I'll let you go.	[]
Cartman	84	2	Oh, of course I was lying, Kyle. There's no Jewpacabra. Now, please, Kyle, it's Easter Eve! And if Jewpacabra smells this blood, I am in a heap of trouble!  No Kyle! No, wait! I'm sorry I couldn't help it! Kyle?! Please I'll give you money! I have lots of money!  Oh God, what am I doing?  I mean, I mean, I don't have any money! I'm totally broke!  Oh God, I am in a heap of trouble.	['jewpacabra', 'jewpacabra']
Cartman	33	1	It's so cool that even though I'm Christian I celebrate Passover too! Yup. I think both holidays are awesome.  I really sympathize with those Jews in Ancient Egypt! I really do!	['jews']
Cliff	4	0	What'dya think, Bobo?	[]
Bobo	12	0	No doubt about it! It's a three foot tall bunny-man!	[]
Matt	15	0	I told you! Bunny people must be a throwback to paleotardic times! Shoot it Bobo!	[]
Bobo	3	0	Bobo shoot it!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Bobo?! Bobo, no!  Wha-	[]
Bobo	7	0	Bobo got it! Bobo got the bunnymaaan!	[]
Matt	3	0	Good shot, Bobo!	[]
Cliff	5	0	Now what do we do?	[]
Matt	13	0	I know. Let's go get a show about it on Animal Planet.	[]
Cliff	14	0	Good idea.  Wait wait wait wait. We're gonna need to take the evidence.	[]
Bobo	15	0	Alright.  I got the evidence right here. The dart gun I shot the bunnyman with.	[]
Matt	6	0	Alright! Come on, let's go!	[]
Cartman	3	0	Ugh... what... where...	[]
Cartman	6	0	Ugh... what?  What's going on?	[]
Man 1	8	0	The plagues! The plagues are upon us! Run!	[]
Cartman	17	0	It's raining frogggggsss!  Kyle! Kyle, my Hebrew friend! Did you see that it's raining frogs?	[]
Kyle	17	0	Yes. It's because the Pharaoh won't give the Hebrews what we want! God is angry.	[]
Cartman	15	0	So God makes it rain frogs? That just seems kind of mean to frogs, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	25	0	That's how God is! And if Pharaoh doesn't give us what we want, next he's gonna kill all Egyptian first born boys!	[]
Cartman	17	0	Wha- Okay, look, I'll talk to the Pharaoh and see if he'll change his mind.	[]
Kyle	14	0	It doesn't matter. Because God is going to harden the Pharaoh's heart!	[]
Cartman	4	0	What does that mean?	[]
Kyle	17	0	It means Jehovah is going to use his powers to keep the Pharaoh from letting us go.	[]
Cartman	28	0	Well that doesn't seem very fair, Kyle. I mean, if God is going to make Pharaoh say no, then why would he punish him for saying no?	[]
Kyle	6	0	That's just how God is.	[]
Cartman	9	1	You're wrong, Kyle! God is not a dick!	['dick']
Cartman	8	0	Daaad, when's it gonna stop raining frogs?	[]
Pharaoh	10	0	It'll be okay, my son. The weather will clear.	[]
Cartman	26	1	But my friend Kyle, he says that the reason we've had all these plagues and stuff because you won't let all the Jews leave.	['jews']
Pharaoh	41	0	It's a complicated political issue, my son. An economic social issue that needs time. We can't let them leave, but is it really all that different from when the north didn't let the confederate states leave the USA?	[]
Cartman	11	0	Wow, that makes sense. Don't think anyone can deny that.	[]
Pharaoh	8	0	Poor frogs. I feel so badly for them.	[]
Cartman	26	0	But dad, my friend Kyle says that if we don't do whatever the Hebrews want us to do, God is gonna kill little Egyptian boys.	[]
Pharaoh	41	0	Hah, I don't think God would do such a thing, little one. No matter what happens, we can't let ourselves believe in the Hebrew version of God. We believe in a just Lord who would never murder innocent children.	[]
Cartman	4	0	I love you, dad.	[]
Pharaoh	9	0	And I love you son. And our love grows.	[]
Cartman	4	0	And our love grows	[]
Both	22	0	And our love grows Like the mighty river of the Nileriver of the Nile See it flow We'll never be apart	[]
Cartman	21	0	Have no fear, for God is near And God loves all his children Huh?  Nooooooo!  Kyle, why? What are you doing?	[]
Kyle	8	0	This is what God told us to do!	[]
Cartman	7	0	No, Kyle! I don't believe you!	[]
Kyle	3	0	You'll see!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Noooo!	[]
Kid 1	5	0	What's happening to us?	[]
Cartman	1	0	Noooooo!	[]
Child	7	0	Mom! Don't let God kill me!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Noooo!	[]
Man 2	8	0	Care for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?!	[]
Cartman	8	0	No! The bread's all flat! No!  Aaaaahhhh!	[]
Pharaoh	7	0	Son! We were wrong! I WAS WRONG!	[]
Cartman	23	1	We were wrong! I'm sorry God I'll be Jewish I promise! Please don't kill me! Don't kill me! Doooo...!	['jewish']
Cartman	8	0	No! No! The bread is all flat! No!	[]
Mr. Billings	58	0	There are two things people think about when they are grocery shopping: Fun and Safety. On this beautiful Easter morning, we are thrilled to give back to he people of South Park who for the third year in a row have made our grocery store number...  4 in fun and number 6 in safety. Let the hunt begin.	[]
Cartman	96	1	I'm alive!  I'm alive, you guys.  I don't know how, but I'm alive!  Can you believe it? It's a miracle.  Listen everybody, last night I almost died. But then a Passover miracle happened. The Jewpacabra passed me over, and by the power of Jehovah I somehow woke up safely in my bed. I learnt a big lesson. It's wrong, guys. Christ didn't die for our sins and God is angry. It's time for us all to stop this Easter ridiculousness, accept Jehovah as our God and deny Christ.	['jewpacabra']
Butters	9	0	Oh, stop trying to ruin Easter, you! You heathen!	[]
Cartman	45	1	Hey guys, listen!  I finally know how you feel, Kyle. Know your religion is right but being laughed at by everyone else. It's so hard for us Jews. But I guess we just have to let stupid people believe what they are gonna believe.	['jews']
Kyle	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Cartman	20	0	I-I know what you're thinking Kyle. But I really do believe in Judaism now. I'm not lying.	[]
Kyle	5	0	I know, you're not.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Kewl, thanks Kyle. Oh, and Kyle... Happy Passover!	[]
Kyle	3	0	Happy Passover, Cartman.	[]
