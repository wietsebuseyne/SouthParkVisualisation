Mark	11	0	Why can't I go to school with the other boys?	[]
Mrs. Cotswolds	1	0	Oooh.	[]
Mr. Cotswolds	9	0	Well, because, son, public schools are inefficient and dangerous!	[]

Mark	24	0	I just feel like I should go to public school, if only for a little while. To see what other little boys are like.	[]

Mr. Cotswolds	3	0	Who was that?	[]
Mrs. Cotswolds	7	0	A little boy wanted to see Rebecca.	[]
Mr. Cotswolds	12	0	Oh no. I told you the spelling bee was a bad idea.	[]
Mrs. Cotswolds	13	0	But the children won, and they were happy to meet the other children.	[]
Mr. Cotswolds	18	0	Yes, but now I think we may have opened a Pandora's box that we can't close!	[]
Mr. Garrison	31	0	Hokay, children, we have a new student joining us from home school. Now, his parents are very worried about his safety, so please don't be too cruel to him. Mark?	[]
Mark	5	0	Hey, guys. What's up?	[]
Cartman	14	0	Dude, what's wrong with you? You got some kind of John Travolta disease?	[]
Mr. Garrison	42	0	Alright, children, let's just try to pretend there isn't a little boy in a huge plastic hamster ball here, and go on with our studies. Now, who can tell me when Columbus sailed the seas and discovered America?  Ehyes, Mark?	[]
Cartman	7	0	Ey! How come you never pick me?!	[]
Mr. Garrison	12	1	Because you never know the right answer, butt-for-brains! Yes, Mark?	['butt']
Mark	29	0	The answer is 1492. However, the Americas had already been discovered by many before him, including the Vikings and the Native Americans. And therefore, your question is a charade.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Aww, see? That's what I was gonna say!	[]
Mr. Garrison	19	1	Well, very impressive, Mark. You should be able to throw the grading curve and flunk all these little bastards.	['bastards']
Stan	14	0	Oh, God. This kid's gonna last about five seconds out on the playground.	[]
Mr. Garrison	15	0	Now, who can tell me what country Columbus was from?  Put your hand down, creampuff.	[]
Cartman	23	0	That does it!  I do not need to sit here and be ridiculed! I'm gonna go be home-schooled from now on!	[]
Stan	8	0	You don't wanna be home-schooled, fatass.	[]
Cartman	28	0	I'm gonna be home-schooled, and leave all the pain and suffering of public school behind me! Screw you guys, I'm a-gonna be home-schooled!	[]
Mr. Garrison	7	0	Oh, please God, let it be forever.	[]
Stan	9	0	Come on, Pip, say it. Say Please, hit me.	[]
Pip	9	0	But, if I say that, you'll hit me.	[]
Stan	23	0	No! I'm gonna hit you if you don't say it. If you say Please, hit me, I won't hit you.	[]
Pip	3	0	Please, hit me.	[]
Stan	2	0	All right.	[]
Pip	1	0	Ooowww!	[]
Stan	7	0	Alright, we'll try this again, Pip.	[]
Mark	17	0	I don't understand. You seem to like that boy, yet hate him at the same time.	[]
Craig	8	0	Hey, kid. Get out of that hamster ball.	[]
Mark	8	0	Oh. I promised my father I wouldn't.	[]
Stan	9	0	Oh, boy. Sorry, dude, you're on your own.	[]
Butters	43	0	Oowhy yu- you best do what he says, uh home-school kid. Why, this is our part of the playground, see? And uh, a-and if you don't follow our rules, whyuh, why we're gonna duct-tape ya to the bench.	[]
Mark	16	0	You mean you would actually duct-tape my entire body to a bench? For what purpose?	[]
Craig	14	0	Just get out of the hamster ball, or else you're gonna find out!	[]
Boys	5	0	Okay, let's get him...	[]
Butters	2	0	Got it.	[]
Craig	9	0	Have a nice second half of the day, nerdo!	[]
Butters	15	0	Yeah why, why, you shouldn't be such a smart-mouthed Mr. Know-It-All!	[]
Mark	2	0	Oh, dear.	[]
Mr. Cotswolds	15	0	Oh, where could he be? He should've been home from public school by now.	[]
Mrs. Cotswolds	6	0	I'm sure he's alright.	[]
Mr. Cotswolds	4	0	That must be him.	[]
Mrs. Cotswolds	1	0	Waaaaah!	[]
Mr. Cotswolds	4	0	Oh my God, son!	[]
Mark	4	0	Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.	[]
Mr. Cotswolds	7	0	Mark, what have they done to you?!	[]
Mark	8	0	Well, they duct-taped me to a bench.	[]
Mrs. Cotswolds	2	0	But why?	[]
Mark	13	0	I don't know, mother. It didn't make any sense at all.	[]
Mr. Cotswolds	10	0	Well, you see? This is what happens at public schools!	[]
Mark	8	0	But I want to go back tomorrow, papa.	[]
Mrs. Cotswolds	1	0	What??	[]
Mark	7	0	Please, just give me one more day.	[]
Mrs. Cotswolds	4	0	What do we do?	[]
Mr. Cotswolds	25	0	Well, if we're goin' to let him go back, it looks like I need to have a little talk with those other boys' fathers.	[]
A voice	63	0	Everywhere I go, I'm thinking of you, Rebecca.I don't know what to do, Rebecca.You're so nice, I'd like to get to know you better.So what do you say we get together?You really are quite good-looking, Rebecca!You really are quite good-looking, Rebecca!Rebecca, you're really quite good-looking!You're a fox.	[]
Mr. Cotswolds	49	0	Good evening, gentlemen. If I can have your attention for a few moments.  My son Mark was beat up in school today by your sons. I think it would be appropriate for you to talk with your sons, and instruct them to no longer tease or bother my boy.	[]
Randy	3	0	Uh, look, Mr....	[]
Mr. Cotswolds	1	0	Cotswolds.	[]
Randy	26	0	Mr. Cotswolds, we can't completely control what our kids do socially. That's..., you know, that's for them to figure out on their own.	[]
Mr. Cotswolds	29	0	Well, obviously, they need to be coached a little better.  And furthermore, your son has been harassing my little girl! I would like you to tell him to stop.	[]
Gerald	21	0	Hey, my son is just discovering love. Maybe your daughter is, too. They-uh, they need to know about that stuff.	[]
Mr. Cotswolds	17	0	Uh, hello-o? My girl is eight years old! What does she need to know about love?	[]
Randy	24	0	Well, something. I mean, you can't just wait until she's a teenager and expect her to figure out everything all at once.	[]
Mr. Cotswolds	20	0	I will not tell you how to raise your children, and you will not tell me how to raise mine!	[]
Jimbo	7	0	Eh, you wanna beer or something, Cotswolds?	[]
Mr. Cotswolds	11	0	No, I don't drink beer. I just like wine coolers.	[]
Jimbo	2	0	You what??	[]
Jimbo	7	0	See ya, Cotswolds.  Thanks for stopping by.	[]
Gerald	3	0	Yeah. See ya.	[]
Kyle	16	0	...I can't even get her to understand. It's like she's from another planet.	[]
Mark	6	0	Can I sit here with you?	[]
Stan	6	0	Aw, man, if you have to.	[]
Principal Victoria	31	0	Attention, students. Don't forget that this Friday night is the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance. We will have a very special band performing, so please come early.	[]
Kyle	15	0	Hey! That's it! That dance! I can ask Rebecca to go to the dance!	[]
Stan	11	0	Dude, what happened to you? You're a total wuss now.	[]
Kenny	11	2	(Heheh, yeah. You're a faggot, dude. Fuck, yeah. Hehe-eheh.)	['faggot', 'fuck']
Mark	15	0	Why do you call Kyle names and laugh at him? Is he not your friend?	[]
Stan	14	0	Yeah, dude, but guys just do that. We rip on each other and stuff.	[]
Mark	21	0	I see. It's like, you have to mark your territory as a boy. You have to socially find your place.	[]
Kyle	1	0	What??	[]
Craig	4	0	Enjoying your lunch, nerdo?	[]
Mark	14	0	Ah! Stick and stones may break my bones, but words will never harm me.	[]

Kyle	16	0	Rebecca, don't you ever... look at the town? At that...  flicker of light over there?	[]
Rebecca	5	0	I...  have looked at it.	[]
Kyle	15	0	Well, that's a public school. And in it there are children,  just like us.	[]
Rebecca	12	0	How can children go to school on a f-licker of light?	[]
Kyle	28	0	From public school, your house is just a flicker of light.  Don't you want to go out? All you do is... stay in your house and... study	[]

Kyle	13	0	When a man and a woman feel ...love... they put their lips together.	[]
Rebecca	21	0	Oh, you mean a-a mate. When it is time to increase the herd, my provider will select one for me.	[]
Kyle	21	0	Rebecca, in public school,  we select our... own mate.  In public school, men and women get together. Make each other happy.	[]
Rebecca	26	0	You certainly come from a silly place. Still, I should like to try that... kiss.  So I cold write about it.  How do we do it?	[]
Kyle	5	0	I'm not completely sure.	[]
Rebecca	6	0	Should we...  l-look it up?	[]
Kyle	18	0	No, I think it's something you have to try a few times. Until you get it... right.	[]
Rebecca	5	0	Wow. Wow, that was fun!	[]
Kyle	10	0	Dah.  Does that mean you'll go to the dance?	[]
Rebecca	9	1	Y-you bet your sweet a-ass I will.	['ass']
Craig	37	0	Alright, here's the plan. Tomorrow night at the dance, when none of the chaperones are looking, you guys go grab Mark. Bring him out here, and then we're gonna duct-tape him to this flagpole.	[]
Stan	13	0	Are you sure? He can be out here all night on the flagpole.	[]
Craig	5	1	That's the point, buttpipe.	['buttpipe']
Stan	7	2	Don't call me a buttpipe, buttpipe!	['buttpipe', 'buttpipe']

Men	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Mr. Cotswolds	14	0	Where are my children?! I'm taking them out of this God-forsaken place!	[]
Mark	102	3	Calm down, papa!  Everything is all right.  You see, I've learned something today. Public schools may be a bit lacking in education, but it's the main place where children learn all of their social skills. You can't teach a child social skills. They have to learn them themselves. And the only place to do that is on the playground, in the cafeteria, and so on.  Don't you see, papa? That's what happened to your daughter. You tried so hard to keep her from anything sexual, and now look at her. She's a God-damned whore, papa.	['sexual', 'damned', 'whore']
Butters	4	0	Well, she sure is.	[]
Mark	40	0	I know letting your kids out into the world is scary. I know you wish nothing bad would ever happen to us. But bad things will happen, and we have to start learning now how to deal with those things.	[]
Mr. Cotswolds	20	0	Mark. You're absolutely right.  Okay, children. If it's what you want, you can start going to public school.	[]
Kids	1	0	Alright!	[]
Stan	3	0	Nice speech, nerdo.	[]
Mark	2	1	Thanks, gaywad.	['gaywad']
Cartman	5	0	Now you're gettin' it.	[]
Jimbo	19	0	Well, come on, guys. If I'm not mistaken, we still have someone to duct-tape to the flagpole!	[]
Men	1	0	Hooray!	[]
Mr. Cotswolds	1	0	What?!	[]
Mark	3	0	See ya, papa!	[]
Dio	14	0	Well, I'm glad we all learned something today, kids. Now, let's dance!	[]
