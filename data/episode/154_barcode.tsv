Sharon	12	0	I can't believe you said the N-word on national television.	[]
Randy	33	0	What? Well what was I supposed to do, Sharon? I thought I was gonna make $30,000! Stanley, the only reason Daddy used that word is that he thought he would win money.	[]
Kyle	12	0	Dude, did your dad know that the show was being broadcast live?	[]
Cartman	18	0	Dude, that was the funniest thing I've ever seen. I watched it on YouTube about sixty times.	[]
Stan	13	0	Can we just drop this please? I don't wanna talk about it!	[]
Cartman	24	0	Yeah well, it's not us you have to worry about. It's Token.  He is gonna want to kick your cracker teeth in.	[]
Stan	6	0	No he's not.  Is he?	[]
Kyle	4	0	I don't know.	[]
Stan	22	0	I just need to explain things.  Hey Token. Look, I don't know if you saw Wheel of Fortune last night, but-	[]
Token	20	0	Yeah, I was watching with my whole family. And then we saw all the replays this morning in the news.	[]
Stan	28	0	Listen, Token, my dad isn't a racist. He's just stupid, all right? He just blurted out the N-word, and it's no big deal, okay?	[]
Token	11	0	Uh, well, actually it is kind of a big deal, Stan.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Ohhhhhhhh?	[]
Token	28	0	It may be a mistake, but you don't understand how it feels when that word comes up. So don't say it isn't a big deal.	[]
Cartman	27	2	Oh shit here we go!  It's on! Race war!  Race war! Race war!  Race war is on, everybody! It's going down! Shit is going down!	['shit', 'shit']
Stan	13	0	Token, my dad wasn't trying to be offensive. Just forget about it.	[]
Token	8	0	That's easy for you to say, Stan.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Yeah, come on! Here we go!	[]
Stan	13	0	Yeah, but he didn't say it in anger or anything like that.	[]
Token	9	0	That doesn't mean I can just be fine.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Race war! Come on! Race war!	[]
Token	23	0	If you really think it's not a big deal, then you really are ignorant. That's all. I'm not fighting anybody.	[]
Cartman	14	0	Token forfeits!  Whites win!  Whites win!  Race war is over, everybody! Whites won again!	[]
Randy	30	0	I want to apologize deeply and sincerely for using the N-word on Wheel of Fortune. And I want to assure you that I am not a racist, Reverend Jackson.	[]
Jesse Jackson	10	0	The puzzle you were solving was people who annoy you.	[]
Randy	12	0	Uh well, like anybody else thought it was naggers. I mean, right?	[]
Jesse Jackson	20	0	Mr. Marsh, you need to take time to understand African-American culture, visit black museums, see black performers and artists.	[]
Randy	11	0	Oh! Ah I will! I'm really down with  African-Americans.	[]
Jesse Jackson	9	0	Do you really want to apologize? Are you sure?	[]
Randy	3	0	Y-Yes, absolutely.	[]
Jesse Jackson	10	0	Very well. If you want to apologize, I will accept.	[]
Randy	7	0	Hahh, thank you, Mr. Jackson, thank you.	[]

Token	12	0	Oh I see, so I'm supposed to feel all better now.	[]
Stan	2	0	Well, yeah.	[]
Token	7	0	You just don't get it, Stan!	[]
Stan	7	0	Dude, Jesse Jackson said it's okay!	[]
Token	9	0	Jesse Jackson, is not the emperor, of black people!	[]
Stan	6	0	He told my dad he was...	[]
Woman	53	0	Today we are going to have a guest speaker talk to us about sensitivity and the power of words.  In a moment you will meet Dr. David Nelson, who has first-hand experience in overcoming slander, because David is himself a little person. Who knows what a little person is?  Yes? Over here?	[]
Butters	2	0	A midget?	[]
Woman	42	0	Not exactly. That term is actually considered offensive, and that's why Dr. Nelson goes from school to school getting us all to think about what we say. He has two PhD.'s and has published six books! Please welcome David Nelson!	[]
Mr. Nelson	18	0	Good morning, students! How are we all feeling today?  I would like to share with you all my-	[]
Cartman	6	1	No! Dude! No fucking way!  Dude!	['fucking']
Mr. Nelson	10	0	That, that words are like bullets. And if you give-	[]
Cartman	4	0	Stop! Stop! Stop! Stohahahahahahaha...	[]

Now, how many people are actually from Colorado?  Ya got nothin' better to do on a Friday night than to go to a comedy club, huh?  Hey, don't I know you from somewhere?  Yeah. I know you. You're the guy that said nigger on Wheel of Fortune.  Look! Everybody! It's the nigger guy.	['damned', 'cockroach', 'nigger', 'nigger']
Man 2	4	0	Hey, it is him.	[]
Comedian	18	2	Oh, we got a star in the club. Everyone wave to the nigger guy.  Say, Hi, 'nigger' guy!	['nigger', 'nigger']
Randy	3	1	Hi, nigger guy!	['nigger']
Comedian	12	1	That's all right, nigger guy. You know we're just playin'.	['nigger']
Randy	3	0	Yeah... No problem...	[]
Comedian	35	4	Have you all seen these navigation systems in these cars these days? Damn things look like they're straight out of Far Out Space Nuts. Maybe nigger guy has one. You got one, nigger guy?	['damn', 'nuts', 'nigger', 'nigger']
Man 3	8	1	Hey look, Betty. It's that nigger guy.	['nigger']
Three kids	4	2	Nigger guy. Nigger guy.	['nigger', 'nigger']
Clerk	8	0	Hey. What do you think you're doing?	[]
Randy	5	0	I just... need some aspirin.	[]
Clerk	9	1	You aren't welcome in this store, nigger guy.	['nigger']
Randy	1	0	Fine!	[]
Mr. Nelson	14	0	Principal Victoria, I'm very concerned about the behavior of one of your students.	[]
Principal Victoria	13	0	Yes, we apologize for Eric Cartman's behavior, Mr. Nelson. We feel terrible.	[]
Mr. Nelson	50	0	Why? I don't feel terrible. It doesn't bother me at all.  Words are like bullets, and I let 'em pass right through me.  I just know that with some one-on-one time together with this Eric Cartman, I have a chance to change the way he thinks.	[]
Mr. Mackey	13	0	Uh, it might be best if you just ...let it go, m'kay?	[]
Mr. Nelson	17	0	You don't understand.  You see, words are like bullets. And if you take away the gunpowder-	[]
Mr. Mackey	8	0	Yeah yeah, we we get it, Mr. Nelson.	[]
Principal Victoria	24	0	Very well, Mr. Nelson.  Stacey, go ahead and send in Eric Cartman.  Eric, Mr. Nelson is concerned about how you respond to little people.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Oh. Did I hurt his little feelings?	[]
Mr. Nelson	19	0	You know, you think you have the power to make me insecure, but your words are actually completely powerless.	[]
Cartman	36	0	Oh oh oh oh! If we could get, like, eight of these, we could dress them all up like little beavers, right, and then put 'em in a pond, and see if they build a dam!	[]
Mr. Nelson	11	0	You see? No matter what you say, I'm still standing.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Barely!	[]
Mr. Nelson	10	0	No matter how you act, I can rise above it!	[]
Cartman	11	0	Rise above it! Get it? Like he can rise above anything!	[]
Mr. Nelson	4	1	Shut your fucking mouth!	['fucking']
Principal Victoria	2	0	Mr. Nelson!	[]
Mr. Nelson	17	0	He, he, he didn't get to me. I was I was just I wast just joking	[]
Cartman	14	0	Look, look how his face gets all red! He's like a little strawberry!	[]
Mr. Nelson	1	0	Aaaaaaa!	[]
Randy	108	6	Words with venom, words that bind. Words used like weapons to cloud my mind. I'm a person. I'm a man. But no matter how hard I try, people just say Hey! There goes that 'nigger' guy.  Everywhere I go, it's always the same. I can't get away from that terrible name! Hey Nigger Guy! Nigger Guy! Nigger Guy! Stop! Now go. Call me Nigger Guy! Fill me with your hate! Try to bring me down- Oop up, you're too late. Someone just beat you to it. But my dream will not die: To be thought of as more... than just Nigger Guy.  Respect.	['nigger', 'nigger', 'nigger', 'nigger', 'nigger', 'nigger']
Stan	37	0	Token! Hey, wait up.  I just wanted to say, I get it now. You know, after that little person talk at that assembly the other day, I understand how you feel about somebody saying the N word.	[]
Token	5	0	Sooo black people are midgets.	[]
Stan	2	1	God dammit!	['dammit']
Mr. Nelson	16	0	Excuse me: over here, please? All right, I need all students to join me over here.	[]
Mr. Nelson	48	1	I have called you here because it is time that we taught Eric Cartman a lesson once and for all! In a few seconds, Eric will be sent in, and when we walks through that door, I want you all at the same time to yell, Hello, fatso!	['fatso']
Craig	11	0	...I don't think that's a very good idea, sir.	[]
Mr. Nelson	19	0	He has to learn his lesson! You see, words are like bullets.  All right all right, here he comes.	[]
Kids	2	1	Hello, fatso!	['fatso']
Cartman	30	3	Hey! What the hell is that?! You think that's fuckin' funny?!  Kyle, did you put everybody up to this?!  I bet you did! What the hell is going on?!	['hell', 'fuckin', 'hell']
Mr. Nelson	18	0	Now you know how it feels.  You didn't like it when the tables were turned, did ya?	[]
Cartman	20	0	Alright, alright, alright, who is the freaking genius who dressed him up in little suspenders? Clyde, was that you? Gahahahahaha!	[]
Mr. Nelson	10	0	You can't get to me! Words are like bullets!	[]
Randy	121	3	And so it is my honor to announce today the Randy Marsh African-American Scholarship Foundation.  It is my hope that this foundation will prove my commitment to the education of African-American students and erase once and for all my identity as the nigger guy.  You really... you really don't know how hard it is to be constantly reminded of something lame that happened in your past. I mean I... just wanna move on from what happened on Wheel of Fortune, you know and... and when people call me... nigger guy... they're bringing up a painful chapter of my history and all the negativity that went along with it. You just... you can't imagine how that feels.	['nigger', 'lame', 'nigger']
Black Man	5	1	Is this nigger guy serious?	['nigger']
Randy	12	0	Anyway, here's to a new start for us all. Thank you!	[]
Driver	10	0	Thar look Skeeter! That's that guy from the TV!	[]
Skeeter	11	1	Well well well, looks like we got ourselves a nigger guy!	['nigger']
Randy	2	0	Awww! Awwww!	[]
Skeeter	8	0	Yee haw! Yiiip yip yip yip yip yip.	[]
Passenger	1	0	Wooo!	[]
Randy	1	0	Whoa!	[]
Skeeter	5	1	Where you goin' nigger guy?	['nigger']
Randy	8	0	Please I, I don't want any trouble.	[]
Skeeter	19	0	Well you got trouble, when you first decided to slander an entire race of people on Wheel of Fortune!	[]
Driver	18	1	Yeah. You like making fun of minorities, nigger guy? Huh we don't take kindly to social ignorance.	['nigger']
Passenger	7	0	You tell 'im, Skeeter, you tell 'im!	[]
Randy	4	0	What do you want?	[]
Skeeter	21	0	What do we want?  We want to live in a world without people like you who are intolerant of African-Americans!	[]
Man 4	3	0	Leave him alone.	[]
Passenger	7	1	Hey... That's that other nigger guy.	['nigger']
Skeeter	1	0	Huh?	[]
Passenger	15	0	That's the guy from Seinfeld, used the N-word a whole bunch o' times.	[]
Driver	8	1	Michael Richards? Huh well, son of a bitch!	['bitch']
Skeeter	14	1	Looks like it's our lucky day! We done got us two nigger guys!	['nigger']
Man 5	3	0	Make that three.	[]
Passenger	2	0	Mark Fuhrman?	[]
Skeeter	1	0	Who?	[]
Passenger	11	0	He done said the N-word in the O.J. case.	[]
Driver	8	1	Well what is this? A nigger guy convention?	['nigger']
Richards	8	0	We aren't being pushed around anymore. Leave.	[]
Driver	11	1	Come on, Skeeter.  These nigger guys ain't worth our trouble.	['nigger']
Skeeter	7	2	Damn nigger guys!  We'll be back!	['damn', 'nigger']
Richards	6	0	You'd better come with us.	[]
Richards	11	0	Come on in, Mr. Marsh. We'll make you some coffee.	[]
Randy	5	0	What's going on here?	[]
Fuhrman	51	0	We've been following your story since we first saw it on the news. Don't worry - you're with friends now. Dale here used the N-word in a racial joke at work. Scott used the plural N-word to refer to a group of gardeners who broke his fence.	[]
Scott	7	0	They were Mexicans. I was being ironic.	[]
Richards	6	0	We're all just like you.	[]
Randy	23	0	No.  No no, I'm sorry, but I'm not... like you. I just said the N-word by mistake to win money.	[]
Richards	39	0	I made a mistake too.  I was trying to be funny! I got frustrated and thought I would get some shock laughs. I'm just... not that good of a comedian if you want to know the real truth.	[]
Randy	19	0	You said the N-word to a black man's face! That's way worse than what I did!	[]
Richards	58	2	You really think that matters?!  You really think all those people out there see a difference? Oh, they might say your racial slur was more accidental; they might even laugh about it. But at the end of the day, all you are to them is just another damned nigger guy!  Oh, you don't like that, do ya?	['damned', 'nigger']
Randy	1	0	No.	[]
Fuhrman	21	0	Randy, we want you to join us. We have a plan to make this all go away once and for all.	[]
Stan	21	0	Now look, Token, I've done everything I can to make this right! You have no reason to still be mad!	[]
Token	13	0	I have every reason to be mad! You just don't get it!	[]
Stan	9	0	I'm not responsible for what my dad did!	[]
Token	11	0	No, but you can't just pretend it never happened either!	[]
Stan	8	1	What the hell do you want from me?!	['hell']
Token	1	0	Nothing!	[]
Stan	4	0	Then stop being mad!	[]
Token	1	0	No!	[]
Butters	10	0	Fellas! Fellas come quick! Cartman's gonna fight the midget!	[]
Butters	6	0	All right, Eric, come on, Eric.	[]
Kyle	17	0	Dude, are you sure you wanna do this? Apparently this guy has a black belt in karate.	[]
Cartman	5	0	It's a midget, dude.	[]
Mr. Nelson	16	1	Students, I am going to beat the crap out of this kid to prove a point.	['crap']
Cartman	16	0	Hahaha, no dude. It can't talk, that isn't fair, I'll laugh too much.	[]
Randy	42	1	Senators, I know it is not normally considered American to ban words.  But there is one slur that has caused so much damage that we believe it should finally be made illegal. I'm talking, of course, about the term nigger guy.	['nigger']
Senator 1	2	1	Nigger guy?	['nigger']
Randy	17	0	Two words which by themselves can be harmless but which together... form a verbal missile of hate.	[]
Richards	4	0	Yeah! That's right!	[]
Randy	41	1	Oh sure. Some people just use the term in jest - tell a nigger guy joke or two thinking it's no big deal - but they don't realize it can lead to people using the term as an excuse for violence.	['nigger']
Skeeter	11	2	Goddamn nigger guy's tryin' to be all political-like now!	['goddamn', 'nigger']
Randy	37	1	Senators, I've learned to admit that I'm capable of having- slightly racist thoughts once in a while. Can anybody say they never do? How long will it be before you are all called nigger guys?	['nigger']
Senator 2	21	1	Uhhh, hold on a second, are you suggesting that nigger guy could become a slur that refers to all white people?	['nigger']
Senator 3	14	1	I'm certainly not a nigger guy. I've never thought a racist thought.	['nigger']
Senator 4	11	1	Aw, come on, you're the biggest nigger guy in Washington.	['nigger']
Senator 1	20	1	Mr. Marsh, we see now the importance of your bill.  All those in favor to ban the term nigger guy?	['nigger']
Most Senators	1	0	Aye!	[]
Senator 1	1	0	Opposed?	[]
Senator 4	1	0	Nay?	[]
Senator 1	4	0	The motion is passed!	[]
Randy	3	0	We did it!	[]
Field Reporter	15	0	For the first time in American history, a word has been officially banned from use.	[]
Senator 3	22	1	From now on, if a person uses the word nigger, it must be at least seven words away from the word guy.	['nigger']
Field Reporter	18	2	Tom, it appears that the nigger guy epidemic is ove-  Oh dammit I said it, didn't I?	['nigger', 'dammit']
Mr. Nelson	7	0	AAAA! Ow! Ow! Okay!  Okay, you win!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Say Uncle!	[]
Mr. Nelson	2	0	Ung-cle!	[]
Cartman	10	0	Hahaha, now say Caroline, don't go into the light!	[]
Mr. Nelson	7	0	Caroline, don't go into the light!	[]
Cartman	8	0	Haaha, hahahahahaha! Oh man, that is hysterical!  Oh!	[]
Mr. Nelson	23	0	There! Now you all see that I am not limited by my size.  I have proven my point! My work here is done!	[]
Stan	4	0	What was his point?	[]
Kyle	4	0	I have no idea.	[]
Stan	6	0	Dude, I don't get it.	[]
Kyle	6	0	I don't get it either.	[]
Stan	11	0	Wait a minute. That's it! I don't get it.	[]
Kyle	1	0	...Huh?	[]
Stan	61	0	Don't you see, Kyle? I don't get it!  Token, I get it now. I don't get it. I've been trying to say that I understand how you feel, but, I'll never understand. I'll never really get how it feels for a black person to have somebody use the N word. I don't get it.	[]
Token	5	0	Now you get it, Stan.	[]
Stan	7	0	Yeah. I totally don't get it.	[]
Token	2	0	Thanks, dude.	[]
