Kyle	8	0	That's only a vaccination for girls, stupid!	[]
Cartman	16	1	Then why are they sayin' that gettin' vaccinated at school is gonna make us all retarded?	['retarded']

Mr. Mackey	100	1	M'kay, Stan, you, you've gotta try and pull yourself out of this, m'kay? I know that... your parents recently got divorced. M'kay, that's gotta be hard. I know that's... that's bad. But when you walk around all mopey, m'kay, and sayin' everything is... just shitty, well, that's called bein' a Debbie Downer, Stan. And nobody likes a Debbie Downer, m'kay. ...I mean you've gotta, you've gotta snap out of it, Debbie. Come on, Debbie, you're even bummin' me out now, m'kay? Your attitude just- just sucks.

Announcer	12	1	This is breaking news, from CNN! Or Fox or, whatever.  Fuck you.	['fuck']
Anchor	39	0	The first documented case of a child developing Asperger's Syndrome from school vaccinations  has put the government in a tight spot.  At a press conference today the media heard from the young boy's father, Steamy Ray Vaughn.	[]
Randy	55	2	It's pretty shitty when you work so hard to be a great parent, and then the government comes along and with one shot turns your child into a mentally incapacitated freak! I mean look at him. He's disinterested, depressed, self-loathing. It's most likely the reason his mother and I got divorced!	['shitty', 'freak']
Anchor	23	0	In response to the embarrassment, the President of the United States has passed Stan's Bill, putting an end to school-mandated vaccinations.	[]
Aide 1	6	0	Mr. President, the bill is ready.	[]

Aide 1	12	0	Aaand if you could just sign this one as well, Mr. President.	[]
Anchor	24	0	It is yet unknown if any other children have contracted from the vaccinations, but if so, multimillion-dollar lawsuits are probably not far behind.	[]

Nurse Bronski	7	1	Why are there hamburgers in your underwear?	['hamburgers']
Cartman	16	1	Are you serious? How can there be-  Oh my God! You're saying I have assburgers??	['assburgers']
Nurse Bronski	16	0	This doesn't make sense. Are you trying to sneak food into the school or something?	[]
Cartman	17	1	What are you talking about?? I got vaccinated from the school, and now clearly I have Assburgers!	['assburgers']
Nurse Bronski	2	0	Very funny!	[]

Nurse Bronski	5	0	Get out of my office!	[]
Wendy	10	0	Hey Kyle?  Have you heard anything at all from Stan?	[]
Kyle	25	0	I've tried, Wendy. I've called him, I've been to his house. But since his diagnosis, all he's done is gotten worse.	[]
Wendy	15	0	I don't know what to do. It's like he's... completely turned off.	[]
Boy 1	10	0	Those two should just screw and get it over with!	[]
Boy 2	1	0	Yeaahh...	[]
Kyle	33	1	I can't keep doing it, Wendy. I know he has an illness, but goddamn, it uh, it's like being around a black hole that just sucks the life out of everything.	['goddamn']
Wendy	20	0	Look, maybe what we should do is all go over to his house together, an-and that way we could-	[]
Kyle	34	0	NO. I can't, Wendy.  All his negativity is starting to make me depressed. I have to let him go.  And whatever happens next, I'm going to embrace with a totally  positive attitude.	[]
Cartman	6	2	Godamned stupid school nurse! Heartless bitch!	['godamned', 'bitch']
Kyle	5	0	What's the matter dude?	[]
Cartman	14	1	I spent all morning making hamburgers for nothing! That's what's the matter!	['hamburgers']
Kyle	19	1	You made hamburgers? Well that's awesome! I'd love one.  Mmm. Hm, wow  This is really good, Cartman.	['hamburgers']

Riley	4	0	Wow. What is that?	[]
Kyle	8	0	Seriously, Cartman. You could make money with these!	[]
Cartman	3	0	Gee, thanks Kyle!	[]
Researcher	31	0	The truth is we still know very little about Asperger's syndrome, Mrs. Marsh. All our patients here show the same social awkwardness that your son exhibits.  Good morning Mr. Mathers.	[]
Mr. Mathers	2	0	Goodbye, doctor	[]
Researcher	33	0	It's as if they all have an inability to distinguish from what is socially acceptable and what is not.  We've got a new patient, Martin. I want you to meet Stan.	[]
Martin	4	0	Nice to meet you.	[]
Researcher	58	0	Here at the treatment center, our focus is on awareness.  Asperger's is serious, but unfortunately because of its name people think it's a disease to be made fun of.  Alright everyone, let's have a seat.  Oh uh, we'll be done at about 5 pm, Mrs. Marsh. I'll call if it's any earlier.	[]
Sharon	10	0	Oh, right, uh. Good bye, Stan. I-I love you.	[]
Researcher	4	0	Alright, are we clear?	[]
Neo	3	0	We're clear!	[]
Morpheus	45	0	Watch that window, Puck!  Everyone, make sure this room isn't bugged!  Alright Stan, listen up! We don't have a lot of time! You've been told Asperger's is real! It isn't! It's just a front we use to stay hidden!	[]
Stan	7	0	Wait, it's not a real illness?	[]
Morpheus	47	0	Of course not! If there was a social development disease, you wouldn't call it Asperger's! That's just, that's just mean!  There's a big war going on out there, Stan, and we want you to join our fight to bring it all down!	[]
Stan	8	0	Uh, nooo nonono, we're not doing this!	[]
Morpheus	46	2	You've broken through their reality and they don't like it! Others deserve to know the truth! You see everything as shit, don't you?!  Where other people see fun movies and hear cool music, all you see and hear is shit! Am I right?	['shit', 'shit']
Stan	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Neo	12	0	So do we. All of us here. We know the truth too.	[]
Morpheus	15	0	We found a way to make it stop, Stan. Now are you interested? Or not?	[]
Cartman	11	0	Next order, please! Get your Cartman Burgers here, fresh and flavorful.	[]
Clyde	9	0	I just can't believe how yummy these are.	[]
Cartman	9	0	There you go, Molly, and a bag of chips.	[]
Molly	1	0	Thanks!	[]
Cartman	8	1	How are we doing on those patties, Jew?	['jew']
Kyle	4	0	About three minutes, fatass!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Nice!	[]
Butters	12	0	Jeez, we're out of finished burgers again, Eric. We need more.	[]
Cartman	17	0	It's alright. I think another batch is just finishing off in our top-secret flavor enhancer.	[]
Kyle	22	0	Dude, come on Cartman. As employees, don't you think we should get to see what the final secret flavor enhancer is?	[]
Cartman	40	1	I'm sorry Kyle, but if we compromise our final cooking process, then our patented flavor will be everywhere, and we'll have to go back to school. Now, let me get those hamburgers.  Alright, these are good to go!	['hamburgers']
Morpheus	8	0	Alright, is he ready to be sent in?	[]
Bald Guy	7	0	He's ready! Beta levels are normal.	[]
Stan	4	0	Who are you people?	[]
Morpheus	32	1	We are the Secret Society of Cynics.  Everything looks like shit to you, right? What if I were to tell you... that you're seeing the world the way it actually is?	['shit']
Stan	1	0	Huh?	[]
Morpheus	25	1	The world around us has all completely turned to shit. But aliens are putting out a brainwave that keeps most people seeing a false reality	['shit']
Stan	1	0	Aliens?	[]
Morpheus	20	0	Or, robots from the future, whatever. The point is they need to keep everyone in a blissful state of ignorance.	[]
Neo 2	20	1	Yeah. Everything used to be awesome and cool, but now everything's gone to shit and nobody knows except us!	['shit']
Neo	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Stan	3	0	Because of aliens?	[]
Morpheus	48	1	Or genetically altered humans, whatever, fuck you! All that matters is that you are the key to bringing this whole thing down. They know who we are, but they won't be expecting you! Are you ready to go back into the illusionary world you once lived in?	['fuck']
Stan	4	0	Yeah I'm ready!	[]
Morpheus	7	0	Let's send him in!  Drink this.	[]
Stan	3	0	Ahhhh!  Oh coool!	[]
Adam Sandler	8	0	Jill, you got a date with Al Pacino?	[]
Jill	11	0	I think Al Pacino wants to play Twister with your sister.	[]
Stan	4	0	Adam Sandler's funny.	[]
Butters	6	0	Hey Kyle, you have a visitor.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Stan?	[]
Stan	1	0	Kyle!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Hey, Stan!	[]
Stan	22	2	Dude, I'm sorry. I've been a shitty friend. I miss my buddy. You were right: Adam Sandler is fuckin' hysterical!	['shitty', 'fuckin']
Kyle	4	0	Stan, are you alright?	[]
Stan	19	2	Yeah dude, I totally get it now. I can see how lame I was saying everything was, was shit.	['lame', 'shit']
Kyle	6	0	Really? Uh, Stan, that's great.	[]
Stan	29	3	But Kyle, it's all shit! For real! It's all shit 'cause the aliens with AI and you and me are gonna fuck it all up! Come on!	['shit', 'shit', 'fuck']
Kyle	5	0	Dude. Have you been drinking?	[]
Stan	24	0	You're not listening to me, Kyle. Dude, we have to go do this one thing, and then everything can go back to normal!	[]
Kyle	21	0	It's too late for that. Things just can't go back, Stan, uh.  Ah-I'm with Cartman Burger now.	[]
Stan	10	2	...Dude, Cartman Burger? Seriously? How shitty- is that fuckin' concept?	['shitty', 'fuckin']
Kyle	14	0	See? There you go again. Look at you dude. Look what you've become.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Everything alright here, Kyle?	[]
Kyle	4	0	Yeah, it's fine.	[]
Cartman	10	0	We're uh gonna need some more patties pretty soon.	[]
Kyle	8	0	Yeah yeah, ahh I'll be right there.	[]
Stan	10	0	Come on, Kyle. This is about you and me, remember?!	[]
Kyle	20	0	Look, dude, things around here have changed. Sometimes, the only way to keep going is to make a left turn.	[]
Stan	25	4	Fuck you Kyle, you're a piece of shit!  ...Kyle, I love you.  You're a piece of shit though. Fuck you!  ...I love you.	['fuck', 'shit', 'shit', 'fuck']
Big Harry	24	0	Big Harry and Mike in the Morning and in case you didn't catch last night's episode of , we're breakin' it down.	[]
Mike	8	0	Oh Big Harry, when the  ran into the -	[]
Big Harry	5	0	Nonono, no! How about when .	[]
Morpheus	10	0	He's back!  Did you see the illusionary world again?	[]
Neo	10	0	How does it feel to be back in the Matrix?	[]
Stan	5	1	I feel like total shit.	['shit']
Bald Guy	15	0	It's okay. That's just your brain levels adjusting back to the real world.	[]
Morpheus	16	0	Try and focus, Stan: we've found them! We know where the rock creatures are now.	[]
Stan	3	0	The rock creatures?	[]
Morpheus	8	1	Or aliens, or AI- things. Whatever, fuck you.	['fuck']
Stan	9	0	Dude, I canh- I... I can't do any...	[]
Neo	4	0	He's gonna pop!	[]
Morpheus	11	0	Come on kid, there's not a lot of time left.	[]
Neo	6	0	You're pushin' him too hard!	[]
Stan	2	0	Ugh God.	[]
Morpheus	20	0	Stan, you have to convince people they're living in a world of illusion. We're sending you back in!	[]
Figure 1	29	0	We all know why we are here. There's a rebellion in our midst and it must be SQUASHED OUT!  We have to put an end, to Cartman Burgers.	[]
Other Execs	7	0	Yes, yes, but what do we do?	[]
KFC Exec	10	0	At KFC we've seen a 50% drop in sales.	[]
Pizza Hut Exec	12	0	It's worse at Pizza Hut. Cartman Burgers choked out the market.	[]
McDonald's Exec	20	0	What makes them so good? For whatever reason, these Cartman Burgers satisfy the taste cravings from all of our restaurants!	[]
Taco Bell Exec	24	0	There lies the secret.  It's the chemical compounds from all our flavors. Pizza Hut, Burger King, KFC, all somehow infused into one burger.	[]
KFC Exec	42	0	It's as if he's somehow taking all the ingredients of our food, breaking them down into some kind of... gas. And them somehow... infusing that gas into his hamburger. What kind of instrument could he be using to do this?	[]
Pizza Hut Exec	11	0	It would have to be some sort of super Dutch oven.	[]
Burger King Exec	12	0	But a Dutch oven with greater technology than we've ever seen.	[]
Stan	1	0	Aughah.	[]
McDonald's Exec	12	0	Hey! Wake up. Come on now, wake up!  Use the smelling salts!	[]

Taco Bell Exec	16	0	He's lying!  You see this kid in the picture? This guy is his best friend.	[]
McDonald's Exec	2	0	Ah ha!	[]
Stan	6	0	I'm not friends with him.	[]
Taco Bell Exec	7	0	They've been through everything together. Inseparable.	[]
Stan	8	0	No, no, we don't hang out anymore.	[]
McDonald's Exec	13	0	Oho right, like someone would just walk away from a friendship like that?	[]
Stan	21	1	Dude, I didn't walk away! I turned 10 and everything he wanted to do seemed shitty to me, so I-!	['shitty']
McDonald's Exec	29	0	Oh sure! Anyone would ditch out on their best friend 'cause they weren't feeling good! Now stop playing games and tell us why Cartman Burgers is so delicious!	[]
Stan	4	0	I don't know!	[]
McDonald's Exec	14	0	Alright, I guess we're going to have to do this the hard way.	[]
Kyle	7	0	There, ten mediums and five medium-rares.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Alright, I'll take these to the flavor enhancer.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Next please.  Oh, hey.	[]
Stan	11	0	Kyle, you've gotta tell me the secret to Cartman Burger.	[]
Kyle	4	0	What are you doing?	[]
Stan	8	0	How do you guys make them so yummy?	[]
Kyle	4	0	I don't know.	[]
McDonald's Exec	22	0	You'd BETTER get him to tell you or you're getting shot in the back of the head!  You got that?!	[]
Stan	9	0	Dude, just tell me the secret to Cartman Burger	[]
Kyle	16	0	Why?! So that we can lose our business and everything can go back to old times?!	[]
Stan	11	0	No, because there's aliens with a sniper-chicken on me.	[]
Kyle	24	0	Oh God! Look, I know you got Asperger's from the school and I I'm sorry. But your negativity is poison to me!	[]
McDonald's Exec	17	0	Oh, right. Like a friend would walk out on somebody who was diagnosed with a serious illness!	[]
Stan	17	0	Dude, I'm sorry that I've been bumming you out, but it's not my fault!	[]
Kyle	8	1	You said fuck you to my face, Stan.	['fuck']
Stan	9	0	Dude, I didn't realize what I was saying.	[]
McDonald's Exec	17	0	Oh yeah, like any friend would say something that severe and then try to take it back.	[]
Kyle	23	0	Alright, look. I honestly don't know the secret, dude. Only Cartman does, and that's how it's gonna work for us.	[]
McDonald's Exec	29	1	Goddamnit this is getting us nowhere!  Everyone get back! Do you wanna play hardball?! That's fine!  All right, let's see this mighty machine once and for all!	['goddamnit']
Morpheus	5	1	You vampire sons of bitches!	['bitches']
Neo	1	0	Haha!	[]
Morpheus	16	0	Alright, nice work Stan. Now comes the final step! You have to take out Duck President!	[]
Stan	10	1	Just stop it! You people are so full of shit!	['shit']
Mr. Mathers	16	0	Uh oh, looks like the serum is wearing off!  Here, you'd better take some more!	[]
Stan	6	0	No, I'm done with that!	[]
Morpheus	27	0	But Stan, you have to take down the bad guys and go through a personal transformation, so that everything can go back to the way it was!	[]
Stan	147	0	I don't want everything to go back to the way it was!  I, I don't.  You were right, Kyle. Sometimes, the only way to go forward, is to take a big left turn. I've been resisting it, but I'm ready now. I want you to stay with Cartman Burger, dude. It's okay. You're gonna do this and I'm gonna do my thing and ...my mom and dad aren't getting back together. But you know what? It's okay. In fact, it's better. Change is gonna bring new things to all of us. Where will Cartman Burger go from here? That'll be cool to see. And it opens me up to a whole new adventure, exploring... new relationships with all new people in town.  Maybe this kid will become my new best friend.  Or maybe this kid will.	[]
Douglas	1	0	Wow.	[]
Stan	41	0	Maybe it won't be like before, but... at least it'll all be new. And that's what's gonna make it so that I can keep going. For the first time in a long time, I'm really excited.	[]
Randy	16	0	Stan? Stan! Get in the car, Stan! Your mom and I are movin' back in together!	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Randy	6	0	We worked it out, pal. Surprise!	[]
Stan	5	0	No, dad, no. No, please!	[]
Sharon	20	0	We talked a lot and, we know it's what's best for you kids and, I don't know...	[]
Stan	9	0	No, Mom, sometimes you've got- a left turn.	[]
Sharon	23	0	People get older, Stanley. And as you get older you realize... the best thing to do is just... stick with what you know.	[]
Kyle	8	1	You were sticking these in your ass, Cartman?!	['ass']
Crowd	1	0	Eeewww!	[]
