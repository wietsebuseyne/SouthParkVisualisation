Stan	2	0	...Go away.	[]
Kyle	14	0	Stan, you can't keep doing this to yourself. You have to go live.	[]
Stan	16	0	Why? What's the point of living when the only girl I ever loved is gone?	[]
Cartman	4	1	God, what a fag!	['fag']
Kyle	3	0	Dude, not now!	[]
Stan	49	0	You guys have no idea how this feels. It's like, you always hear songs about a broken heart and you think it's just a figure of speech? But it's true. My chest hurts. I feel this like, sinking feeling where my heart is. It's broken...	[]

Butters	16	0	She wants to see me again! My Raisins girl said she wants to see me again!	[]

Lexus	30	0	Gosh, that's the nicest gift I've gotten all night. Thank you.  Well I gotta go, honey. Be sure to come back to Raisins and see me again, okaaay?	[]
Butters	22	0	Well yeah, but, but, hey,  hey Lexus? Well I was thinking, well, I was thinking that we should- go do something sometime.	[]
Lexus	35	0	Oh gee, that would be great, honey, but I'm reeeally busy this week. Tell you what: you come back to Raisins and then we'll be able to hang out all we want, okay?	[]
Butters	2	0	O-kay!	[]
Lexus	2	0	Bye, cutie!	[]
Butters	8	0	Bye, bye darling!  Wow... a real-life relationship.	[]
Mr. Garrison	12	0	All right, kids! Out on the gym floor for P.E. class.	[]
Kyle	8	0	Come on, Stan. We're gonna play dodgeball.	[]
Stan	12	0	I can't believe it. She's in love with somebody else.	[]
Kyle	25	0	Dude, you need to snap out of this! So Wendy left you for Token. What are you gonna do? Just be miserable your whole life?	[]
Stan	12	0	There's nothing else I can do. She was my whole life.	[]
Kyle	37	0	Aw, come on, dude! All you've done for the last four days is mope around! You might as well hang out with those Goth kids who dress in black and talk about pain all the time!	[]
Stan	17	0	Maybe I should. At least they will understand me. Maybe I should hang with the Goth kids.	[]
Pete	30	0	Life is pain. Life is only pain.  We're all taught to believe in happy fairytale endings.  But there's only blackness. Dark, depressing loneliness that  eats at your soul.	[]
Michael	62	1	Who needs that kind of Barbie love, anyway? Everyone's just walking around like a bunch of conformists. Go ahead and wear your business suits so you can make thirty-four thousand dollars a year to buy your condominium. They're all zombies racing to their graves. Love didn't work for my mom and dad. Why should it work for me?	['condominium']
Henrietta	66	3	My dad is such an asshole. Drunken bastard doesn't even know I exist. But then he won't let me go to the Skinny Puppy concert because my heroine-addict aunt is coming over for dinner.  Dinner? That's a laugh. Just an excuse for my mom to bitch at me for not wearing girly clothes like all the Britney Spears wannabes at this school.	['asshole', 'bastard', 'bitch']
Firkle	9	0	They're all a bunch of Nazi conformists cheerleaders.	[]
Stan	13	0	But if life is only pain, then... what's the point of living?	[]
Pete	9	0	Just to make life more miserable for the conformists.	[]
Stan	8	0	All right, so how do I join you?	[]
Michael	27	0	If you wanna be one of the non-conformists, all you have to do is dress just like us and listen to the same music we do.	[]
Stan	1	0	...'K.	[]
Mercedes	18	0	Okay, I know it's your first day, Ferrari, so I wanna go over the basics with you.	[]
Ferrari	1	0	Okay.	[]
Mercedes	167	0	First of all, there's a five foot rule. If you come within five feet of a customer, you need to acknowledge them, even if they're not at your table. Hey,  cutie.  When you're not serving food or talking with customers, you need to dance around and have fun.  We use things like Hula Hoops, silly strings, and water guns to play with the other girls. Be sure to giggle a lot, and be sure to show off your raisins.  Now, when you take a customer's order, you need to sit down at the table with them and make them think you're interested. Write your name down for them and make them feel special. Oh man, I am so bored. Thank God you guys came in. If you want good tips, the most important thing is physical contact. Just a simple hold of the arm can mean the difference between five and twenty dollars. I'll be right back with your order, guys.	[]
Ferrari	6	0	Wow, thank you so much, Mercedes.	[]
Mercedes	20	0	Okay. Well, I guess we're ready to open for business. Good luck.  Go ahead and open for business, Porsche!	[]
Porsche	1	0	Okay!	[]
Raisins Girl	4	0	Hi, welcome to Raisins!	[]

Lexus	2	0	Hey, cutie.	[]
Butters	1	0	Darling!	[]
Lexus	5	0	How are we doing today?	[]
Butters	7	0	Oh God. I missed you so much.	[]
Henrietta	29	0	Shallow life. Drowning alone, I gasp for air. Coldness creeps over pale skin. There is sadness so deep it pulls me down Happiness dies in a deep, dark sea.	[]
Pete	3	0	Yeah, happiness dies.	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Michael	12	0	All right, your turn, Stan. Read one of your poems about pain.	[]
Stan	17	1	There is darkness all around me Deep, piercing black, I cannot breathe My heart has been raped.	['raped']
Henrietta	1	0	Whoa.	[]
Stan	21	0	The pain is everlasting. I miss you so much, babe. Want to hold you in my arms again, girl. Want to-	[]
Pete	10	0	Whoa, whoa! Dude! Those last two lines aren't Goth!	[]
Stan	3	0	They're not?	[]
Michael	20	0	No, dude! You can't say I miss you so much, babe. I want to hold you in my arms.	[]
Henrietta	17	0	Make it I miss seeing you so much I wanna slash my eyes out with razor blades.	[]
Henrietta's Mom	3	0	Henrietta! Hi sweetie!	[]
Henrietta	6	0	Go away Mom! Leave me alone!	[]
Henrietta's Mom	18	0	Daddy and I just got your birthday present! But you can't see what it is till tomorrow!	[]
Henrietta	21	0	You'd like to wait till I was dead, wouldn't you? You'd like to see maggots eat my face.	[]
Henrietta's Mom	6	0	Ee-you are so creative, honey.	[]
Henrietta	2	1	Conformist bitch.	['bitch']
Other Goths	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Porsche	14	0	Thanks for calling Raisins. This is Porsche. Have you tried our Double Whammy Wings?	[]
Butters	9	0	Hi. Is Lexus there, please? This is her boyfriend.	[]

Butters	2	0	Hey Lexus.	[]

Butters	5	0	Wuh it's me, Butters.	[]
Lexus	11	0	Oh, okay. Hi, cutie.  Hey sweetie.  So how are you, honey?	[]
Butters	49	1	I'm fine. I miss you though.  Yeah, school was pretty tough today. We had two quizzes, and one of them was a pop quiz.  Sometimes I think our classes are too hard.  But I thought about you all day long. I promise. So how is your day going?	['classes']
Lexus	2	0	Good, good.	[]
Butters	19	0	Hey, hey sweetie, I was thinking tonight you could come over and we could watch The Exorcist on DVD.	[]
Lexus	16	0	Oh, gee, I don't know, cutie.  Why don't you just come down to Raisins?	[]
Butters	22	0	Oh well, uh I kinda don't have any money left. Unh, I spent it all on Raisins the last six times.	[]
Lexus	11	0	Awww, that's too bad, cutie. I really wanna see you.	[]
Butters	19	0	Oh, I really wanna see you too, baby. Eh don't, don't worry. I'll get more money	[]
Lexus	4	0	'K sugar. Gotta run.	[]
Butters	43	0	Uh-okay. Uh, hey, Lexus, well, there's something I've been meaning to say.  Here it goes: Lexus, I- Oh jeeze, maybe I shouldn't say it- no wait, I want to say it. I love you.  Heeheee, heh, Oh my God.	[]
Butters	9	0	Dad, I need an advance on my allowance again.	[]
Stephen	11	0	O-hoo no Butters! You got an advance two days ago.	[]
Butters	6	0	Uh but I spent it all.	[]
Linda	9	0	What are you spending all that money on, Butters?	[]
Butters	3	0	On my girlfriend.	[]
Stephen	1	0	Girlfriend?	[]
Linda	5	0	You... have a girlfriend, Butters?	[]
Butters	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Chris	6	0	And she's... a... girl, right?	[]
Butters	1	0	Yup!	[]
Chris	7	0	Well all right! Good for you, Butters!	[]
Linda	12	0	Oh, that is so cute. When do we get to meet her?	[]
Butters	32	0	Well, I was hopin' to go see her right now. You can come alone.  But don't embarrass me or nothin'.  I'm sure she'll be real nervous to impress you.	[]
Stephen	17	0	Don't worry, Butters. We just wanna say hi and then we'll leave you two alone.	[]
Butters	1	0	Okay.	[]
Stephen	11	1	You see? I told you he wouldn't turn out gay.	['gay']
Linda	4	0	All right, you win.	[]
Michael	8	0	Hey, can we get more coffee over here?	[]
Waitress	26	1	Damn it, are you kids just gonna sit here all night again and drink six dollars' work of coffee?! Why don't you get a life?!	['damn']
Michael	15	0	Conformist. Have fun in your rat-race life, living paycheck to paycheck for corporate gains.	[]
Other Goths	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Pete	7	0	Dude, you haven't drank your coffee.	[]
Stan	6	0	Well I don't drink coffee.	[]
Pete	13	0	You can't be a non-conformist if you don't drink coffee.	[]
Kyle	17	1	Oh Jesus Christ, I had to see it to believe it! What the hell are you doing?!	['hell']
Stan	8	0	Breathing deep in darkness that envelops my soul.	[]
Kyle	12	1	God-damnit dude, your mom and dad want you to come home!	['damnit']
Stan	21	0	So they can fill my head with more Disney lies about how perfect the world is? I don't think so.	[]
Pete	27	1	Yeah. Why don't you just go back to your Justin Timberlake and your homework, you conformist asshole?  You just don't know what real pain is.	['asshole']
Kyle	18	1	Oh, like you know what pain is! Go try living in a Third-World country, you little pussy!	['pussy']
Pete	14	0	I'm not gonna live in a Third-World country with all the conformists.	[]
Kyle	23	0	Stan, this is it. Time to stop feeling sorry for yourself and come home! Everyone cares about you and everyone wants you back!	[]
Stan	9	0	What about Wendy? Isn't she still with Token?	[]
Kyle	3	0	Yeah. She is.	[]
Stan	27	0	Then people shouldn't care about me-ehhh. Because I don't care about them. What's the point of caring if all it brings is pain?	[]
Henrietta	2	0	For sure.	[]
Kyle	11	0	Fine. That's it. I give up. Have fun being miserable.	[]
Stan	1	0	...conformist.	[]
Other Goths	1	0	Yeah.	[]

Mercedes	11	0	Great.  Be sure to try our Cheddar Poppers. Right this way.	[]
Raisins Girl	11	0	Who else wants a signed Raisins Girls calendar for five dollars?	[]
Diners	4	0	Woohoo, all right, yeah!	[]
Linda	5	0	Stephen, what is this place?	[]

Mercedes	9	0	Here you go. Porsche will by right with you.	[]
Butters	15	0	Go ahead and have a seat, guys. Ah I've gotta go and find Lexus!	[]
Raisins Girl	7	0	Hey cutie, you having a good time?	[]
Boy	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Stephen	24	0	Oh boy, I think I know what's happened. Our son hasn't learned yet that girls will pretend to like him for money.	[]
Linda	9	0	This place is horrible. To objectify girls like this.	[]
Porsche	7	0	Hi guys. Can I take your order?	[]
Linda	8	0	Little girl, you shouldn't be working here.	[]
Porsche	9	0	I shouldn't? Where I supposed to be working?	[]
Linda	41	0	No, I mean you shouldn't work somewhere where you're paid for how you look. You should be learning a skill so you can grow up to be a businesswoman or even a doctor. Who knows? You could cure cancer.	[]
Porsche	24	0	I could cure cancer? Omigod! That would be sooo cool! I had a cancer sore on my lip once and it hurt sooo bad.	[]
Linda	13	0	... Oh. Never mind, I think Raisins might be the perfect place for you.	[]
Porsche	1	0	Cool!	[]
Butters	5	0	Mom? Dad? This is Lexus.	[]
Lexus	4	0	Hi. Welcome to Raisins.	[]
Stephen	11	0	Uh, Butters, can we have a little talk with you? Outside?	[]
Butters	16	0	Huh? Oh anything you have to say to me  you can say in front of Lexus.	[]
Linda	17	0	Butters, these girls pretend to be interested in you because they know you'll give them tips.	[]
Butters	1	0	Huh?	[]
Stephen	24	0	You see, Butters, women know that they can make men do anything by flirting. And some girls, like these, turn that into a profession.	[]
Butters	88	0	Oh, I see.  You don't approve of my girlfriend!  Well let me tell you somethin', Mom and Dad, our love is as pure as a mountain spring! The odds may be stacked against us, but we're gonna give it our best shot! And so, if you can't be happy for us, y-you can just go to heck, Mom and Dad!  Come on, Lexus. I'm movin' out of my parents' house and I'm movin' in with you. Uh let's blow this joint!	[]
Lexus	12	0	What are you talking about, kid? We are NOT boyfriend and girlfriend.	[]
Butters	17	0	... What? Lexus, what are you saying? Are you saying... you don't want to be together anymore?	[]
Lexus	4	0	I'm sorry, sweetie.	[]
Butters	9	0	So that's it? We're broken up now?	[]
Lexus	9	0	I gotta get these curly fries to Table 12.	[]
Butters	28	0	Well go ahead and go. It's best we don't say anything more. There's nothing left to say. It's over.  Our relationship is o-over.	[]
Goth Voice	15	0	Look at this. Another tortured soul. Another life of pain.  Hey Raven, check it out.	[]
Stan	1	0	Butters?	[]
Butters	5	0	Oh  Uh hey, hey Stan.	[]
Stan	6	0	What's the matter with you?	[]
Butters	9	0	Well, mu mu mu girlfriend broke up with me.	[]
Henrietta	9	0	Did she step on your heart with stiletto heels?	[]
Butters	5	0	Yeah.  It sure does hurt.	[]
Michael	14	0	That's cool. I guess you can join up with us if you want.	[]
Pete	18	0	Yeah. We're gonna go to the graveyard and write poems about death and how pointless life is.	[]
Butters	8	0	Uh, uhm no thanks. I I love life.	[]
Stan	6	0	Huh? But you just got dumped	[]
Butters	84	0	Wuh-ell yeah, and I'm sad, but at the same time I'm really happy that somethin' could make me feel that sad. It's like,  it makes me feel alive, you know? It makes me feel human. And the only way I could feel this sad now is if I felt somethin' really good before. So I have to take the bad with the good, so I guess what I'm feelin' is like a, beautiful sadness. I guess that sounds stupid...	[]
Pete	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Stan	10	0	No. No, Butters, that doesn't sound stupid at all.	[]
Butters	33	2	Well, thanks for offerin' to let me in your clique, guys, uh but, to be honest, I'd rather be a cryin' little pussy than a faggy Goth kid. Well see ya, Stan.	['pussy', 'faggy']
Stan	30	0	He's right. I don't even know who I am anymore. I like liking life a whole lot more than hating it. Screw you guys, I'm goin' home.	[]
Michael	9	0	Go ahead and go back to your sunshine fairytale!	[]
Kyle	11	0	Okay, it's third down. And now, somebody make a play!	[]
Stan	5	0	Hey, can I join in?	[]
Kyle	9	0	What happened? Aren't you still wallowing in pain?	[]
Stan	44	1	Yeah, it still hurts a lot, but ...I just realized that there's gonna be a lot of painful times in life, so, I'd better learn to deal with it the right way.  Hey Wendy!  You're a bitch. Token?  Right here, buddy.	['bitch']
Kyle	12	0	Well. Dude, it's uh it's good to have you back.	[]
Stan	5	0	Yeah. Let's play ball.	[]
