Stan	4	0	Okay, here he comes.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Who wants to tell him?	[]
Cartman	4	0	I'll do it.	[]
Butters	25	0	Hehey, fellas. I'm glad you called me. There was a pie-eating contest down at the firehouse, and I thought we should all go.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Butters, could you take a seat, please?	[]
Butters	3	0	Wuh well, sure.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Butters, we have to have a very difficult conversation.	[]
Butters	4	0	Wull what is it?	[]
Cartman	23	0	Well, in the, in the months since our friend Kenny died, you've really stepped up as a friend and filled the gap.	[]
Butters	13	0	Well uh, it's my pleasure! I love bein' you guys' new friend.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Yes. Well, Butters, it's just not working out.	[]
Butters	3	0	Not working out?	[]
Cartman	18	0	I'm afraid we're gonna have to let you go, as our friend. You're just tooo...	[]
Kyle	1	1	Lame	['lame']
Cartman	2	1	Lame, yes.	['lame']
Butters	7	0	Well, but ah I can get better.	[]
Stan	26	0	Butters, you just don't really fit in with us here. We think it's best for all of us if you for friendship opportunities elsewhere.	[]
Kyle	22	1	But we certainly want to thank you for all your hard work and attempts at being our friend, lame as they were.	['lame']
Butters	20	0	Huh but ah I thought we were gettin' along... great. Heh ah I thought we were really havin' fun together.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Yes, well, we weren't.	[]
Butters	7	0	Please, fellas, uh don't fire me.	[]
Kyle	9	0	We're sorry, Butters.  Our mind is made up.	[]
Cartman	15	0	But we certainly wanna thank you for coming by.  You know the way out, right?	[]
Kyle	1	0	Phew.	[]
"Stan, Cartman"	1	0	Phew.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Hm, I think he took that pretty well, I think.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Who cares?	[]
Stan	20	0	All right, so let's get started on who's gonna be the new person to take Kenny's place.	[]
Butters	136	3	The world isn't fair. I do everything people ask me to. I stand in the lunch line for them, I buy tampons at the store for them, I go on Maury Povich with balls on my chin for them.  And yet, nobody accepts me. I am an outcast. A shadow of a man who can find no companion... ship. No love from others.  Fine!  If I am to be an outcast, so be it!  I'm through doin' what others tell me to do, and I am sick of this world and the stin-, and the stinky people in it!  From now on I will dedicate my life to bringing chaos to the world that has rejected me!  I will become the greatest supervillain  the world has ever seen!  Where I go, destruction will follow!	['tampons', 'balls', 'stinky']
Butters	16	0	Prepare, O little town! Uh prepare for the greatest supervillain you've ever seen! Professor Chaos!	[]
Linda	4	0	Butters, time for bed.	[]
Butters	14	0	Hu-uh, okay Mom.  Yes. Uh sleet sleep for now.  Tomorrow, the chaos begins.	[]
Cartman	95	0	All right, we wanna thank everybody for coming. This is a great turnout.  Uh, as you know, our friend Kenny died a few months ago and we are still looking to fill the void with a new friend. Now, you've all been selected as possible candidates, but unfortunately, there is only room for one of you. So Stan and Kyle and I will be spending the next few days going out with each one of you and narrowing our choices down. Until we think we've found the perfect friend. Are there any questions?	[]
Clyde	10	0	...What if we don't want to be your friend?	[]
Cartman	76	0	Clyde... ... okay. Now, the first thing we have to do is cut the list down from twenty choices to ten. And so today we will all be going to the amusement park together to see who we want to cut. Please keep in mind that this will all be videotaped, so put on your best friend faces, and may the best friend win. Oh, and we will be needing a ten dollar per person entrance fee.	[]
Bennigan's Chef	12	0	Order twenty-three is up, and uh, order twenty-four is up.	[]
Man 1	13	0	Uh, waitress, a-a-actually, I ordered the chicken soup. This is minnestrone.	[]
Man 2	7	0	Yeah, I had the minnestrone over here.	[]
Butters	15	0	I am Professor Chaos, and now, this puny world uh will bow down to me!	[]
Stan	29	0	So today we went to the amusement park with all our possible friends.  It was a really fun time. We rode all the rides and everyone got along great.	[]
Cartman	14	0	I think the person that stood out most at the amusement park was Jimmy.	[]
Jimmy	27	0	Well, the, the reason I think I would make the perfect foreh- friend, is that I love telling jokes. You know, who doesn't like to laugh?	[]
Kyle	20	0	Tweek. Now there's an interesting choice. Tweek has a lot of qualities that I look for in a friend.	[]
Tweek	33	0	What if they don't pick me? What if they get us all, man! I mean, Christ! If they can get to the Pentagon, then they can get to us all, man! Aaaa!	[]
DogPoo	32	0	I think I deserve to take Kenny's place the most, because, I've been hanging around these guys for like five years and I never get to say or do anything.	[]
Cartman	20	0	...Yeah, I've only seen that kid in class, but he never does anything. He's more like a prop.	[]
Kyle	27	0	Towelie is a tough choice because,  even though I can see how always having a towel around can come in handy, he's just always so high.	[]
Towelie	20	0	Man, I really hope I win, because... wait... why is this again? I have no idea what's goin' on.	[]
Cartman	54	1	We decided to get some one-on-one time with Jimmy and ride the log ride.  The great thing was that, because Jimmy's crippled, we got to go to the front of the line.  That was definitely big points for Jimmy, you know, but, but then we got to the ride itself, and...	['crippled']
Jimmy	13	0	Hey, I-I'm gonna need some help getting in the log, fellas.	[]
Ride Operator	7	0	O! Shut her down. Someone needs assistance.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Oh, really?  That's gonna cost some points.	[]
Kyle	29	1	But right now I'd say if we're gonna have a retard for a friend, I, I have to pick Timmy. Because Timmy doesn't tell any jokes.	['retard']
Jimmy	12	0	Boy, isn't this great fellas? Are we great pals or what?	[]
Stan	13	0	One thing for sure: picking our new friend isn't gonna be easy.	[]
Butters	5	0	Kneel. Kneel before Professor Chaos!	[]
Butters	22	0	Ah, the look on their faces when they got the wrong soup. I love bringing chaos!  And that's only the beginning!	[]
Cartman	53	0	All right, everyone. It was a tough decision, but based on our time with you all at the amusement park, we have whittled our choices down to ten.  If you receive a rose, please stay. If you don't, get the fudge out.  Kyle, will you announce the people we want to stay?	[]
Kyle	4	0	Token.  Clyde.  Craig  Timmy	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmih!	[]
Tweek	7	0	Oh man! This is too much pressure!	[]
Kyle	5	0	Pip  Jimmy  Jason  Towelie  Luigi .	[]
Cartman	11	0	Just one more rose left, Kyle. Who does it go to?	[]
Kyle	1	0	Tweek.	[]
Tweek	1	0	Aaarr!	[]
Cartman	13	0	All right, the rest of you, thanks for coming. Get the fudge out!	[]
DogPoo	14	0	I didn't make the cut?? Oh God, I didn't make the cut??	[]
Dougie	14	0	I didn't even get a chance to have them get to know me!	[]
Stan	23	0	All right, congratulations to those of you selected to stay. In the end, one of you will be the new Kenny.  Good luck.	[]
Linda	3	0	Good morning, Butters.	[]
Butters	27	0	It certainly is, Mother. Did ya hear about what's been goin' on? Some horrible new supervillain made somebody get the wrong soup order ot Bennigan's.	[]
Linda	7	0	No,  I didn't hear about that.	[]
Butters	4	0	Yeh, you didn't?	[]
Butters	12	0	Uh Dad, can I uh can I see the newspaper real quick?	[]
Chris	11	0	Why sure, Butters. I was just about to get some breakfast.	[]
Butters	36	0	Nothing.  Nothing!  It's the liberal media! They're keeping the stories of my deeds covered up, so as not to cause a panic. Well, I guess it's time to take it up a notch!	[]
Stan	2	0	Okay, next?	[]
Kyle	4	0	This looks pretty good.	[]
Stan	6	0	Yeah, it's not bad. Next?	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmay!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Next?	[]
Cartman	36	0	Okay, so now we're gonna see how you all work as a friend during classtime. Your performances will be judged primarily on how you help us cheat and give us answers. So good luck, everybody.	[]
Ms. Choksondik	3	0	Sit down, boys.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Alrighty then.	[]
Ms. Choksondik	34	0	All right, children, before we get started, has anybody seen the eraser for the chalkboard?  It probably got knocked on the floor somewhere. Can you all just please look around your desks for it?	[]
Butters	69	0	Yes. Look around for your precious eraser. You won't find it. That eraser's in my back yard, buried three feet below the surface of the earth.  And do you even suspect me?? No! Now we shall all see how you all like your dear chalkboard without an eraser.  And information, it just keeps pilin' up and pilin' up, until your minuscule brains can take it no longer!	[]
Ms. Choksondik	26	0	No? Oh, oh well. Never mind. I've got a backup one in the desk.  Okay, today children, we're gonna learn about multiplying times five.	[]
Butters	12	0	So! You all think that you can outsmart Professor Chaos, do you?!	[]
Ms. Choksondik	20	0	Now, whenever we multiply a number times five, the result is going to end in a zero or a five.	[]
Butters	2	0	Ms. Choksondik,	[]
Ms. Choksondik	4	0	What is it, Butters?	[]
Butters	11	0	Ah, I need to go to the bathroom. R-really bad.	[]
Ms. Choksondik	14	0	Oh alright Butters. Take the bathroom pass and go.  Okay, so for instance, children-	[]
Butters	19	0	Alright. I'm goin' to the bathroom now. If anybody needs me, ah that's where I'll be.	[]
Ms. Choksondik	13	0	Just go, Butters.  Okay, so for instance, five times one is... what, Eric?	[]
Cartman	6	0	Uh, what's the question again?	[]
Ms. Choksondik	3	0	Five... times...  one.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Five times one is of course...	[]
The Class	1	0	Five.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Five.	[]
Butters	11	0	The time for fun and games is over, feeble-minded fools!	[]
Ms. Choksondik	3	0	Who are you?	[]
Butters	32	0	I am Professor Chaos! Bringer of destruction and maker of doom! Those who do not know me yet shall know me very soon, for the hour of Chaos ih-is at hand!	[]
Ms. Choksondik	11	0	Hey! That kid took my last eraser!  Come back here, kid!	[]
Butters	16	0	Oh! Ah, I'm back from the bathroom. Ah I really let one go in there.	[]
Ms. Choksondik	11	0	Butters, did you see another little kid run out of here?	[]
Butters	49	2	Why yes, I did. But he pushed me down and I scraped my elbow.  Go on and look at it. It's scraped. Look.  Yeesss. Go on and see the red mark on my elbow, the red mark I made myself to throw you off Professor Chaos's trail.	['scraped', 'scraped']
Ms. Choksondik	11	0	It looks fine, Butters.  Okay, hold on and stay here, children.	[]
Kyle	6	0	You're such a fatass, Cartman!	[]
Cartman	8	1	Oh yeah?! Well, you're a stupid Jew!	['jew']
Stan	3	0	Shut up, fatass!	[]
Craig	7	0	Oh, aaaah, well you guys are dumb.	[]
Cartman	12	0	Okay, Craig, interesting choice. Powerful stuff there, Craig. Thank you very much.	[]
Butters	47	0	It is almost ...complete. The creation of my minions who will assist me in bringing terror to the world.  There we go.  Ye-ess, my minions of, of chaos.  Shhh. Night now, night now my lovelies. Your time to bring dest-struction will come very soon.  Aaahhh!	[]
Linda	11	0	Butters, a note for you was left on the front door.	[]
Butters	2	0	A note?	[]
Linda	16	0	Here you go.  And wash your hands after you touch those hamster - you'll get AIDS	[]
Butters	47	0	Okay, Mom.  So. Someone has discovered my horrible secret. This could be a trap set by the FBI. Oh, I'll be at the docks, precious FBI! But it is I who'll have the trap set for you! Come, my minions!  We haven't much time!	[]
Cartman	42	1	All right, everyone, the time has come for us to narrow the list down from ten to six. But first, let us just say that the people who we didn't pick were only not picked because they totally sucked balls. Kyle?	['balls']
Pip	13	0	They're not going to pick me. I just know they're not.	[]
Tweek	9	0	O-oh Jesus! Aaah I can't take it!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Token.	[]
Token	2	0	All right!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Timmy.	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmay!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Tweek.  Pip	[]
Pip	6	0	Really? I don't believe it.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Towelie.	[]
Towelie	1	0	What?	[]
Cartman	5	0	Just one more rose, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Jimmy.	[]
Jimmy	5	0	Oh boy! Oh thank God!	[]
Cartman	22	0	All right, those with roses will move on to the swimsuit and talent competition. The rest of you, get the fudge out!	[]
Clyde	20	0	This whole thing is stupid! You don't pick people you wanna be with by making it into a game!	[]
Cartman	31	1	Ooooooo, somebody's a sore loser! Clyde, I believe I said, get the fudge out! Which means, kiss mah fudgin' ass, go fudge yourself, fudge ya, get the fudge out, Clyde!	['ass']
Dougie	2	0	Hey Butters.	[]
Butters	11	0	Oh, hey Dougie.  Oh I mean, my name is Professor Chaos.	[]
Dougie	15	0	I saw you change in the school bathroom. You stole that eraser in your class.	[]
Butters	38	0	Very well. You called out Professor Chaos, and you also called out, eh your own demise!  Go now, my minions. Go and take this, this foolish mortal down!  Aw minions, naw, not that way. He-  come back minions.	[]
Dougie	15	0	I'm, not trying to call you out, Professor Chaos. I want to join you.	[]
Butters	2	0	Join me?	[]
Dougie	11	0	Yeah I want to join you in your conquest of destruction.	[]
Butters	2	0	But why?	[]
Dougie	22	0	I'm an outcast, too. A frail child cast aside by society. I want to follow you and... whatever you're doing.	[]
Butters	31	0	Uh very well. You shall be my accomplice in evil. Together, we shall bring the world to its knees! A-and make all those who banished us from society run... red.	[]
Dougie	12	0	Do I get a neato costume made out of aluminum foil, too?	[]
Butters	21	0	Well sure you do. Ah I am professor, and you shall be my general. From now on you are General... Disarray.	[]
Dougie	2	0	General Disarray.	[]
Butters	16	0	Now let us go look for my minions!  They ran away here, now to find 'em...	[]
Cartman	14	0	The swimsuit competition really gave us a fresh look at some of the candidates.	[]
Jimmy	65	0	Well, I don't think I did too well in the... bathing suit competition. But I can't wait for the talent show competition. That'll really my chance to... shine.  Wow, what a terrific audience. So anyway, a guy walks into a buh- ...A guy walks into a b- ...buh...  A guy walks into a guy walks into a  babuh ba-a-a, uh-	[]
Towelie	5	0	Okay wait...  No, no wait.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Next please.	[]
Token	7	0	Well, what am I supposed to do?	[]
Kyle	6	0	Anything that'll impress us, Token.	[]
Cartman	11	0	If you were our friend, how would you keep us entertained?	[]
Token	4	0	Aaaah. Oh, I know.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Very nice.	[]
Stan	3	0	I like it.	[]
Kyle	27	0	Well Token was a definite winner for talent show. But then we decided to take everyone to a baseball game, to see how we got along there.	[]
Announcer	13	0	There goes a hit to left field, and Foley's going to score.	[]
All	1	0	Woohoo!	[]
Kyle	5	0	Yeah! Isn't this great?!	[]
Vendor	5	0	Kids, get your drinks here.	[]
Pip	8	0	Eho! Yes. Can I have some tea, please?	[]
Cartman	13	1	You don't drink tea in a ballpark, you French piece of crap!	['crap']
Pip	7	0	Oh, very well. Just some crumpets, then.	[]
Cartman	11	0	All right, that does it! Pip, get the fudge out! Next!	[]
Stan	5	0	Okay, let's try this.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Hey, what's wrong with the Jumbotron?	[]
Butters	57	0	People of Earth! Your meaningless lives are about to end! I am Professor Chaos,  and this is my partner ih-in evil, General Disarray! In the past few days I have rained terror down upon the society that shunned me! And now it is time for my Labor of Lonely! I am going to... flood... the world!	[]
Man 3	3	0	Flood the world?	[]
Man 4	2	0	My God!	[]
Woman	10	0	I don't wanna die,  I DON'T WANNA DIE!	[]
Butters	59	0	Oh yes. Every living creature and every sacred building will soon be under leagues and leagues of cold and dark water. And there is nothing you can do to stop me! General Disarray, begin the flooding of Earth!  You brought this upon yourselves! You made the outcasts of the world! Now watch! Watch as your precious planet drowns! Watch!	[]
Man 5	6	0	Jesus Christ, who will save us?	[]
Man 6	17	0	We have very little time to live. How, how shall we spend our last hours on earth?	[]
Fans	3	0	Yeah! All right!	[]
Butters	22	0	Our reign of terror is complete! Our tur- turmoil has now come full circle!  Hey, is the hose on full, General Disarray?	[]
Dougie	6	0	It's on all the way.	[]
Butters	20	0	Oh. Alright then. Nothing to do now but watch the world die!  Boy, this sure is takin' a long time.	[]
Stan	13	0	Okay, so how do we all feel about Towelie as our new friend?	[]
Cartman	5	0	I think Towelie is awesome.	[]
Kyle	19	0	Towelie is cool, but he gets stoned all the time. You can't really rely on him for anything.	[]
Stan	7	0	Oh, this is giving me a headache.	[]
Kyle	29	0	Eh now,  come on, you guys, we can't take this decision lightly. Whoever we pick is going to be the person we do everything with from now on.	[]
Stan	16	0	You're right. Well now, how about Timmy?  He's quiet and he takes direction well.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Yeah, but Timmy can be really self-centered.	[]
Stan	3	0	How about Token?	[]
Cartman	4	1	Token's a smartass.	['smartass']
Kyle	5	1	So? You're a smartass!	['smartass']
Cartman	7	0	Yeah. Do we really need another one?	[]
Kyle	2	0	Good point.	[]
Jimmy	20	0	Hey fellas. I was just in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to s-gif- gift basket.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Oh, thanks Jimmy	[]
Jimmy	14	0	There's some chocolates and lih-licorice, and some games and peh- pencils inside.	[]
Stan	3	0	That's great.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Cool.	[]
Jimmy	12	0	Yeah well, I guess I'll be seeing you, you friends later.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Alright Jimmy, see ya.	[]
Stan	1	0	Suckup.	[]
Butters	12	0	Not long now, General Disarray, and... our horrible plan will be complete.	[]
Dougie	32	0	Hey, do you think maybe we should build a boat? You know, like a little raft or something, so that when the world floods you and me and the minions can live?	[]
Butters	24	0	Oh yeah. I hadn't thought o' that. That's a pretty good idea. I'll go get a hammer.  Hey, who is that?	[]
Worker 1	3	0	Is this it?	[]
Worker 2	7	0	Yeah, two thirteen, that's the one.	[]
Butters	17	0	Heeyyy, what are you doin'?  Aaaah! You may have won this time! But I will be back!	[]
Dougie	5	0	What do we do now?	[]
Butters	36	0	Well I had another idea of how to kill the world, but I thought it was... almost too horrible to e- to even speak of, but-  but now they have left me with no other choice!	[]
Cartman	27	0	Well, this is it. We have made our final decision and one of you is who we will be spending our childhood with, as our new friend.	[]
Jimmy	7	0	Oh puh please. Oh, Oh God... please.	[]
Cartman	18	0	Four friends, just one rose. The moment of truth is here. Kyle? Who does the rose go to?	[]
Butters	7	0	This is, General Disarray. My final solution.	[]
Dougie	10	0	What evil plot do you have this time, Professor Chaos?	[]
Butters	58	0	Simple, my dear general. We are going to tear down the Earth's precious atmosphere! Oh yes! My latest plan will melt the polar ice caps, a-and burn all the world with the, with the... hu- sun's harmful rays!  Say goodbye to your... precious ozone and hello to chaos!  Okay, hand me another one, General Disarray.	[]
Announcer	56	0	Will Professor Chaos's latest plot succeed and be the final undoing of Earth?  And which boy has been chosen to be the replacement for Kenny?  And which of these six South Park residents was killed, and will never be seen again?  The answer to those questions will be answered... right now.  No.  Tweek.  Ms. Choksondik.	[]
