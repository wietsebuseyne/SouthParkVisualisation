Mrs. Garrison	93	0	Okay, children, this week we are all going to learn about parenting.  I'm going to pair all the boys and girls in class into couples, and give each couple...  an egg. You must care for and look after this egg just like a baby for one full week. If you break your egg, it means you have a dead baby, and if you kill your baby, you get an F. When I announce your names, please move and sit with the person you're paired with.  Heidi, you'll be with Eric.	[]
Heidi	1	0	Awww!	[]
Mrs. Garrison	8	0	Annie, you'll be a family with Timmy.	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmiih!	[]
Mrs. Garrison	14	0	Millie, your husband is Craig. Powder, you and Kenny are a loving couple now.	[]
Stan	10	0	Oh no, dude, he's gonna put me with Wendy.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(So?)	[]
Mrs. Garrison	10	0	Aaand let's see who else we have here, uh...	[]
Stan	12	0	So, I haven't even spoken to Wendy since we broke up.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	7	0	And, Wendy? Wendy will be with Kyle.	[]
Stan	1	0	Kyle??	[]
Mrs. Garrison	214	0	Bebe, you're paired up with Stan. Lola and Token, Red and Craig, and Esther and Bradley.  Now, I'm going to sign each of your eggs myself, so that we'll know it's the same one at the end of the week. That way if anybody cheats and tries to replace their eggs, we'll know, Eric.  All you have to do is make it to Friday with your egg unharmed to prove what great little parents you are.  Okay children, you can now take the rest of the school period to decorate your egg however you wish. Good luck, and remember, a dead baby means an F for the parents.  Just look at all these little families Newfound couples in a happy home. It takes me back to another time When I had a love of my own.  Love, love lost long ago, it was special then, it's over now. Love, so darn frail, you know? It shriveled and died. I don't know how. Love, love lost long ago, it was special then, it's over now. Guess that I'll never know how it all went wrong. How how how?  Well perhaps I should try and boldly go and rekindle that love lost long ago. Hello, Mr. Slave.	[]
Mr. Slave	4	0	Mr. Garrison! Ohoh, Jezuth!	[]
Mrs. Garrison	36	1	Just let me say what I came here to say. I know we had a falling out and... things were said that... shouldn't have been said. I want to apologize for calling you a faggot.	['faggot']
Mr. Slave	7	0	That's, that's wonderful, Mr. Garrison!	[]
Mrs. Garrison	33	1	Well, wait, wait, it gets better. I've forgiven you for walking out on me after I had my sex change, and uh...  And I'm ready to take you back, Mr. Slave!	['sex']
Mr. Slave	1	0	Ooooo...	[]
Mrs. Garrison	5	0	Well, give us a kiss!	[]
Big Gay Al	6	0	Say, honey, is that the pizza?	[]
Mrs. Garrison	7	1	What the hell is he doing here?!	['hell']
Mr. Slave	13	0	Mr. Garrison, Al and I have been living together for a few months.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	9	0	Well, that didn't take you long, did it?!	[]
Big Gay Al	7	0	Slave, should I leave you two alone?	[]
Mrs. Garrison	1	0	Yes!	[]
Mr. Slave	15	0	No!  Mr. Garrison, there's something you should know. Al and I are getting married.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	1	0	Married?!	[]
Big Gay Al	1	0	Yes.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	8	1	You can't get married! You're faggots!	['faggots']
Mr. Slave	3	0	Oh, Jesus Christ.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	18	0	Mr. Slave, I am legally a woman now! If you wanna get married, you have to marry ME!	[]
Big Gay Al	17	1	Oh that's not true! Colorado is about to pass a bill which allows same-sex marriage.	['sex']
Mr. Slave	11	0	We're getting married right after the bill passes on Saturday.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	15	2	Oh, that's just great! They're gonna let queers and homos get married, huh?!	['queers', 'homos']
Mr. Slave	7	0	Okay, that's enough. Out, Mr. Garrison.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	17	2	We'll just see about this, you fudge-packin' fags!! I'll stop that gay-marriage law!	['fags', 'gay']
Mr. Slave	12	0	Oh my God, you're just saying that because you're jealous.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	24	1	Jealous of what?! I'm doin' this out of principle! To protect the sanctity of marriage!  Fags are gettin' married over MY DEAD BODY!!	['fags']
Kyle	4	0	Hello? Oh hey dude.	[]
Stan	7	0	So, what are you and Wendy doing?	[]
Kyle	32	0	Oh, we're just makin' a cradle out of an egg carton for our egg. We figure that way it'll be easier to keep safe so we can get an A.	[]
Stan	2	0	Uh huh...	[]
Kyle	20	0	I don't think it's gonna be that hard to keep it from breaking. This whole assignment is stupid.	[]
Stan	6	0	Yeah, well, so is your hat.	[]
Bebe	11	0	Stan, I need you to watch the egg for a while.	[]
Stan	6	0	I can't. I'm busy.	[]
Bebe	20	0	I've been looking after it all day. I have to go to the hair salon and the candy store!	[]
Stan	5	0	...So take it with you!	[]
Bebe	14	0	Stan, this is our egg. We're both supposed to take care of it.	[]
Stan	14	0	Well maybe I didn't want to have an egg with you, okay Bebe?!	[]
Bebe	29	0	Well whether you wanted to or not doesn't really matter now! We're going to get graded together! It's your egg too! Own up to your responsibilities!	[]
Mrs. Garrison	25	1	These homosexuals think they can just step all over our traditions! Well I say: Marriage is a holy sacrament between a man and a woman!	['homosexuals']
Woman	4	0	Who is that lady?	[]
Man	8	0	I don't know, but she is pissed.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	81	6	They passed this law behind our back! We need to tell the governor and the world that gay marriage is not okay! That homosexuals cannot muddy our traditions! And there is only one way for us, all together, to make that message very clear! We need to round up three or four queers and beat the livin' hell out of them!  Come on, everybody! Let's get some queers, and some trucks, and have us a good old-fashioned fag drag!	['gay', 'homosexuals', 'queers', 'hell', 'queers', 'fag']
Man 2	15	0	Well uh, we were thinkin' we would, you know, just go appeal to the Governor.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	13	2	Appeal to the Governor? Oh,come on! Where's your balls?! Fag drag!	['balls', 'fag']
Man 3	18	1	We don't hate homosexuals, we, we we just don't want them to be able to marry.	['homosexuals']
Man 4	15	0	Yeah, we were just thinkin' o' goin' and askin' the Governor to veto the bill.	[]
Man 5	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	4	1	Eh fah, fag drag?	['fag']
Mrs. Garrison	16	1	Governor, we have collected over one thousand signatures requesting that you veto this gay-marriage bill!	['gay']
Governor	42	1	Oh jeez, I knew this would happen. First the gay people come in here wanting equal rights, then this bill gets passed and now all the people against it want me to veto it. > Why do I have to make this decision?? />	['gay']
Mrs. Garrison	5	0	Because you're the governor?	[]
Governor	41	1	I just wanted a big house and lots of respect. I didn't want this kind of responsibility.  I mean, I don't know anything about gay marriage. What argument can I use to deny them their right to a family?	['gay']
Mrs. Garrison	32	2	Well, think of the children! If you allow gays to get married, then you're also givin' them full rights as parents to adopt. You think kids can be raised by queers??	['gays', 'queers']
Governor	18	0	I can't use that argument. There's never been a study done which proves that either way.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	21	1	But, if you had such a study, a scientific study which proved same-sex couples are incapable of raising a child...	['sex']
Governor	19	0	Then I would have something to fall back on. So-something to take all the pressure off of me.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	8	0	Mr. Governor, I will get you that study.	[]
Bebe	7	0	Hey Wendy, how's your egg doing?	[]
Wendy	15	0	Oh great. It's a pretty easy project. Kyle's really good with the egg.	[]
Bebe	39	0	Yeah.  I wish I had a partner like Kyle! I went to go pick up the egg from Stan yesterday, and his dog had it in its mouth! Our egg isn't gonna last a week with Stan around!	[]
Mrs. Garrison	37	0	Okay, students, change of plan!  You've all been doing a great job taking care of your eggs, but now we're going to mix it up a little. Wendy and Kyle will no longer be together.	[]
Stan	1	0	HA!	[]
Mrs. Garrison	32	1	Let's see what happens when we put two same-sex couples together to take care of an egg, shall we?! Kyle, you are now with Stan! And Wendy is with Bebe!	['sex']
Kyle	1	0	Why?	[]
Mrs. Garrison	15	0	Come on, Bebe. We'll take your egg for you and Wendy to look after.	[]
Bebe	2	0	Oh, goodie.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	15	0	And we'll just take this egg for Stan and Kyle to look out for.	[]
Wendy	6	0	No. No, that's my egg.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	10	0	Wendy, we're doing an experiment.  Here you go, boys.	[]
Wendy	20	0	But I made that egg. Mr. Garrison, please. Youyou can't give my egg to Stan, he'll break it.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	35	1	Hoh now, what makes you say that, Wendy? I'm sure two boys can handle an egg just fine...  And if not, we'll certainly prove a point to that goddamned Governor, won't we?	['goddamned']
Kyle	1	0	Who?	[]
Mrs. Garrison	15	0	Never mind, just carry on, children. Just carry on as two reckless little boys will.	[]
Kyle	16	0	Okay, there. Now we can carry this egg around in this case without it getting cracked.	[]
Stan	11	0	Alright, give it to me. I'll take it home tonight.	[]
Kyle	12	0	Look, Stan, you want me to just take care of this egg?	[]
Stan	5	0	Why do you say that?	[]
Kyle	20	0	It's just that... I really need this A, Stan. And Bebe did say you almost broke your last egg.	[]
Stan	7	0	That's because I was pissed off!	[]
Kyle	5	0	At who?  Heh- hang on.	[]
Wendy	5	0	I wanna see my egg.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Huh?	[]
Wendy	6	0	I want to see my egg.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Wendy, it isn't your egg anymore!	[]
Wendy	9	0	Yes it is. I made it, I decorated it.	[]
Kyle	27	0	Well, you might have made it, but we're the ones who are taking care of it now. You have your own egg to look out for!	[]
Wendy	11	0	...I just wanna hold my egg for a couple of minutes.	[]
Kyle	20	0	Wendy, I just wanna get an A, okay? Let's not make this any more confusing than it already is. <>	[]
Wendy	8	0	Don't let anything happen to it, please.	[]
Kyle	25	0	Wendy, nothing's gonna happen to the egg. You can have it when the week is over and I have my grade.  Freakin' weirdos, man.	[]
Stan	47	0	You think you're so great, don't you?! Well guess what?! Maybe I don't need your help! I'm taking the egg home tonight, and I'm gonna show everybody tomorrow that I'm every bit as good an egg-take-care-over as you!	[]
Kyle	7	1	What the hell is wrong with everybody?	['hell']
Mrs. Garrison	14	0	Okay, children, it's Wednesday! Time for an official egg check! Heidi and Eric?	[]
Heidi	4	0	Our egg is fine.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	4	0	Okay, Annie and Timmy?	[]
Timmy	1	0	TimmiIH!	[]
Mrs. Garrison	12	0	Good. Millie and Clyde, I saw yours before class.  Powder and Kenny?	[]
Kenny	4	0	(Our egg is okay.)	[]
Mrs. Garrison	9	1	Now how about our gay couples? Stan and Kyle?	['gay']
Stan	1	0	Fine!	[]
Mrs. Garrison	1	0	What?	[]
Stan	4	0	No problems at all!	[]
Mrs. Garrison	20	0	That's impossible!  Are you sure you didn't break it and switch eggs on me?! Where's my signature?!	[]
Stan	5	0	It's right there, see?	[]
Mrs. Garrison	10	0	Two boys can't possibly take care of an egg!	[]
Kyle	5	0	Dude, it's totally fine.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	53	2	It isn't fine! It has two daddies! You call that fine?! It may be fine on the outside, but inside it's confused and embarrassed! Look at the freak egg! It has two daddies!  Two daddies! Two daddies! Come on, class, let's rip on the freak egg! Two daddies! Two daddies!	['freak', 'freak']
Field Reporter	53	2	Tom, I'm standing outside the Governor's office, where in just two days, the Governor can either sign or veto the new bill allowing gay marriage. Same-sex couples from all over the state have shown up in support,  while dissenters have also converged. The governor is about to give a statement.	['gay', 'sex']
Governor	114	7	I believe that I might have come up with a compromise to this whole problem that will make everyone happy! People in the gay community want the same rights as married couples, but dissenters don't want the word marriage corrupted. So how about we let gay people get married, but call it something else?  You homosexuals will have all exactly the same rights as married couples, but instead of referring to you as married, you can be... butt buddies.  Instead of being man and wife, you'll be... butt buddies. You won't be betrothed, you'll be... butt buddies. Get it? Instead of a bride and groom, you'd be... butt buddies.	['gay', 'gay', 'homosexuals', 'butt', 'butt', 'butt', 'butt']
Mr. Slave	5	0	We wanna be treated equally!	[]
Governor	21	1	Y-you are equal. It's just that instead of getting engaged, you would be... butt buuuddies. And everyone is happy!	['butt']
Woman	4	0	Well what about lesbians?!	[]
Governor	15	1	Well like anyone cares about fuckin' dykes.  Oh, God, I was sure that would work.	['fuckin']
Mrs. Garrison	27	4	Damnit, damnit! Stan and Kyle's egg is still doin' fine! Those little assholes are screwin' up my entire plan!  Yes, what?!  What the hell is this?!	['damnit', 'damnit', 'assholes', 'hell']
Cartman	4	0	I broke the egg.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	12	0	You broke your egg?? Uh but you're partnered with a girl.	[]
Cartman	36	0	I tried to cover it up, tried to put it back together with modeling glue, tried to seal it with a soldering gun, but, I give up. I can't hide it, I broke the egg.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	7	0	Did you tell anyone else about this?	[]
Cartman	1	0	...No.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	7	0	Did you tell your egg partner, Heidi?	[]
Cartman	56	0	No. That's why I'm here. I think you should still give Heidi an A on the project. You see, I broke the egg, not her. And so, I should get an F, and she should get an A, which means that together the grade should average out to C minus for both of us.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	6	0	I can't do that, Eric!	[]
Cartman	14	1	Damnit! I knew you'd say that! You always have it out for me!	['damnit']
Mrs. Garrison	48	0	You have to get an A, Eric. Here: I'll sign this new egg for you. We'll pretend this never happened, all right?  Just... put on the old hair, color in the same eyes... There we go, good as new.  Go enjoy the rest of your recess.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Mr. Garrison..., you've never been this cool to me before.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	10	0	...Okay, well, you're welcome, Eric. Now, just run along.	[]
Cartman	5	0	...Why are you doing this?	[]
Mrs. Garrison	8	0	Because I'm a nice teacher, all right?	[]
Cartman	6	0	What do you want from me?	[]
Mrs. Garrison	10	1	Nothing! It's all okay! Just take your damn egg!	['damn']
Cartman	1	0	...No.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	37	0	Eric, you've never been anything but a problem for me! You're taking that egg! And if you break it again, I'll break both your legs, and burn down your house! Do you hear me?!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Yes teacher.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	25	0	Get out of my face!  Urrgh, this scientific study isn't turning out the way I planned! Looks like I'm gonna have to... intervene.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	3	0	Are you Jakartha?	[]
Jakartha	5	1	Who the hell are you?!	['hell']
Mrs. Garrison	10	0	Mrs. Garrison. I spoke to your associates on the telephone.	[]
Jakartha	8	0	Ahh yes, you are interested in my services.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	16	0	I have a little... problem I need taken care of. I heard you're the best.	[]
Jakartha	10	0	Who do you want me to kill?  What is this?	[]
Mrs. Garrison	4	0	It's an egg.	[]
Jakartha	7	0	You want me to kill an egg?	[]
Mrs. Garrison	13	0	I can pay two thousand now, three more when the job is finished.	[]
Jakartha	9	0	What do you expect me to do with it?	[]
Mrs. Garrison	19	0	I don't care. Scramble it, fry it, do what you will! It has to look like an accident.	[]
Jakartha	10	0	I am a serious assassin! Get out of my face!	[]
Mrs. Garrison	41	0	What's the matter? You... afraid you can't do it? Can't say that I blame ya. That egg has caused me nothin' but problems since day one!  I guess... you're not as good as they say you are...	[]
Jakartha	10	0	I am the greatest killer the world has ever seen!!	[]
Mrs. Garrison	9	0	Then why are you scared of one little egg?!	[]
Jakartha	16	0	I will murder that egg! Then I will make it curse the day it was laid!	[]
Mrs. Garrison	5	0	That's more like it!	[]
Stan	6	0	Day five. I made it!  Hello?	[]
Kyle	7	0	Dude, did you hear what's happening?	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Kyle	25	0	Garrison is taking us all on a field trip today. He wants to do the final egg check in front of the Governor's office!	[]
Stan	3	0	Governor's office?	[]
Kyle	25	0	She's really taking this grade seriously, Stan. I'm gonna come over so that we can take our egg to school together, all right?	[]
Stan	17	0	Aah, you'd like that, wouldn't you?! I took care of this egg, Kyle, not you!	[]
Kyle	14	1	Okay, Stan, you've been an asshole to me all week! What is up?!	['asshole']
Stan	21	1	What's up?! Oh, nothing except that you've been trying to impress Wendy all week long like a pathetic dickhole!	['dickhole']
Kyle	2	0	Impress Wendy??	[]
Stan	20	0	You've set it all up to look like you're this awesome prince and I'm just a loser!	[]
Kyle	7	1	What the hell are you talking about?!	['hell']
Stan	35	0	Well guess what?! I'm gonna take this egg to class myself! And I'm gonna hold it up in front of Wendy, and say See?! I'm every bit as good as Kyle is.	[]
Jakartha	3	0	Almost too easy.	[]
Stan	1	0	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Stan?	[]
Stan	2	0	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!	[]
Kyle	7	0	Stan? Stan, I think we should talk.	[]
Stan	11	0	Dude, you should just go be with Wendy and be happy.	[]
Kyle	18	0	Stan, I don't like Wendy.  All I cared about was getting an A in this stupid project!	[]
Stan	18	0	Yeah well, I blew it. Now we're gonna fail and Wendy thinks I'm a total loser.	[]
Kyle	9	0	I thought you didn't care about Wendy anymore.	[]
Stan	7	1	I don't. She's totally lame.	['lame']
Kyle	21	0	Stan, there was never anything between Wendy and I.  I wouldn't go out with my best friend's ex-girlfriend.	[]
Stan	19	1	I'm sorry I didn't trust you, Kyle. I'm obviously just a crappy best friend to have.	['crappy']
Kyle	12	0	Yyeah well, I-I'm sorry I didn't trust you either.	[]
Stan	1	0	Huh?	[]
Kyle	36	0	It was really important for me to get an A, Stan. And Bebe said you were so reckless with your egg, so I made a fake one for you  and kept the original safe with me.	[]
Stan	10	0	That...  That's the real egg with Garrison's signature?	[]
Kyle	5	0	Yeah dude. I'm sorry.	[]
Stan	11	0	Then... then Wendy won't think I'm a total loser!	[]
Kyle	8	0	Yeah. And I can still get my A!	[]
Stan	6	0	Come on, buddy, let's go!	[]
Kyle	9	0	Stan...  Do you really think my hat is stupid?	[]
Stan	18	0	As a matter of fact,... I think it is the nicest hat I've ever known.  Come on!	[]
Governor	53	1	Today is a very big day in which I'm supposed to make a very big decision. As some of you know, my biggest issue with gay marriage regards child-rearing. And a new study has just been concluded which will give me the ability to take no personal responsibility in this decision.	['gay']
Big Gay Al	3	0	A new study?	[]
Governor	12	0	Here with the results of that study is the lovely Mrs. Garrison.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	3	0	Thank you, Governor.	[]
Mr. Slave	3	0	Oh, Jesus Christ.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	41	1	Ladies and Gentlemen, with the help of some adorable fourth-grade students, we've completed our scientific, non-biased study of fags having kids. Come on up, children.  The parents were grouped together as male and female. As you can see...	['fags']
Aide	9	0	Uh, Mrs. Garrison. You have an emergency phone call.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	9	0	Yes, what is it?! I'm a little busy!	[]
Kyle	18	0	Mr. Garrison, it's Kyle! Our egg is okay! We'll be there in a couple of minutes!	[]
Mrs. Garrison	7	0	What?? Y-your... you're too late!	[]
Kyle	9	0	Don't fail us! We'll be right there!	[]
Mrs. Garrison	13	1	No you can'- Hello? Hello!!  You told me you killed that freak egg!!	['freak']
Jakartha	5	0	I was sure I did!	[]
Mrs. Garrison	34	1	Well it's here! You'd better make damn sure it doesn't reach these steps uncracked!  Haha, anyhow, as I was saying, we put one egg into the hands of two male students.	['damn']
Kyle	2	0	Thanks dude!	[]
Stan	8	0	There! Over there!  Excuse us! Excuse us please!	[]
Jakartha	1	0	Yeeeeaah!	[]
Stan	2	0	Jesus Christ!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Keep running!	[]
Mrs. Garrison	10	0	The the egg that the two boys were given just-	[]
Kyle	3	0	Hang on! Wait!	[]
Mrs. Garrison	8	0	In conclusion, Governor, you can rest assured that-!	[]
Stan	5	0	Teacher, our egg is... okay.	[]
Governor	8	1	This egg is fine.  Gays can get married!	['gays']
Mrs. Garrison	2	0	Noo! Noooo!!	[]
Kyle	5	1	Gays can get married? What??	['gays']
Fr. Maxi	7	0	I now pronounce you man... and man.	[]
Randy	16	0	Boys, I'm really proud of you. You've done an amazing thing for marriage rights.	[]
Kyle	4	0	What did we do?	[]
Wendy	13	0	Stan, I'm sorry I doubted you. You really made a great dad.	[]
Stan	10	1	Like I give a crap about what you think, Wendy.	['crap']
Mrs. Garrison	42	0	Love, love lost long ago, it was special then, it's over now. Guess that I'll never know how it all went wrong. How how how? Well perhaps I should try and boldly go and rekindle that love lost long ago.	[]
