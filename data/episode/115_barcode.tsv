Cartman	10	0	Captain Cartman reporting from Shuttlecraft Spontaneity. Approaching planet Omega Nine.	[]
Stan	6	0	Warp drive disengaged. Landing sequence initiated.	[]
Cartman	12	1	What kind of atmosphere are you reading on the planet surface, Jew?	['jew']
Kyle	4	0	I'm a Vulcan!	[]
Cartman	11	1	All right, what kind of atmosphere are you reading, Vulcan Jew?	['jew']
Kyle	9	0	The atmosphere is oxygen-based, should support our breathing.	[]
Cartman	30	1	All right, hang on. We're about to land.  Okay, First Officer Stan and Engineer Kenny, you come with me on the away team. Vulcan Jew Kyle will wait here.	['jew']
Kyle	8	0	No! I'm on the away team too!	[]
Cartman	13	0	It's my Mom's new minivan, so I'm the captain, Kyle!	[]
Kyle	14	0	I don't care! You're not making me wait in the van again!	[]
Cartman	18	0	Fine, Kyle! But if something goes wrong out there on the planet surface, don't hold me responsible.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Set phasers on stun.	[]
Stan	4	0	Things seem pretty quiet.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Yes. A little too quiet.	[]
Kyle	24	0	I am picking up carbon-based life forms in Sector C. I believe we will find a village of peaceful aliens over that ridge.	[]
Cartman	27	0	Okay, fine, I guess we'll look for- Oh no!! Look out! It's a giant four-headed lava frog! Shoot it!  Oh no, it got Kyle!	[]
Kyle	4	0	No it doesn't.	[]
Cartman	21	0	Aw, it got Kyle and it's tearing his head off!  Aw you guys, it looks like Kyle is done for!	[]
Kyle	16	1	No I'm not! God damn it Cartman, you're not gonna kill me off again!	['damn']
Cartman	22	1	Agh! You see guys, this is why you don't bring Jews along on the away team: they don't play along!	['jews']
Kyle	10	1	Shut up about Jews, fatass! You don't know anything!	['jews']
Stan	6	0	Oh God, here we go again.	[]
Cartman	21	1	Oh yeah?! I saw Mel Gibson's movie, The Passion, and Mel Gibson says, in the movie, Jews are the Devil!	['jews']
Kyle	3	0	He does not!	[]
Cartman	53	1	How do you know?! I've seen The Passion thirty-four times now, Kyle! You haven't seen it once! There's even one part where the Jews have a chance to save Jesus, and you know what they do? They let Barabbas, a serial killer, go free instead and laugh about it.	['jews']
Kyle	2	0	Naw uh!	[]
Cartman	5	0	Go see the movie, Kyle!	[]
Stan	18	0	That does it! I'm sick of you guys arguing about The Passion! I'm out of here.	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Me too!)	[]
Kyle	12	1	I'm not arguing about The Passion! He's being an asshole!	['asshole']
Cartman	34	1	You know what it is? You're scared. You're scared of the truth. You don't want that movie to show you just how bad the Jews are, and why everyone hates you.	['jews']
Kyle	6	1	People don't hate the Jews!	['jews']
Cartman	47	0	Really? Three hundred million domestic box-office, Kyle. The top-grossing film of all time, Kyle. Those numbers don't lie. If you're not scared of The Passion then go see it. Go see it and tell me I'm wrong. Mel Gibson, Kyle. Mel Gibson.	[]
Kyle	5	1	...You're a stupid asshole!	['asshole']
Cartman	15	0	Sweet, now I can just play with myself.  Pewpeww-pewww! Get back in the shuttlecraft!	[]
Kyle	2	0	One please.	[]
Ticket Salesman	6	0	This is an R-rated movie.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Yeah, I know, but I have to-	[]
Ticket Salesman	25	0	But, because this is such an important film that actually depicts the selfless act of Jesus Christ, I'll let you in to see it.	[]
Kyle	1	0	...Thanks.	[]
Soldier 1	3	0	Hac bashtud Christo.	[]
Soldier 2	5	0	Et lac Hesus. Belaca veshtad.	[]
Jesus	1	0	Wa!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Haaaah!	[]
Jesus	6	0	Non. Non. Nono, non, non, WAAAAHH!!	[]
Kyle	9	1	How? How could the Jews do that to Jesus?	['jews']
Ticket Salesman	13	0	Pretty brutal, isn't it? Kinda wanna make you change your life, huh?	[]
Announcer	7	0	And now, back to Terrance and Phillip.	[]
Phillip	7	0	Hey Terrance, I think I have a-	[]
Cartman	2	0	Mom! Doorbell!	[]
Terrance	7	0	Wait, before you do, pull my thumb.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Mom! Answer the door!	[]
Terrance	4	0	Hey Phillip, guess what?	[]
Cartman	6	3	God damn it, lazy-ass whore.	['damn', 'ass', 'whore']
Phillip	1	0	What?	[]
Terrance	1	0	Faaart.	[]
Kyle	30	2	You were right. You were right all along. I thought you were just an asshole when you ripped on Jews, but... I didn't know, I... I didn't know.	['asshole', 'jews']
Cartman	13	0	It's okay, Kyle. It's okay. Just... say that first part again?	[]
Kyle	5	0	You were, you were right?	[]
Cartman	5	0	Mmm, one more time, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	3	0	You were right.	[]
Cartman	103	0	I want to thank you for all the blessings you have brought me. You have shown me the way so many times in the past and... now you are making all my dreams come true. You give me strength when there is doubt, and I praise you for all you have done.  Only you, Mel Gibson, have had the wisdom and the courage to show the world the truth. From this day forward I will dedicate my life to making sure your film is seen by everyone. I will organize the masses so that we may do thy bidding. Hail Mel Gibson. Amen.	[]
Stan	17	0	Look at that, dude. The Passion has made almost 400 million dollars at the box office now.	[]
Kenny	1	1	(Goddamn.)	['goddamn']
Stan	18	0	Everyone in the country's gonna see that movie. I guess... we have to go see it too.	[]
Stan	4	0	Dude. That movie sucked.	[]
Kenny	4	0	(Yeah, it totally sucked!)	[]
Stan	8	0	How can they even call that a movie?	[]
Kenny	4	0	(I don't know!)	[]
Stan	11	1	That's bullcrap dude, let's go get our money back.	['bullcrap']
Kenny	1	0	(Yeah!)	[]
Jack	11	0	Wow, I didn't realize how horrible Christ's death was.	[]
Elise	12	0	Me neither. Oh honey, let's be good Christians from now on!	[]
Man 1	14	0	I think if more people saw The Passion they'd have faith in Jesus.	[]
Woman 1	8	0	Yeah, it really guilt-trips you into believing.	[]
Stan	6	0	Hey, we want our money back.	[]
Ticket Salesman	1	0	Huh?	[]
Stan	10	1	That movie sucked ass. Give us back our eighteen dollars.	['ass']
Ticket Salesman	12	0	I can't refund your money. You sat through the whole movie.	[]
Stan	10	0	That wasn't a movie, that was a snuff film!	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Yeah!)	[]
Stan	14	0	You can't charge people to watch a guy get tortured for two hours!	[]
Ticket Salesman	17	0	That guy happened to be Jesus, and he went through all that to pay for your sins!	[]
Stan	25	0	We go to church to learn that stuff! We go to movies to be entertained! We weren't entertained, and we want our money back!	[]
Ticket Salesman	30	0	I'm not allowed to give you your money back after you sat through the whole movie! You'd have to take your complaint up with the film's producers.	[]
Stan	17	0	W-what? Mel Gibson? You're saying we have to get our money back from Mel Gibson?	[]
Ticket Salesman	8	0	Yeah. I'd like to see you try.	[]
Stan	26	0	Oh, we will! This is America! And in America, if something sucks, you're supposed to be able to get your money back! Come on, Kenny!	[]
Priests	10	0	Kill him! Guilty! Kill him!  Kill him! Kill him! Die!	[]
Kyle	4	0	Kill Jesus! Yesss! Arrrgh!	[]
Stan	60	1	Okay, search for Mel Gibson. Mel Gibson bio, Mel Gibson news, Mel Gibson... home page. Here we go.  Welcome to Mel Gibson's ThePassion.com, your source for everything Mel. Pictures, philosophy, upcoming projects. Damn it, no phone number! Oh wait! For more information on Mel Gibson, call the Webmaster at 1-800-43.. Okay, okay, wait, here we go.	['damn']
Cartman	7	0	Mel Gibson's The Passion Fan Club.	[]
Stan	12	0	Hi, uh, my friend and I just went to see The Passion.	[]
Cartman	21	0	Uh huh, and so you want to join the fan club now. Our first meeting is at 5:30 p.m.	[]
Stan	9	0	No, no, no, no, we want our money back.	[]
Cartman	1	0	What?	[]
Stan	28	0	We think the movie sucked and we want Mel Gibson to give us back our eighteen dollars. Do you know how we can get in touch with him?	[]
Cartman	42	1	You thought it sucked? Sir, apparently, you don't understand what Mel Gibson was trying to do! He was trying to express, through cinema, the horror and filthiness of the common Jew. It has made people the world over open their eyes.	['jew']
Stan	28	0	Look, kid, we just thought it was a bad movie, so tell us how to get in touch with Mel Gibson so we can get our money back!	[]
Cartman	44	2	If I knew where Mel Gibson was, I'd be down on the floor licking his balls at this very moment, sir. All I know is he lives somewhere in Malibu. Now stop wasting me and Mel Gibson's time, you little wussy prick.	['balls', 'prick']
Stan	14	1	Hey, don't take that tone with me, kid! I'll kick your ass!	['ass']
Cartman	16	1	Oh yeah?! I'd like to see you try, asshole! I'm like six feet tall!	['asshole']
Stan	12	1	I don't care! You sound like a little bitch to me!	['bitch']
Cartman	13	3	Bitch?! Don't call me bitch! I'll pop your fuckin' head open!	['bitch', 'bitch', 'fuckin']
Stan	8	1	Yeah?! You wanna bring it, you little pussy?!	['pussy']
Cartman	18	2	I already brought it, bitch! I brought it, set it down on the table and opened it, bitch!	['bitch', 'bitch']
Stan	4	0	Wait a minute. Cartman?!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Eup.	[]
Stan	8	0	Come on, Kenny, we're going to Malibu!	[]
Kenny	3	0	(Malibu? But how?)	[]
Stan	38	0	We'll take the bus! Look, this isn't about the eighteen dollars ticket money anymore. This is about being able to hold bad filmmakers responsible!  This is just like when we got our money back for BASEketball!	[]
Liane	18	0	Eric, sweetie, there's a bunch of people showing up in our backyard saying something about a meeting?	[]
Cartman	20	0	Yeah Mom, I'm holding a meeting for all the people who loved The Passion as much as I did.	[]
Liane	5	0	Oh, that's great, sweetie.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Tell them I'll be down shortly	[]
Liane	2	0	Okay, hon.	[]
Cartman	27	0	Toten sie die Juden. Wir konnen nicht still stehen bis sie alle tot sind! Okay, I'm ready. I'm ready to do thy bidding, Mel Gibson.	[]
Man 1	8	0	Hello, are you folks holding this Passion meeting?	[]
Jack	17	0	No. Actually, we're guests as well. I'm Jack Garrett and this is my wife Elise.	[]
Elise	1	0	Hello.	[]
Man 2	17	0	I think it's so great that someone took the initiative to have a meeting like this.	[]
Elise	31	0	Oh I agree. There are so many of us who are moved by The Passion. It's a perfect idea to have us organize so we can strengthen the Christian community.	[]
Man 2	17	0	And apparently the organizer is just an eight year old boy who was touched by the film.	[]
Jack	12	0	Leave it to a child to show us all the way, huh?	[]
Ticket Salesman	24	0	Yeah, so I see this ad on the Internet saying if you love The Passion to come to this meeting, so here I am!	[]
Woman 2	20	0	It's great that everyone came here to figure out how to use The Passion to enrich everyone's lives.	[]
Cartman	60	0	Ah, hello everyone. Achtung.  My name is Eric Cartman and I'm the President of the Mel Gibson Fan Club.  Ah thank you, thank you. I'm happy to see that all of you.were affected by The Passion like I was. Now, we all know why we're here, and I believe we all what needs to be done.	[]
Woman 3	3	0	We sure do.	[]
Cartman	27	0	But, I think it's best we don't talk out loud about it until we have most of them on the trains heading to the camps.	[]
Elise	6	0	Wha- what does that mean, sweetie?	[]
Jack	47	0	I'm not sure, but- uh.  Folks, I just wanna interrupt for a second and say how remarkable it is that this little boy brought us all together. The Passion is causing a revolution of spirituality, and we owe Mel Gibson and this little boy our thanks.	[]
Cartman	45	0	Thank you, thank you very much. Now, in order to do what we  all know needs to be done, we are first going to need more support. I think we should all go out and take at least one other person to see The Passion.	[]
Man 3	16	0	Oh, what a great idea! We each make it our responsibility to convert one more person!	[]
Guests	5	0	Heheh, great! Yeah! Great idea.	[]
Cartman	14	0	Yes, and then we can begin the cleansing, if you know what I mean.	[]
Ticket Salesman	3	0	We sure do!	[]
Guests	4	0	Yeah. All right. Woohoo!	[]
Stan	13	1	Thank you.  This must be the place.  Goddamn, Mel Gibson must be loaded.	['goddamn']
Mel	1	0	Yes?	[]
Stan	11	0	Oh, hi, uh, my name is Stan, and this is Kenny.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Hello.)	[]
Stan	21	0	Uh, we saw your movie, The Passion, and we didn't like it, so, can we have our money back, please?	[]
Mel	18	0	You can't not like The Passion! I just followed the Bible! Christ died for you. Go home.	[]
Stan	17	0	Look, dude, we came a long way. We're not leaving until you give us our money.	[]
Mel	35	0	Oh yeah? Well you're gonna have to find it first.  But I won't tell you where I keep my money.  You can torture me all you want, I still won't tell you!	[]
Stan	3	0	Tor- torture you?	[]
Mel	32	0	Ha! So you do intend to torture me, huh?!  Well go ahead! Do your worst!  You still won't get your ticket money back! I can take whatever you can dish out!	[]
Stan	7	0	We don't want to torture you.	[]
Mel	31	0	I get it, but you don't have a choice, is that it?! Well go ahead! I just sure hope you don't use those whips over there on the wall!	[]
Stan	12	0	Dude, can we please just have the eighteen dollars back from you?	[]
Mel	52	0	I have to use that money to build my church! I brought the fire and brimstone back to Christianity with The Passion and now I'm gonna start my own church! And do you know why?! So I can play banjo!  Jesus, oh how I love ya, how I love ya Jesus!	[]
Stan	6	0	Dude, this guy is freakin' daffy!	[]
Mel	9	0	How dare you call me crazy! This means war!	[]
Father Maxi	18	0	And so it was that God sent his only son down from heaven, to die for our sins.	[]
Kyle	18	0	Oh okay, but did God sent Jesus TO die, or did Jesus just get kind of screwed over.	[]
Father Maxi	6	0	...What is troubling you, my child?	[]
Kyle	28	0	Well, I have this friend, see? And this friend belongs to a certain, Chosen People of Israel. And it... so happens that these chosen people killed your Lord.	[]
Father Maxi	7	1	Ah! You mean he's a Jew!	['jew']
Kyle	57	0	Right. But he can't live with the guilt anymore. Because, even if Jesus wasn't really the Son of God, he was still a nice guy. And he didn't deserve what happened to him in Mel Gibson's movie. I I can't sleep at night. I mean, my... friend can't sleep at night.	[]
Father Maxi	41	1	Yes, The Passion is very powerful. The truth is, there's not a whole lot in the Bible about the Crucifixion. The Passion was actually done as a performance piece back in the Middle Ages to incite people against the Jews.	['jews']
Kyle	8	1	But how can the Jews make it better??	['jews']
Father Maxi	23	0	Well, if you really care about your friend's soul, then perhaps show him the way of Jesus. Remember: Christianity is about atonement.	[]
Kyle	18	0	Wait. That's it. Atonement. Of course.  I know what I have to do now. Thank you, Father.	[]
Stan and Kenny	1	0	Aaaah!	[]
Mel	20	0	Two days ago, I saw a vehicle that would haul that tanker. You wanna get outta here? Talk to me.	[]
Stan	11	1	Mel Gibson is fucking crazy dude!  Wait! There's his wallet!	['fucking']
Mel	1	0	Freedom!	[]
Stan	12	1	Awww crap, he's only got twenties! You got two dollars, Kenny?	['crap']
Mel	3	0	Jesus is Lord! > />	[]
Stan	10	1	All right, let's get the hell out of here!	['hell']
Mel	9	0	When you're a clown, nobody takes you seriously!	[]
Stan	4	0	Aah! Run, dude, run!	[]
Mel	8	0	K'plagh! K'plagh! And good evening, frieeeeeeends!	[]
Cartman	63	0	One month ago today, this amazing film opened in theaters. And now, we proud few gather here as a people brought together by its message!  Fellow fans of Mel Gibson, our numbers have grown and now, together, we have the power to change the world!  Now I believe we should take to the streets and march in unwavering support of this important movie!	[]
Ticket Salesman	3	0	Woah! Great idea!	[]
Man 3	6	0	It'll be like a parade!	[]
Man 4	2	0	Good idea!	[]
Cartman	31	0	And as we march for The Passion we should also voice our support! So, when I say Es ist Zeit fur Sauberung, you all chant back Wir mussen die Juden ausrotten.	[]
Elise	6	0	Well, what does that mean, dear?	[]
Jack	12	0	Oh, I think it's Aramaic. You know, like in the movie.	[]
Ticket Salesman	3	0	Ooo, Aramaic. Cool.	[]
Townsfolk	6	0	Neato! That'll be awesome. Great!	[]
Jack	6	0	What was our Aramaic line again?	[]
Cartman	5	0	Wir mussen die Juden ausrotten!!	[]
Townsfolk	5	0	Wir mussen die Juden ausrotten.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Es ist Zeit fer Rache!	[]
Townsfolk	5	0	Wir mussen die Juden ausrotten.	[]
Elise	4	0	Oh, this is fun!	[]
Cartman	10	0	All right, everyone! Forward, march!  Es ist Zeit fur Rache!	[]
Townsfolk	5	0	Wir mussen die Juden ausrotten.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Es ist Zeit fur Rache!	[]
Townsfolk	5	0	Wir mussen die Juden ausrotten.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Nice.	[]
Rabbi	23	0	Shalom hak nak shalom. And now one of our fine young shlokas, Kyle Broflovski, has asked if he could speak to the congregation.	[]
Kyle	48	1	Thank you, rabbi.  In 1973, the United States officially issued an apology to the African American community for slavery. In 1956, Germany officially apologized for World War II AND the Holocaust. And now, I believe, in 2004, the Jewish community needs to apologize for the death of Jesus.	['jewish']
Man 4	1	0	What?	[]
Sheila	1	0	Whatwhatwhaaat?!	[]
Kyle	39	0	If we as a people choose not to believe that Jesus is the Son of God, then we can still apologize for the brutal way in which he was killed, and take our share of the responsibility for it.	[]
Man 5	3	0	Oh my God!	[]
Gerald	8	0	Kyle, what on earth has gotten into you?!	[]
Kyle	4	0	I saw The Passion!	[]
Man 6	4	0	Oh no! The Passion?!	[]
Man 7	10	0	This proves the anti-Semitic effect that movie is having!	[]
Man 8	6	1	Yeah, it makes Jews into stereotypes.	['jews']
Man 9	4	1	Stereotyping Jews is terrible.	['jews']
Woman 4	8	0	Something must be done to stop that movie!	[]
Rabbi	25	0	Now, now, everyone calm down. We live in a rational community, and everyone knows this is just a movie. There's no cause for alarm.	[]
Mob	5	0	Wir mussen die Juden ausrotten!	[]
Cartman	5	0	Es ist Zeit fur Rache!	[]
Mob	5	0	Wir mussen die Juden ausrotten!	[]
Cartman	5	0	Es ist Zeit fur Rache!	[]
Mob	5	0	Wir mussen die Juden ausrotten!	[]
Cartman	5	0	Es ist Zeit fur Rache!	[]
Stan	33	0	Well it looks like with these bus tickets we spend about eighty... seven dollars getting our money back from Mel Gibson.  But I think it's the principle of the thing that matters.	[]
Kenny	3	0	(Yeah. I agree.)	[]
Stan	8	1	Oh, you've got to be shittin' me.	['shittin']
Mel	5	0	Give me back my money!	[]
Stan	12	1	Goddamn, that guy's crazy.  Hey dude, you've gotta speed up.	['goddamn']
Driver	1	0	Huh?	[]
Stan	11	0	Mel Gibson is chasing after us. You've gotta go faster.	[]
Driver	10	0	Haha, very funny, kid. Sit down and stop playing games.	[]
Stan	15	0	I'm not playing games. Mel Gibson is right behind you and he's gonna-	[]
Driver	3	1	What the hell?	['hell']
Mel	3	0	Haaaa! K'Plaaaa!	[]
Driver	5	0	Hey! That's Mel Gibson!	[]
Stan	5	0	Yeah. I told you that!	[]
Driver	7	1	Well, what the hell does he want?!	['hell']
Stan	16	0	He wouldn't give us our money back for The Passion, so we kinda took it.	[]
Driver	21	0	You didn't like The Passion? But it shows how Christ suffered for you. Mel Gibson is a very spiritual man.	[]
Kyle	13	0	Both you guys, stop! Please. You're gonna make people hate us more!	[]
Ticket Salesman	4	0	Can I help you?	[]
Rabbi	13	0	This movie is causing anti-Semitism! You must remove it from your theater!	[]
Congregants	7	0	That's right! Yeah! Remove your movie!	[]
Shlomo	7	1	Remove it from the theater? Fat chance!	['fat']
Man 10	6	0	We demand you stop showing it!	[]
Congregants	2	0	Yeah! Yeah!	[]
Kyle	18	0	No, no, no! Don't become an angry mob!  The last time we did that we killed Jesus!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Juden!	[]
Jack	5	0	What's going on here?	[]
Ticket Salesman	11	0	They're trying to have The Passion pulled from the theater.	[]
Rabbi	10	0	This film is anti-Semitic and it must be stopped!	[]
Man 11	16	0	Nonsense! Mel Gibson is a smart and spiritual man! There's nothing anti-Semitic about it!	[]
Elise	9	0	It has reaffirmed all of our faith in Christ.	[]
Rabbi	17	1	It's made one of our little Jewish boys want to apologize for the death of Jesus!	['jewish']
Jack	5	0	Well, maybe you should apologize.	[]
Mob	6	0	That's right! What he said.	[]
Woman 5	3	0	How dare you?!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Look out!!	[]
Mel	5	0	Give me my eighteen dollars!	[]
Cartman	33	0	Mel! Gibson!  Oh mein Savior! Mein Fuhrer! You're actually here! Mr. Gibson, I have assembled the masses! We are ready to do thy bidding!  Have I been a good boy, Mr. Gibson?!	[]
Mel	34	0	Ha!  So! You boys have led me here to your secret base, huh? I guess now you're gonna start torturing me! Well!  Oh, my nipples are so tender! Don't squeeze them anymore!	[]
Ticket Salesman	4	0	That's... Mel Gibson?	[]
Jack	11	0	H- he's not... quite as eloquent as I had pictured.	[]
Mel	12	0	Yeah...  I'll bet you wanna torture me now, don't you?!	[]
Kyle	6	0	Dude, what's wrong with him?	[]
Stan	12	0	He's koo-koo, dude. He's absolutely out of his mind.	[]
Mel	24	0	You! You would all love to torture me, wouldn't you?  Okay, fine. See what you can fit in there, I can take it!	[]
Kyle	15	0	Dude! I've been freaked out this whole time because of that guy's movie?	[]
Mel	17	0	Fine! If nobody here is man enough to torture me, then just give me my eighteen dollars!	[]
Stan	8	0	It's our eighteen dollars! Your movie sucked!	[]
Mel	14	0	You can't say my movie sucked, or else you're saying Christianity sucked!	[]
Stan	45	0	No, dude, if you wanna be Christian, that's cool, but, you should follow what Jesus taught instead of how he got killed. Focusing on how he got killed is what people did in the Dark Ages and it ends up with really bad results.	[]
Jack	19	0	You know, he's right, Elise. We shouldn't focus our faith on the torture and execution of Christ.	[]
Ticket Salesman	18	0	Yeah. Lots of people got crucified in those times. We shouldn't rely on violence to inspire faith.	[]
Cartman	15	0	Aw, aw, no, come on, people, we're so close to completing my final solution!	[]
Kyle	23	2	Oh, dude, I feel so much better about being Jewish now that I see that Mel Gibson is just a big wacko douche.	['jewish', 'douche']
Mel	2	0	Woohoohoo! Woohoohoohoohoo!	[]
