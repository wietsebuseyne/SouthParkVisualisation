"A singer, Goth Kids (singing)"	11	0	(South Park Theme#Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers Lyrics)	[]
Henrietta	28	0	So I cast my body into the trails of blood. The knife pierces deep, deep into my lonely eyes. So I can see this black world... no more.	[]
Pete	6	0	Whoa... That's pretty hardcore._	[]
Michael	7	0	That's real pain right there._	[]
Henrietta	22	0	That's how I feel, when my mother abuses me. I just wanna escape, to she can't hurt me anymore._	[]
Mrs. Biggle	2	0	Henrietta, sweetie.	[]
Henrietta	5	0	Shut up, Mom! Go away!	[]
Mrs. Biggle	17	0	Oh, but remember, Daddy wanted to talk to you in the living room, my dark little princess.	[]
Henrietta	15	0	Stop calling me a princess! I'm not a beauty queen in a Disney movie!	[]
Mrs. Biggle	8	0	We'll be waiting in the living room.	[]
Henrietta	4	0	God, she just_never stops!	[]
Mrs. Biggle	7	0	Oh goodness I am so nervous._	[]
Henrietta	1	0	What?!	[]
Mr. Biggle	5	0	Have a seat, Henrietta._	[]
Mrs. Biggle	6	0	Oh, a little family chit-chaaat.	[]
Henrietta	3	0	Shut up, Mom!	[]
Mr. Biggle	17	0	Henrietta, as you know, your mother and I have been concerned about your behavior for some time.	[]
Henrietta	6	0	Are we really doing this again?!	[]
Mr. Biggle	36	0	We've had a hard time coping with the dark things you're into, but we've finally had some counseling, and apparently we're not the only parents who have a child that is... emo.	[]
Henrietta	1	0	What?!	[]
Mrs. Biggle	13	0	But Daddy and I_love_our little muffin, even if she's emo or not.	[]
Henrietta	14	2	I'm not a fucking emo! Don't you even know the fucking diff!	['fucking', 'fucking']
Mr. Biggle	12	0	Do you know how your foul language breaks your mother's heart?	[]
Mrs. Biggle	5	1	Like calling Mommy Demon Jizz.	['jizz']
Mr. Biggle	9	0	So listen, sweetie, we've found a camp._	[]
Henrietta	1	0	Noo...	[]
Mr. Biggle	19	0	A camp which is for troubled kids like you, and you get to work outside and learn about responsibility.	[]
Henrietta	8	1	I'm not going to any fucking camp!	['fucking']
Mr. Biggle	20	0	It's for two weeks, and when you come back we can talk about earning back some of your privileges.	[]
Henrietta	42	2	I won't come back because I'll be fucking dead. I'll walk out of that camp and I'll walk the streets until I probably get picked up and gangbanged by criminals until I'm bleeding out my fucking eyes!!	['fucking', 'fucking']
Mrs. Biggle	14	0	Theeeey have a horseshoe pit where you can challenge the other kids to horsehoooes.	[]
Pete	11	0	And that's all you know? what else did she say?	[]
Michael	20	0	She said that her parents called her an emo and she had to go to this camp for two weeks.	[]
Pete	6	0	Oh my God, for two weeks?	[]
Firkle	6	0	Is she at the camp now?	[]
Michael	39	0	I don't know.__She texted from the bus they put her on, then she said she wasn't even allowed to have her cell phone where she was going. Then all of a sudden her texts went dark.	[]
Pete	1	0	Whoa...	[]
Firkle	5	1	That's fucking creepy man.	['fucking']
Michael	17	0	I just can't believe it. I can't believe parents would do that to their child.	[]
Worker	14	0	Alright now, you say that you witnessed your friend being abused by her parents.	[]
Michael	6	0	Yes. They called her an emo.	[]
Worker	5	0	What's wrong with that?	[]
Michael	8	1	Emos suck! Their vile, self-pitying, depressed assholes!	['assholes']
Worker	9	0	So, why do you think they called her that?	[]
Michael	13	0	Because she's Goth, and some ignorant people don't know the difference!	[]
Worker	2	0	What_is_the difference?	[]
Pete	7	0	Oh my God! They're totally different!	[]
Worker	3	0	Okay, different how?	[]
Pete	20	0	They're achm, you know, one is good and an' emos are horrible!__You're, you know... They're posers!	[]
Firkle	5	1	Emos suck my Goth balls.	['balls']
Michael	28	2	Alright alright, think of it this way: a goth believes that deep down the world is totally fucked up. But an_emo_thinks that deep down,_they_are totally fucked up.	['fucked', 'fucked']
Worker	7	0	That's not much of a difference.	[]
Pete	6	1	That's a huge fucking difference!	['fucking']
Michael	9	0	Okay okay, look, emos are more prone to suicide.	[]
Pete	4	2	This fuckin' bitch, man.	['fuckin', 'bitch']
Michael	12	0	But goths are more prone to be depressed that so many people_commit_suicide	[]
Pete	10	0	Goth's darkness is nihilistic whereas Emo's is cynical.	[]
Michael	11	0	Wait, I thought_we_were cynical. ...What what whatever, it doesn't matter.	[]
Pete	5	0	No, see, you're nihilistic.	[]
Michael	5	0	Oh yeah, you're right.	[]
Henrietta	39	2	Hel-lo?! Somebody let me out of here! You can't treat people like this!__This is fucking ridiculous! What's wrong with you?! I'm gonna go to the fucking cops when I get out of here!_	['fucking', 'fucking']
Pete	12	0	What if she comes back, and she's all preppy and conformist?	[]
Michael	19	0	She's only been there two weeks. They can't have changed her that much. Can they have?_	[]
Firkle	4	0	Oh. My. God._	[]
Henrietta	3	0	Hey guys._	[]
Pete	8	1	What the hell have they done to you?	['hell']
Henrietta	21	0	What do you mean? They couldn't do anything. They can't fix me. They don't even understand me._	[]
Michael	12	0	Oh my God it's worse than we thought! They made her_emo!	[]
Michael	11	0	Has she said one word to either one of you guys?	[]
Pete	11	0	Nothing. It's like she's a totally different person._	[]
Michael	20	1	She won't even look at us. All she does now is hang out with the douchebag emo kids._	['douchebag']
Emo Boy	8	0	God, PE class is for such wannabe posers.	[]
Emo Girl	10	0	I'd rather kill myself than put on gym shorts.	[]
Henrietta	12	0	I wish there would just be an earthquake, so we could all_die.	[]
Pete	8	0	Uugh, how could she hang out with them??	[]
Michael	7	0	There must something else going on here.	[]
Henrietta	6	0	Not now Mom! I'm suicidal!	[]
Michael	8	0	It's not your mom, it's me.	[]
Henrietta	3	0	Oh, hey._	[]
Michael	9	0	What did they do you you? At that camp?	[]
Henrietta	10	1	What do you mean? Just the usual group therapy crap.	['crap']
Michael	17	0	Don't take this the wrong way, but I think that place turned you into an emo.	[]
Henrietta	18	0	That's ridiculous. I'm not anything. I don't fit in anywhere. I'm not emo, okay?	[]
Michael	50	0	Then why are you listening to Sunny Day Real Estate?__I was thinking, maybe they just made you confused at that place. Maybe they didn't know what they were doing. But then I started thinking, maybe that place... turned you emo on purpose. Like maybe they_knew_what they were doing.	[]
Henrietta	7	0	You should probably stop digging for answers.	[]
Michael	1	0	What?!	[]
Henrietta	18	0	There's no winning this for you.__Soon the entire world will be emo. It is our time.	[]
Michael	2	0	Nooo waaaaay.	[]
Henrietta	14	0	Nobody understands us. And they won't understand until it is faaar tooo late.	[]
Michael	1	0	Omigodnowaaaaaaaaay.	[]
Henrietta	17	0	Do not fight it, Michael. Is being emo really all that different from being goth?__Join us!	[]
Michael	6	0	No waaay!__No way no waaaaaay!	[]
A ring tone	12	0	Death and despair! Death and despair! Death and despair! Death and desp-	[]
Pete	1	0	Hello?	[]
Michael	6	0	It's worse thann we thought.	[]
Pete	4	0	What is? Everything?_	[]
Michael	46	0	No! I mean Henrietta. I confronted her and she was all like I am emo! And emos are going to rule the world and I was like No waaay! and she was like Yeah, soon it will be too late. and I was all No waaay!	[]
Pete	2	0	No way.	[]
Michael	25	0	Yeah, so listen: call up Firkle and meet me at Village Inn. I gotta run home, but I'll be there in ten minutes._	[]
Mom	3	0	Michael! Michael!_	[]
Michael	9	0	Can't now, Mom! I've got an emergency!	[]
Dad	28	0	In the dining room Michael! Let's go!__Have a seat, son.__Your mom and I have decided you're going to go away for a little while.	[]
Michael	1	0	What??	[]
Dad	15	0	We've been put in touch with this camp for troubled kids like you and-	[]
Michael	7	1	What the hell are you talking about?!	['hell']
Mom	10	0	This place gonna fix you, make you normal child!_	[]
Michael	21	1	No! You've gotta listen to me! You don't know what you're doing!!__You fucking conformists!__They're evillll!	['fucking']
Pete	20	0	I never thought it would end like this. I never thought that Goths would just be slowly replaced by Emos.	[]
Firkle	25	0	Pete... if they get me... if I get sent to that camp... and I come back Emo... kill me. Promise that you'll kill me.	[]
Pete	2	0	I promise.	[]
Waitress	13	0	Hey, you kids need to order somethin' or you need to go!_	[]
Pete	7	0	Not now, lady, we're really depressed.	[]
Waitress	5	0	So what else is new?	[]
Pete	34	0	This is different, okay?! Our two friends are being bodysnatched by Emos!__There's only one other group who understands Emos like we do. We're gonna have to team up with the Vampires.	[]
Firkle	3	0	Are you crazy?	[]
Pete	5	0	What choice do we have?!	[]
Firkle	20	0	The Vampires are our sworn enemy. We beat up their leader, and burned down their lair. Don't you remember?	[]
Pete	27	0	Yeah I remember. And it may be a suicide mission, but we have to walk right in the middle of the Vampires, and ask them for help.	[]
Vampir	26	0	Okay, let's all be seated please?__This is thee noon meeting of the Vamp kids? I am Mike, your lord and dark master, per se.	[]
Vamps	2	0	Hail Mike.	[]
Mike	23	0	Okay uhhh, our main order of business is of course the Halloween social. We're still looking for volunteers to make the-_	[]
Mohawk Vamp	6	0	It's the Goth kids!_	[]
Pete	41	1	Ugh. You spit on me, Larry.__Uhh, hey everybody, uuhm, I know we aren't on the greatest terms right now. We realize we called you all queermos, aaand we're sorry we burned down the Hot Topic at the mall.	['queermos']
Firkle	1	0	Sorry.	[]
Pete	15	0	But uhhh we have a bigger problem here, and it's ALL of our problem.	[]
Mike	9	0	You've got a lot of nerve coming here!	[]
Pete	55	0	Now, shut up Mike. Listen, okay? There's a camp that kids like us are being sent to, a-and somehow this place is taking kids like us and... turning them Emo.__Yeah. You might not even be able to tell at first. It could have already happened. One of you might already be turned.	[]
Black Vamp	19	0	Okay hold up! Hold up! You mean that one of us might not really be a Vamp kid?_	[]
Pete	2	0	Uhhhhh, right.	[]
Black Vamp	30	4	Well whoever you is, you better get yo' ass ready to run, muthafucka, 'cause you're a damn traitor! And I bet you it's this little nigga right here!	['ass', 'muthafucka', 'damn', 'nigga']
Henrietta	10	0	Are you guys getting into that Fall Out Boy concert?	[]
Emo Girl	11	0	I can't. I'm too depressed. I keep cutting myself.	[]
Henrietta	15	0	Yeah. I'm cutting myself to hurt this worthless body that I'm in._	[]
Mrs. Biggle	10	0	Henrietta, I baked cookies for your new little Emo friends.	[]
Henrietta	29	0	Not now, Mom! Can't you see I'm hurting?!__I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment! Sorry I'm not the pretty cheerleader ya always wanted!_	[]
Mr. Biggle	5	0	Does she still seem better?	[]
Mrs. Biggle	16	1	Oh, much better! She didn't call me a bitch, and she actually apologized to me.	['bitch']
Mr. Biggle	6	0	Well that's more like it.	[]
Emo Boy 1	33	0	You know what we should do? After us Emos take over the Earth? We should um, paint the White House black. And we should have Fall Out Boy at the Super Bowl._	[]
Emo Boy 2	14	0	We're Emos.__When we rule the Earth we're not gonna have football.	[]
Emo Boy 1	3	0	Oh yeah._	[]
Mike	9	0	And you say she just showed up like this?	[]
Pete	10	0	You know Henrietta; that thing in there is not Henrietta!	[]
Cowlick Vamp	14	0	That blonde Emo is Sarah Collins. She was a Vamp kid two weeks ago.	[]
Black Vamp	15	1	You want me to go in there and waste these mothafuckas?! I'll do it!	['mothafuckas']
Pete	20	1	We can't just go in there and kick their asses. We have to stop this thing at its source.	['asses']
Mike	28	0	Indeed. If there is some kind of black magic at work creating these monsters, then we will have to use our most powerful Vampiric abilities to stop it.	[]
Cowlick Vamp	3	0	Do you mean?	[]
Mike	34	0	Yes, my child of darkness. We must call upon the powers of the Vamp kids' most sacred entity, per se. Only he can help us in this darkest time. This calls... for a summoning.	[]
Mike	53	0	We call upon the creator of all that is dark! The godfather of Death and Despair! Edgar Allan Poe, your followers in darkness beg for your help!__We summon to the world of the living the great Edgar Allan Poe! Knower of all that is misery! Your children need special guidance! Per se.	[]
Pete	14	0	This, is your plan?! Try to summon Edgar Allan Poe back from the dead?!	[]
Mike	8	0	Edgar Allan Poe was the original Vamp kid.	[]
Pete	14	0	No, he was the original Goth, but he'd been dead for 150 years!	[]
Black Vamp	15	1	Ey, look man! All genres of Gothic subcultures are derivatives of Poe's work. Muthafucka!	['muthafucka']
Pete	19	0	Look, we came to you for help, and all you've done since then is waste our time!_	[]
Cowlick Vamp	4	1	Holy shit look!_	['shit']
Poe	7	0	Where am I? What is this place?	[]
Firkle	8	0	It's him! It's Edgar Allan Poe.	[]
Poe	10	0	Why have the living summoned me from my rest?_	[]
Pete	26	0	Uhhhhh okayokay, listen: there's this camp for troubled kids, right? Only they aren't helping kids, they're, they're purposefully turning them into Emos.	[]
Poe	10	0	Emos? ...Ew-oh my God, Emos are such wannabe conformists.	[]
Mike	3	0	Yeah, oh yes!	[]
Pete	1	0	Right!	[]
Poe	27	2	Children of Darkness, I would help you, but I fear I cannot be seen with a bunch of douchey Vamp kids and their poser-ass plastic fangs.	['douchey', 'ass']
Pete	2	0	Thank you!	[]
Mike	1	0	Hey!	[]
Pete	16	0	I'm just saying it's nice to know that Edgar Allan Poe agrees wth us.	[]
Poe	22	1	Agrees with who? Is that red dye in your hair or did a blood demon take a shit on your head, poser?	['shit']
Black Vamp	7	1	Ah ah! He got you there, nigga!	['nigga']
Pete	16	0	Okay, look, we're running out of time. You have to help us stop the Emos.	[]
Poe	17	0	Why should I? Just 'cause you summoned me doesn't mean you're the boss of me!	[]
Pete	6	0	Uh, yeah, it kind of does.	[]
Poe	10	0	Oh okay, Mom. Let's go fight the Emos, Mom.	[]
Michael	21	1	What? Where are you tay- No! NO!!__What the hell?? ...Oh my God.__Get me out of here! Let me go!	['hell']
Gardener	10	0	Shhhhh.__It's best you don't upset them._	[]
Michael	8	1	What the hell are you doing to people?!	['hell']
Gardener	52	0	Not me. I just work for them. They're not evil, you know? They're just misunderstood. All I do is help the Emos get into their human hosts. They promised me when they take over Earth I can have a cabin on the lake, and all the steak I can eat.	[]
Michael	7	0	Wait a minute. Emos are plants?_	[]
Gardener	39	0	Shhh, shhh, it's okay. Not just any plants. They're very unique. Very special. Nobody undertands them. Emoclarus americanus. Wonderful species._Except for their tendencies of self-mutilation and the need for other species to acknowledge their pain.	[]
Michael	7	0	Oh, it all makes sense now!_	[]
Gardener	27	0	Oh! I'm sorry. Sorry, Emo King.__Oh no, I wasn't talking to him. I mean, I was, but- Y-yes! Yes, I understand.__Right away.	[]
Michael	11	0	No.__What are you doing?! I don't wanna be emo!	[]
Gardener	10	0	You just don't understand. You'll understand them soon.	[]
Michael	3	0	What the...?_	[]
Gardener	9	0	It's quicker if you don't fight it.	[]
Michael	3	0	No, NOOOOOOOOO!_	[]
Pete	17	0	Alright, listen up. Once we find our friend, we've gotta torch the place and get out.	[]
Firkle	9	0	Dude, Edgar, can you not smoke in the car?	[]
Poe	15	0	You can't tell me what to do! Who elected you the mayor of me?!	[]
Pete	8	0	Cut it out, Edgar! It's annoying everybody!	[]
Poe	20	1	God, you guys are so lame!__And if you want my help, you'd better all stop calling me Edgar.	['lame']
Black Vamp	7	0	Well that's_your name, isn't it?	[]
Poe	19	0	That's the name my stupid parents gave me! I like to be called by my Goth name: NightPain	[]
"Black Vamp, Mike, and Pete"	2	0	Oh God...	[]
Poe	5	0	What? You guys are posers!	[]
Black Vamp	43	2	Ey, just so you all know, if one of you ain't who you say they is, and we get inside that base and you reveal you're actually one of them Emo muthafuckas in disguise, I WILL go crazy on yo' ass!	['muthafuckas', 'ass']
Poe	14	0	If one of us is a traitor, it's probably your wannabe vampire leader.	[]
Mike	4	1	Oh, fuck off, NightPain.	['fuck']
Poe	3	0	Make me, poser.	[]
Pete	3	0	Michael?! You here?	[]
Mike	8	0	I feel like we're being watched._	[]
Pete	5	0	Dude! Michael, are you okay?	[]
Michael	22	0	Kick it over! Stop the plant!__Oh! Oh, thank God you're here. Emos are plants and they're invading human bodies.	[]
Pete	20	0	Alright, we're gonna get you out of here, and then we're gonna burn this whole place down._	[]
Firkle	12	0	I'm sorry, but I'm afraid that's not the plan.	[]
Gardener	13	0	You did very good. The emo plants are very pleased with your dedication.	[]
Michael	16	0	Firkle! All this time I thought you were Goth! How long have you been Emo?_	[]
Firkle	16	0	Don't you see we can't stop them? We might as well join' em._	[]
Gardener	15	0	Yes Emo King, right away.__The Emo King wants us to proceed at once._	[]
Pete	7	0	Ugh! Let us go, you ultimate conformists!	[]
Gardener	10	0	Don't fight it. It's quicker that way._	[]
Mike	8	0	Oh God! I'm starting to feel Emo.	[]
Pete	10	1	Wait a minute. Where the hell is Edgar Allan Poe?	['hell']
Mike	15	0	He said he was over this, and was gonna hang out at the Village Inn.	[]
Pete	1	0	What?!	[]
Waitress	19	0	Hey, are you gonna order any food, or are you just gonna sit there and drink coffee all day?	[]
Poe	7	0	Leave me alone! I just want coffeh.	[]
Waitress	2	1	Little prick.	['prick']
Poe	1	1	Bitch.	['bitch']
Pete	20	1	Poe? Edgar Allan Poe, where are you?__What the hell are you doing?! Yo're supposed to be helping us!	['hell']
Poe	19	0	I can't right now. I'm dealing with a lot and I just have a lot of anxiety.	[]
Pete	9	0	Look, we__summoned you to help us save the world!	[]
Poe	26	2	What's the point? Save some people so some other people can be lame? And then those lame-os can be lamer to some other posers?	['lame', 'lame']
Pete	7	0	God, he is such a downer!_	[]
Gardener	9	0	Just let the spores inside you. Stop fighting it.	[]
Mike	2	0	Wait. Look!	[]
Poe	5	0	Okay, I'm here, posers.	[]
Pete	10	0	NightPain! Destroy the plant leader! The leader over there!_	[]
Poe	7	0	What do you want me to do?	[]
"Mike, Michael, and Pete"	2	0	Shoot it!	[]
Poe	4	0	Really? Shoot a plant?	[]
Michael	3	0	Shoot it!_	[]
Poe	21	0	Wait a minute. What is this?__This says it was bought at Lowe's Home and Garden for $29.95._	[]
Gardener	5	0	Lowe's Home and Garden?	[]
Pete	3	0	Hey, these_are_just plants.	[]
Gardener	6	0	No they, they talk to me.	[]
Poe	10	0	No, they're just, like, ficus plants and vibrating pots.	[]
Gardener	1	0	But-	[]
Voice	18	0	Looks like it's over, Harold Flannagan. So we have just one question for you: are you scared?!	[]
Flannagan	4	0	What do you mean?	[]
Voice	3	0	ARE YOU SCARED?!	[]
Flannagan	2	0	YES!!!_	[]
Voice	12	0	That's good! 'Cause you're on... Yes, I Was Scared!_	[]
Pete	2	0	What??_	[]
Host	7	0	Look! Look at the camera right there	[]
Flannagan	7	0	Oh my God, are you serious?_	[]
Host	8	0	Your wife Sarah put you up to this.	[]
Sarah	5	0	Haha I got you!_	[]
Firkle	4	0	This is a prank?	[]
Black Vamp	9	0	Oh man that's good! They got us good!	[]
Firkle	7	0	I turned traitor for no good reason?	[]
Pete	5	0	Did you know about this?	[]
Michael	8	0	I have no idea what's going on.	[]
Host	19	0	Howard, did you suspect at all that a gardener job at a camp for troubled teens was a setup?	[]
Flannagan	6	0	No, they really had me convinced!	[]
Host	28	0	And you didn't suspect anything when we had plants tell you to turn Goths and Vamp kids into Emos when really they're exactly the same thing?	[]
Flannagan	13	0	I guess I should have figured it out. I'm an idiot._	[]
Host	21	0	Tune in again next week, when we make a woman from Milwaukee think she's working at a haunted abortion clinic.	[]
Henrietta	8	0	So, my friends. Have you made the transformation?	[]
Pete	29	0	Uhhhh, Henrietta, we have some bad news. The plants you think took over your body and made you emo? They're just plants.__From Lowe's Home and Garden.	[]
Michael	11	1	It was all a prank by some douchey network reality show.	['douchey']
Henrietta	16	0	Nnnnoooo, there's an organic spore in my head that made me switch cliques so easily.	[]
Michael	10	0	No, you just kind of did it on your own.	[]
Henrietta	8	0	Oh my Gawd.__This is so... em-barrassing.	[]
Pete	20	0	Ahh, hang on. What I meant to say was__we just infiltrated the Emo lair and... we torched the plant leader.	[]
Henrietta	24	0	Oh.__Oh!__Ihihit's meee-e! I'm, I'm I'm me again!__Oh my God I'm... all better. Thanks you guys.	[]
Mrs. Biggle	5	0	Henrietta, I have dinner ready.	[]
