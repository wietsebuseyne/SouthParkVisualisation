Stan	6	0	What are these? They're Chinpokomon!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Huh?	[]
Cartman	8	0	You don't appear to have any Chinpokomon.	[]
Kyle	11	0	No, but look: I just got this sweet Cyborg Bill doll.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Oh, please. Cyborg Bill is so yesterday.	[]
Stan	4	0	Yeah, like ancient history.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Cyborg Bill isn't cool anymore?	[]
Stan	2	0	No, dude!	[]
Cartman	11	0	Cyborg Bill hasn't been cool for a long time, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	10	1	Why the hell don't people tell me these things?!	['hell']
Cartman	5	0	It's all Chinpokomon now.	[]
Stan	12	0	Dude, if you collect Chinpokomon you can complete the Primary Main Objective.	[]

Sheila	4	0	What's a Chinpokomon?	[]
Kyle	4	0	I'm not sure.	[]
Sheila	6	0	Well, why do you need one?	[]
Kyle	4	0	I don't know.	[]
Sheila	17	0	...Well then, the answer is no, Kyle. You just got money to buy your Cyborg Bill doll.	[]
Kyle	14	1	Yeah, but Cyborg Bill is totally gay now. Please Mom? Everybody else has Chinpokomon.	['gay']
Gerald	10	0	Well, Kyle, that's not a reason to buy something.	[]
Ike	3	0	Neah Kyle doh.	[]
Gerald	63	0	You see, son, fads come and go. And this Chin-po-ko-mon is obviously nothing more than a fad. You don't have to be a part of it. In fact, you can make an even stronger statement by saying to your peers, I'm not going to be a part of this fad, because I'm an individual. Do you understand?	[]
Kyle	54	1	Yes. Yes, I do, Dad. Now let me tell you how it works in the real world. In the real world, I can either get a Chinpokomon, or I can be the only kid without one, which singles me out, and causes the other kids to make fun of me and kick my ass.	['ass']
Gerald	6	0	Hm... Good point; here's $10.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Thanks.	[]
Gerald	10	0	Wait, here's 20. Get one for your brother, too.	[]
Ike	4	0	Hey, Chih-paw-ko.	[]
Cashier	15	0	There you go, son. I honestly don't know what you see in these things.	[]

Cashier	7	1	What the hell is goin' on here?	['hell']
Kyle	9	0	Hey you guys! Check out my sweet Chinpokomon doll!	[]

Sharon	10	0	I'm watching one of Stanley's Chinpokomon video tapes.	[]
Randy	1	0	Why?	[]
Sharon	26	0	Our son loves this show, Randy, so I think it's important that we watch it to see if it's teaching him good moral values.	[]
Roostor	3	0	Roo-oo-oostor!	[]
Randy	5	0	...Are those good moral values?	[]
Sharon	11	1	I don't know what the hell they're talking about.	['hell']
Narrator	17	0	But Lambtron's powers also give him a good chance for a new fight. Will he succeed?	[]
Sharon	17	0	This doesn't make sense. Are those stupid things supposed to be animals or robots or what?	[]
Randy	12	0	I don't know, but I suddenly kinda wanna own them all.	[]
Sharon	11	0	Randy, we can't allow our son to watch this stuff!	[]
Randy	10	0	Well, it's not like it's vulgar or violent.	[]
Sharon	33	0	No, but it's incredibly stupid, and that could be worse on a child's mind than any vulgarity or violence. Remember what Battle of the Network Stars did to an entire generation.	[]
Randy	5	0	My God, you're right.	[]
Cartman	29	0	Come on, brothers and sistersWe've all got to join togetherJoin together and give me moneySo I can buy more Chinpokomon!We've got to stop this fight and...	[]

Cartman	28	3	Ey! I'm the one who's been standing out here with this gay guitar like a God-damned hippie all weekend! What have you two assholes done?!	['gay', 'damned', 'assholes']
Stan	14	0	We can't do anything. Kenny still hasn't come out of his seizure.	[]
Kyle	9	0	I got it! I got my Chinpokomon game controller!	[]
Cartman	9	0	Jesus tap dancing Christ! Get with the program, Kyle!	[]
Stan	18	0	Yeah. Nobody plays the Chinpokomon video games anymore. Now it's all about the big weekend Chinpokomon camp.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Camp?	[]
Cartman	27	0	The makers of Chinpokomon are going town to town and putting on a special camp to show all the Chinpoko Masters how to destroy the Evil Power.	[]
Stan	5	0	You didn't know that?	[]
Kyle	42	0	No, uh-I knew it! I knew it. I was just testing you guys. You just wait till I get to that Chinpokomon camp! I'm gonna be the toughest master of them all! So we'll see you there, a-ight?	[]

Sharon	20	0	We just thought we'd bring it to everyone's attention because, honestly, we don't know how to feel.	[]
Liane	23	0	Well, I'm letting Eric go to the camp. I mean, it seems to me this Chinpokomon thing is just another harmless fad.	[]
Sheila	16	0	Yeah. We told Kyle he could go if he did all his chores, and he did.	[]
Randy	13	0	Now, I'm not sure this blatant commercialism is good for our boys.	[]
Sheila	23	0	Well, you know how it is, Randy. The more we forbid them to play with Chinpokomons, the more they're gonna love them.	[]
Sharon	23	0	You're right, Sheila. I guess the best thing we can do is just let them go until they get sick of it.	[]
Sheila	19	0	Sure. Apparently, they've been doing these camps in every city around the country; how bad can they be?	[]
Cartman	6	0	Get outta the way! Move it!	[]

Reporter	13	0	And now, for a special announcement from the President of the United States.	[]
President Clinton	110	3	My fellow Americans, I wish to address the concerns many of us have over the growing number of Japanese military bases forming in the United States. The new Japanese emperor, Hirohito, has made our own children into fighter pilots who will soon fly to Hawaii and attack Pearl Harbor. I spoke with Mr. Hirohito this morning, and he assured me that I have a very large penis. He said it was mammoth, dinosauric, and absolutely dwarfed his penis, which, he assured me, was nearly microscopic in size. My penis, he said, was most likely one of the biggest on the planet. I applaud Mr. Hirohito in his honesty. Thank you.	['penis', 'penis', 'penis']

Stan	4	0	No.  Screw this, dude.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Where are you going, Stan?	[]
Stan	22	0	Huh, I don't know. Chinpokomon just doesn't seem that cool anymore. I'm gonna go kill some ants or something.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Wait for me, I wanna get out of these stupid clothes.	[]
Other kids	5	0	Yeah. Me too! Me too.	[]
President Hirohito	1	0	Nooo!!	[]
Randy	20	0	Well, you were right, Sharon. The best way to make our kids not like something is to like it ourselves.	[]
Sharon	43	1	That's right. Anything we like is instantly not cool.  We know how to take them out, Mr. Garrison. Spread the word! Get on the wire to every parent around the country and tell them how to bring those sons of bitches down!	['bitches']

Kyle	10	0	Dude, you're just jealous because I'm Chinpoko Master!	[]
Stan	34	0	No, Kyle. You see, we learned something today. This whole Chinpokomon thing happened because we all followed the group. We only liked Chinpokomon because everyone else did. And look at the damage it caused.	[]
Kyle	12	0	So now I should stop liking Chinpokoman because you all don't?	[]
Stan	2	0	...Ye-eah.	[]
Kyle	27	0	But if I stop now, I'll just be going with the group again. So, to be an individual, I have to bomb Pearl Harbor. See ya.	[]
Stan	28	0	Oh... Wait.  Actually, I was wrong. You see, Kyle, I learned something, just now. It is good to go with the group. A group mentality is healthy, sometimes.	[]
