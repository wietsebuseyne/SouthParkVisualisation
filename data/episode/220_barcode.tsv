Randy	2	0	Subliminal messages?	[]
Man 1	42	1	It's a musical thing. Women are so caught up in all the singing and dancing they don't even notice it but, there's a blowjob reference almost every ten seconds. Broadway writers call it subtext. Just listen really, really closely.	['blowjob']

Randy	18	0	Oh don't worry. I've taken care of everything! You're staying the weekend with the Feegans!	[]
Shelly	3	0	Not the vegans!	[]
Stan	7	0	No. Dad. Please don't do this!	[]
Mr. Feegan	42	0	It takes a lot of guts to be a vegan in today's world! You get labeled soft or silly.  But the truth is there isn't a need to eat animal products. Would you ever believe that hot dog was vegan?	[]
Shelly	1	0	Yes.	[]
Mr. Feegan	40	0	Cancer, heart disease, drowning, all preventable with a vegan diet and a life jacket. And if people wanna say us vegans are silly, well they can just laugh all they want, 'cause being vegan is more important than being popular!	[]
Shelly	10	0	Maybe you should let your son decide that for himself.	[]
Mr. Feegan	14	0	He does decide for himself! Larry's been a vegan since he was born!	[]
Shelly	22	0	Maybe if Larry had a nice steak once in a while he wouldn't get beat up by every kid in school.	[]
Mr. Feegan	43	0	You know that when you think you have the flu, you're actually experiencing the gastrointestinal effects of contaminated meats or eggs? Researchers have found that in meat-eating households there is more fecal bacteria in the kitchen sinks than in the toilets.	[]

Bob	1	0	Huh?	[]
Randy	28	0	Think about it, brah. How hard can writing a musical be? We need some musicians, some actors. We can put on our own shows right here in town.	[]

Elton John	15	0	You're making it too obvious! Women are gonna figure out what we're doin'!	[]
Sondheim	4	0	Musicals are about subtext!	[]
Randy	6	0	My musical has lots of subtext.	[]
Sondheim	23	1	A blowjob isn't with your mouth, it's with your heart. Now get on your knees and put that heart to work.	['blowjob']
Randy	8	0	And then she does. It's a metaphor.	[]
Schwartz	12	1	Bro! What's metaphorical about a musical called Splooge-Drenched Blowjob Queen?!	['blowjob']
Webber	18	2	Tricking bitches into hour-long blowjobs is an art form. You have to leave it to the professionals!	['bitches', 'blowjobs']
Randy	21	0	Well sorry if you guys think you have a monopoly on subtext! But us up-and-comers have a voice too!	[]

Randy	3	0	I can't!	[]
Sharon	1	0	WHY?!	[]
Randy	59	2	Aww! Alright, look. There's something I should have told you a long time ago, Sharon. Broadway musicals... aren't what you think they are! They're subliminal propaganda to get women to give more blowjobs! On the outside it's all singing and dancing, but buried in it are commands to perform oral sex. It's called subtext.	['blowjobs', 'sex']
Sharon	11	1	That's ridiculous! Musicals don't make me wanna give blowjobs!	['blowjobs']

Randy	1	0	Shelly!	[]
Sharon	6	0	Randy!  Randy, what are you doing?!	[]
Randy	13	0	It's time to put an end to Broadway once and for all!	[]
The Wizard	19	0	While you'll do great here in the Emerald City, I'm sure you can't wait to go!	[]
Singers	40	4	Take me away to that special place (that blowjob place) Where people like us can all live free (Free to give blowjobs) Take me away and let's live together That's the place/blowjobs for you (blowjobs) and me	['blowjob', 'blowjobs', 'blowjobs', 'blowjobs']

Field Reporter	50	0	The musical came to a screeching halt as patrons flooded out the exits and water flooded the theater.  The only fatality was a young boy who could not get out of the theater in time. The fire chief said it was unfortunate the child was not wearing a life preserver.	[]
Randy	46	0	Shelly, I'm sorry your little friend was killed by Spider-Man tonight. Just know that... for Spider-Man to do what he did, he must have had a very good reason. Spider-Man works in mysterious ways, Shelly. And wherever he is, he loves you.	[]
Randy	65	0	It's just so... wrong! For men to m- manipulate women like that! I don't care how much singing and dancing there is, a woman's mouth is sacred! Tomorrow I am calling Woman's Day magazine, and exposing the whole conspiracy!  I'm sorry, Sharon. I love you.  I shouldn't have tried to brainwash you. You have every right to be mad.	[]
Sharon	21	0	I don't know if I can really be that mad at you for doing something every guy in America does.	[]
Randy	1	0	Really?	[]
Sharon	36	0	Oh Randy,  the bottom line is I love going to those shows. If the fallout from that is I make you really happy for a while, well, I guess they're actually a pretty magical thing.	[]
Randy	6	0	Oh Sharon, you're the best.	[]
Sharon	12	0	So, what Broadway show do you think is coming to Denver next?	[]
Randy	28	0	I don't know, but whatever it is, it's worth the ticket price, because couples that pay to see it are stronger, better, and much, much happier.	[]
Announcer	9	1	The Book of Mormon. You'll get a blowjob.	['blowjob']
