Stan	9	0	Dude, did you do all your homework last night?	[]
Kyle	16	0	Yeah. But there was so much of it. I was up until two in the morning.	[]
Stan	2	0	I know!	[]
Mr. Garrison	41	0	Okay, children, I hope you all did your homework last night, because we're goin' to talk about pages 42 through 612. First of all, who can tell me what year the Founding Fathers got together?  Let's see, how about...	[]
Cartman	15	0	Please don't call on me. Please, Jesus, don't let him call on me.	[]
Mr. Garrison	1	0	Wendy?	[]
Cartman	1	0	Phew!	[]
Wendy	1	0	1776.	[]
Mr. Garrison	9	0	Good job, Wendy. And what was that document called?	[]
Cartman	17	0	Oh, please, God, don't let him call on me. Father in heaven, I beg of you-	[]
Mr. Garrison	1	0	Kyle?	[]
Cartman	7	0	Oh, thank you Low-ord! Praise Jesus!	[]
Kyle	4	0	The Declaration of Independence?	[]
Mr. Garrison	28	0	Very good, Kyle. Now, who can tell me what famous person wrote the Declaration of Independence?  Let's see. Oh, I know. How about the new student, Timmy?	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmiihh!	[]
Mr. Garrison	8	0	No, it wasn't you, Timmy. Try again.	[]
Timmy	2	0	Heh-aaaaaah!	[]
Mr. Garrison	7	0	Timmy, did you not do your homework?!	[]
Timmy	2	0	Erh Timmiihh!!	[]
Stan	11	1	Uh, Mr. Garrison, haven't you figured it out? Timmys' retarded.	['retarded']
Mr. Garrison	6	0	Don't call people names, Stanley!	[]
Stan	3	0	But he is-	[]
Mr. Garrison	2	0	Now, Timmy,-	[]
Timmy	1	0	Haaaaah.	[]
Mr. Garrison	8	0	-You need to work on your study skills!	[]
Timmy	2	0	Doo-uhh.	[]
Mr. Garrison	20	1	Are you mocking me?! Because if you are, I have no problem sending your butt to the principal's office!	['butt']
Timmy	9	0	G'oh livin' a lie, livin' a lie, Timmawh!	[]
Mr. Garrison	3	0	THAT DOES IT!	[]
Principal Victoria	31	0	Well, Timmy. I just don't know what to do with you. You're getting very poor marks in school and the teachers are complaining that you aren't paying attention.	[]
Timmy	2	0	Heh-aaaaaah!	[]
Mr. Mackey	20	0	Uh young man, if you don't wanna be held back a grade, I suggest you start cooperating, m'kay?!	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmiihh!	[]
Principal Victoria	17	0	Well, that does it! I'm suspending you, Timmy, until you can learn to respect your elders!	[]
Timmy	4	0	Ehhha-a-a-ah.	[]
Mr. Mackey	18	0	Huh- hold on just a second there, Principal Victoria.  I think I may know what the problem is.	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmiihh.	[]
Mr. Mackey	3	0	Yes, of course.	[]
Principal Victoria	1	0	What??	[]
Mr. Mackey	22	0	I think maybe Timmy is suffering from something called, Attention Deficit Disorder, or ADD. It's very common in kids his age.	[]
Principal Victoria	1	0	Oh!	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmiihh!	[]
Principal Victoria	6	0	Well, that certainly would explain it.	[]
Mr. Mackey	19	0	It should be easy enough to find out. They have tests for that kind of thing now, m'kay?	[]
Timmy	6	0	Oolih oo livin' a lie, Timmehuh!	[]
Clinic Doctor	21	0	Alright, this is a very simple test which should determine without a doubt whether or not Timmy has Attention Deficit Disorder.	[]
Principal Victoria	1	0	Good.	[]
Mr. Mackey	2	0	M'kay.	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmih.	[]
Clinic Doctor	35	0	Egh. Now, Timmy, I'm going to read you a book called, The Great Gatsby, by F. Scott Fitzgerald. At the end of the novel I'll ask you a few questions. Are you ready?	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmih.	[]
Clinic Doctor	42	0	Okay, here we go.  In my younger and more vulnerable years, my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since  so we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.	[]
Timmy	6	0	Ha-a-a-a-a-h.	[]
Clinic Doctor	17	0	Okay now, Timmy. Can you tell me: In Chapter 7, what kind of car did Gatsby drive?	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmih!	[]
Clinic Doctor	4	0	Well, that settles it!	[]
"Mr. Mackey, Principal Victoria"	1	0	Huh??	[]
Clinic Doctor	8	0	This young man definitely has Attention Deficit Disorder!	[]
Mr. Mackey	7	0	Oh oh, I nuh-I knew it.	[]
Principal Victoria	7	0	What can we do for him, doctor?	[]
Clinic Doctor	24	0	Well, ADD is fairly common in kids today. I'm gonna prescribe some Ritalin, and we'll see how that goes for little Timmy.	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmih.	[]
Mr. Garrison	21	0	Hurry up, children, let's take our seats.  You'd better have done your homework last night, Timmy.  What's this?	[]
Timmy	2	0	Tim-mih.	[]
Mr. Garrison	25	0	A note from the principal? Please excuse Timmy from all questions and all homework, as he has been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder.  Oh, brother!	[]
Stan	7	0	He doesn't have to do homework?	[]
Mr. Garrison	15	0	That's just swell, Timmy! Looks like you've outsmarted the principal and the counselor!	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmih.	[]
Mr. Garrison	9	0	Very well, I guess you're excused from homework.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Hey wait. I think maybe I have Attention Diffunction Disorder.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Yeah, me too.	[]
Stan	4	0	I've got ADD.	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Me too.)	[]
Other classmates	11	1	Yeah, I've got it. Me too. Yeah. It's gay.	['gay']
Clinic Doctor	43	0	After a while I went out and left the hospital, and walked back to the hotel in the rain.  Alright now, in Chapter 12, what kind of bottles did Miss Van Campen talk about?  Anybody?  Anybody?? My God, these children all have ADD!	[]
All the kids	1	0	Hooray.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Hoo-ray.	[]
Clinic Doctor	7	0	It's Ritalin for all of you!	[]
Drummer	3	0	Dude, we suck!	[]
Skyler	16	0	Hey, that's not the right attitude, Jonesy! The Battle of the Bands is tomorrow night!	[]
Jonesy	14	0	Dude, we never win the Battle of the Bands! It's no big deal.	[]
Skyler	22	0	Not a big deal! This year's winner gets to open for Phil Collins at Lalapalooblaza, and that's no big deal?!	[]
Mark	8	0	Hey, you guys, you'd better stop fighting.	[]
Skyler	6	0	We've just gotta practice more.	[]
Jonesy	9	0	Dude, we've been practicing for eight years, Skyler.	[]
Skyler	18	0	Hey, am I the leader of this band or not?! Huh, let's do it from the top!	[]
Timmy	3	0	Timmuuhh!  Coodalah Timmuh!	[]
Jonesy	3	0	What was that?	[]
Skyler	7	0	Huh-I don't know, man.  Whoaaa!	[]
Mark	3	0	Who is that?	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmiihh!	[]
Skyler	4	0	You a singer, man?	[]
Timmy	5	0	Rrrrr-laurlaurlah Timmehah!  Timmehuh!  Timmehh.	[]
Jonesy	4	0	Dude, that's hot!	[]
Skyler	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Pharmacist	12	0	There is your prescription, Ms. McCormick. A hundred dollars' worth of Ritalin.	[]
Mrs. McCormick	9	0	And he won't have Attention Deficit Disorder anymore?	[]
Pharmacist	6	0	We can only hope so. Next?	[]
Sharon	3	0	Oh, hi, Sheila.	[]
Sheila	8	0	Sharon, your son has Attention Deficit Disorder too?	[]
Sharon	27	0	Yes. I should have known. It all makes sense now. I could never get Stanley to pay attention when his grandfather told him stories about the '30s.	[]
Sheila	21	0	I know what you mean. Kyle gets so hyper, sometimes he runs around and screams like a little eight-year-old.	[]
Kyle	3	0	...I am eight.	[]
Pharmacist	10	0	Next, please?  What do we have here- ah! The Ritalin!	[]
Liane	1	0	Yes.	[]
Cartman	14	0	That's right. I got a bad case of ADD. No homework for me.	[]
Liane	12	0	Mr. Pharmacist, this Ritalin doesn't have any side effects, does it?	[]
Pharmacist	16	0	Oh, no no, your son may experience a small lack of energy, but that's all.	[]
Liane	1	0	Alright.	[]
Pharmacist	17	0	Oh, and he might start seeing little pink Christina Aguilera monsters, but that's to be expected.	[]
Liane	2	0	Oh my.	[]
Band	12	0	Look alive, lettin' it feel (so light). Lettin' it feel so light.	[]
People in Audience	1	0	Boooo!	[]
Guy in flat top	2	0	You suck!	[]
M.C.	25	0	Alright, that was Sisters of Mercy Hold No Pain Against the Dark Lord, with their song, Silk Blood On The Footsteps Of My Mind (Revisited)	[]
Singer	14	0	We got the best response. We'll be opening for Phil Collins for sure.	[]
M.C.	9	0	And now it's time for our final band.	[]
Guy in Audience	2	0	Thank God!	[]
M.C.	11	0	Give it up for Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld!	[]
Skyler	4	0	1 2 3 4	[]

The Lords	4	0	Lords of the Underworld.	[]
Timmy	2	0	Timmih, Timmiih!	[]
The Lords	6	0	Darkness fills my heart with pain.	[]
Timmy	5	0	Timmih oo livin' a lie!	[]
Stan	4	0	Dude, it's Timmy.	[]
Kyle	2	0	No way!	[]
Man 3	12	0	They're ridiculing that singer! Come on, let's get outta here!	[]
Timmy	2	0	Sibilah Sibinlaahh!	[]
The Lords	5	0	The Lords of the Underworld.	[]
Timmy	4	0	Timmih, Timmih Timmitimmi Timmiih!	[]
The Lords	6	0	Darkness fills my heart with pain.	[]
Timmy	11	0	Timmehahh! Timmeh Timmeh Sibinlah Timmih Sibinlah Timmih. Timmuh Timmuh Timmuh.  Timmeh!	[]
Cartman	3	0	That was awesuhome!	[]
Stan	3	0	Yeah, Timmy ruhules!	[]
Woman	10	0	Boys! You shouldn't laugh at him! He's handicapped!	[]
Stan	4	0	But he's funny.	[]
Woman	20	0	How would you like to be handicapped?! Do you think that would be funny?! You're making him feel bad!	[]
Timmy	1	0	Hehaahh!	[]
Stan	6	0	He looks pretty happy to me.	[]
Woman	6	0	Oh, you people make me sick!	[]
M.C.	28	0	Dude, this is a no-brainer. This year's Battle of the Bands winner and the band that gets to open for Phil Collins at Lalapalablala is... TIMMY!	[]
Crowd	1	0	Wooo!	[]
Jonesy	4	0	We did it, dude!	[]
Skyler	8	0	Listen to them. They really love me.  Wooo!!	[]
Crowd	1	0	Wooo!!	[]
Skyler	5	0	Yes! I'm a rocker!	[]
Charlie Rose	48	1	Tonight, we analyze the new rock sensation, Timmeo , the controversial new band that has taken the country by storm.  Already playing at several large venues this month , the band prepares for its biggest gig, Lolapalooblaza, where they will open for Phil Collins. But Phil Collins is not happy.	['analyze']
Phil Collins	39	0	Well, I thinks it's a horrible tragedy, idn't it? I mean, people aren't gonna see Timmy for his musical skills. They're laughin' at 'im, and I think you shouldn't laugh at people with disabilities!	[]
Man	2	0	Hah haha.	[]
Phil Collins	20	0	Society has to learn how to be more compassionate! This is gonna stop if I have to stop it myself!	[]
Kyle	12	0	Dude, did you see that stuff Phil Collins was saying about Timmy?	[]
Stan	13	1	Yeah, what a dick. Timmy's five times more talented than he is.	['dick']
Cartman	8	0	Hey guys, have you been takin' your Ritalin?	[]
Stan	10	0	Huh? No, we're not actually gonna take that stuff.	[]
Cartman	11	0	No, dude, you gotta try it.  It makes you feel good.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Good.)	[]
Chef	3	0	Hello there, children.	[]
"Stan, Kyle, Cartman"	2	0	Hello, Chef.	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Hello, Chef.)	[]
Chef	4	0	How's it goin'?	[]
"Stan, Kyle, Cartman"	4	0	Very well, thank you.	[]
Kenny	4	0	(Very well, thank you.)	[]
Chef	4	0	Everything's fine?? Why??	[]
Stan	5	0	Because we're on Ritalin.	[]
Chef	1	0	What??	[]
Kyle	12	0	We all have Attention Deficit Disorder. So we all started taking Ritalin.	[]
Cartman	11	0	It really takes the edge off, man. You should try it.	[]
Chef	12	1	So that's why all you children are acting so damned boring!	['damned']
Kyle	4	0	That's correct, Chef.	[]
Chef	39	3	Damnit, children, you don't need drugs to make you pay attention in school! In my day, if we didn't pay attention we got a belt to the bottom! Now they're tryin' to cure everything with drugs!	['damnit', 'drugs', 'drugs']
Kyle	21	0	Yes, but now we don't have any homework, so we can go see Timmy play downtown at Mile High Stadium	[]
Stan	4	0	Oh boy oh boy.	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Oh boy.)	[]
Chef	23	1	Oh, it makes me sick! Those damned psychologists prescribe all kinds of medicines to you children without even carin' about the side effects.	['damned']
Stan	7	0	But there are no side effects, Chef.	[]
Kyle	4	0	No, not at all.	[]
Christina Aguilera monster	1	0	Rown!	[]
Cartman	5	0	Did you guys see that?	[]
Stan	2	0	See what?	[]
Announcer	51	0	You're watching MTV, the cool, brainwashing, twelve-year-old-and-younger station that hides behind a slick image. We're so cool that we decide what's cool. And now, MTV News, the news that is singlehandedly dumbing down our country. Which is cool. Here's your host, Kurt Loder.	[]
Kurt Loder	22	0	Why am I still doing this? I've got to be the oldest person in this network by at least 40 years.	[]
Announcer	38	0	Kurt Loder didn't just say that. No way, he did just say it, but just to be cool. That's what makes him cool. You think Kurt Loder is cool. And now, the news that's cool.	[]
Kurt Loder	44	0	Well, it's only two weeks until Lalapalalababa, and the headlining band has changed. Now headlining the event is Timmy , the new hit sensation out of Colorado. This news came as a shock to the performer that was going to headline Lalapalabala, Phil Collins.	[]
Phil Collins	33	0	Well, I think the sad question is, Where are the parents in all this? I mean, that kid's parents are lettin' him be exploited, and they don't even seem to care.	[]
Kurt Loder	18	0	And so, Phil Collins decided to travel to South Park and personally pay Timmy's parents a visit.	[]
Phil Collins	24	0	Well, I mean, why are you lettin' 'em do this to your son? Don't you see that everyone's just laughin' at him?	[]
Richard	1	0	Richarrrrd!	[]
Helen	1	0	Helennnn!	[]
Richard	1	0	'Oodleahah.	[]
Kurt Loder	57	0	Phil Collins warns that a novelty band that makes fun of the handicapped should not be allowed to play Lalapalablalala, and vows to do everything in his power to stop it. Phil Collins, by the way, divorced his wife via fax and then married a 27-year-old. I'm Kurt Loder, and that's the news.	[]
Mr. Garrison	59	6	Okay, children, let's settle down!  Huhh I mean it; I want quiet!  My God, Mr. Hat, these children are so boring on Ritalin.  Huh, ah! Alright, children, today we're gonna learn about human reproduction. What do you think about that?!  Vaginas, and penises. Butt sex.  Well, dammit, Eric, don't you have some smartass thing to say?!	['vaginas', 'penises', 'butt', 'sex', 'dammit', 'smartass']
Cartman	10	1	What kind of smartass thing would I say, Mr. Garrison?	['smartass']
Mr. Garrison	15	1	This is driving me crazy!! I can't handle you little bastards being so mellow!!	['bastards']
Kyle	15	0	Gee, you seem a little stressed, Mr. Garrison. Why don't you try some Ritalin?	[]
Cartman	3	0	There you go.	[]
Christina Aguilera monster	1	0	Rowr.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Whah!	[]
A singer	6	0	Thank you, South Park! Good night!	[]
Jonesy	8	0	Alright, let's rock this house! Hello Miami!	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmiihh!	[]
Phil Collins	4	0	Excuse me, Skyler Moles?	[]
Skyler	1	0	Yeah?	[]
Phil Collins	8	0	Nice to meet you. I'm Phil Collins.	[]
Skyler	9	0	Oh, yeah. You're opening for us as Lalapalazabla.	[]
Phil Collins	20	0	I just wanted to tell you that, well, I think that you're a great guitar player and song writer.	[]
Skyler	9	0	Oh, thanks a lot. I appreciate that. Gotta run.	[]
Phil Collins	11	0	It's too bad those other guys are holdin' you back.	[]
Skyler	1	0	Huh?	[]
Phil Collins	37	0	Well, I mean, it's obvious all the talent and artistic vision in the band comes from you. Strange, how everyone focuses n Timmy, idn't it? I mean, even the name of the band is Timmy,	[]
Skyler	15	0	Nuh-nn, the name of the band is Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld.	[]
Phil Collins	71	1	Look, I used to be in a band, too. Genesis. And all those bastards did was hold me back and hold me back. But then, finally, I went solo. And that's when I started writing really great songs. But look, if you happen to be on the sidelines, you know, bein' more of a cheerleader than a player, well, then I guess you should stay on as Timmy's shadow.	['bastards']
Skyler	5	0	Uh, thanks man. See ya.	[]
Phil Collins	12	0	That should just about put an end to all this Timmy nonsense.	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmuh!	[]
Jonesy	14	0	Another great show, man. There must have been a hundred thousand people out there.	[]
Skyler	7	0	Yeah. All of them chanting Timmy, Timmy.	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmih!	[]
Jonesy	5	0	What's the matter, Skyler?	[]
Skyler	16	0	The name of the band is Timmy AND the Lords of the Underworld, not just Timmy.	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmiihh!	[]
Skyler	6	0	And the Lords of the Underworld!	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmiihh!	[]
Skyler	30	0	It's always about you, isn't it?! I'm sick of it! Timmy gets all the applause! Timmy gets all the chicks! Well, you know what?! Forget you, man!	[]
Mark	8	0	Skyler, Timmy is what made our band famous.	[]
Skyler	26	0	Shut up, Monsy! You can stay and deal with Mr. Egomaniac here, but I'm movin' on!  I don't need Timmy!  I'm goin' solo!	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmiihh!	[]
Skyler	16	0	No! Don't try and stop me, man!  I'll see you on fame's backside.	[]
Timmy	4	0	Ooo livin' a lie!	[]
Phillip	8	0	Terrance, what brand of pants am I wearing?	[]
Terrance	3	0	Let me see.	[]
Phillip	6	0	How do you like that, Terrance?	[]
Stan	5	0	Let's watch something else.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Yes, let's.	[]
Announcer	4	0	You're watching VH1.	[]
The Boys	1	0	Ahhhh.	[]
Anchor	12	0	Here's Lalapalalala's news. The hit group Timmy has broken up.	[]
Stan	7	0	Oh dear. Timmy's band broke up?	[]
Anchor	28	0	And so, Phil Collins is back on as the headliner. The opening band now will be Timmy's guitarist Skyler's new solo project, Reach for the Skyler.	[]
Kyle	16	0	You know something? I think that's good. It was wrong to make Timmy a singer.	[]
Stan	21	0	Yeah. Phil Collins was right. People laughed at Timmy, and Timmy should be at home, where he's protected from laughter.	[]
Cartman	18	0	I agree. You know what, you guys? We should go to the concert anyways and see Phil Collins.	[]
Kyle	8	0	Yeah. I think Phil Collins rocks the house.	[]
Stan	2	0	Sounds good.	[]
Cartman	17	0	So it's decided: Phil Collins concert for all of us.  Hooray.  Oh oh. Hold still, Kenny.	[]
Stan	6	0	Oh my goodness, you killed Kenny.	[]
Kyle	1	1	Bastard.	['bastard']
Chef	20	0	Parents, I called you all together because I think you might be making a mistake puttin' your children on Ritalin.	[]
Randy	18	0	Uh, but our kids have Attention Deficit Disorder, Chef. They can't pay attention in school without it.	[]
Chef	47	0	I know you wanna help your kids, but I brought over a videotape to show you that there are alternative' to Ritalin. There's this doctor in Northern California who is doin' real amazing things with kids who have ADD. I want you to watch this tape.	[]
Dr. Shay	45	2	Hello, I'm Dr. Richard Shay, here to tell you about my exciting new drug-free treatment for children with Attention Deficit Disorder.  This treatment is fast and effective and doesn't use harmful drugs. Watch closely as I apply treatment to the first child.	['drug', 'drugs']
Girl	21	0	I want a horse. I want a big brown horse with a brown-and-black tail, and a diamond tiara-  Ah!	[]
Dr. Shay	4	0	Sit down and study!	[]
Boy 1	14	0	Woohoo, let's go sledding, let's go race and race, let's go!	[]
Dr. Shay	4	0	Sit down and study!	[]
Boy 1	1	0	Wwaaahahahahaaha	[]
Dr. Shay	41	0	Stop crying and do your schoolwork!  If you would like more information on my bold new treatments, please send away for this free brochure, entitled, You can either calm down, or I can pop you in the mouth again. Thank you.	[]
Chef	18	0	Well, what do you think? I can have Dr. Shay come to South Park for a small fee.	[]
Sharon	5	0	That video had pretty colors.	[]
Gerald	3	0	It sure did.	[]
Chef	13	1	What the...? Dammit! Have you all been taking your children's Ritalin too?!	['dammit']
Parents	1	0	Yes.	[]
Chef	3	0	Awww, fudge it!	[]
Stan	10	0	Chef, are you going to the Phil Collins concert tomorrow?	[]
Chef	2	0	The what?	[]
Kyle	24	0	Phil Collins is playing Lalapalala's, and because we're all doing so well in school now, our parents said they would take us.	[]
Parents	1	0	Yes.	[]
Chef	12	0	Hold on a second: you children want to go see Phil Collins?	[]
Kyle	9	0	Yes. His flowing melodies are really enjoyable to us.	[]
Chef	3	0	Oh my God!!	[]
Kyle	5	0	Come, see him with us.	[]
Cartman	19	0	Yes, come with us. Come with uusss. Haaa, it's Christina Aguilera again!  She's on my back! Hah!	[]
Chef	22	1	That does it! That Ritalin has affected your little cracker brains too deeply! I'm going to go see that damn pharmacist!	['damn']
Pharmacist	9	0	Look at that. Ritalin stocks are up ten points.	[]
Clinic Doctor	7	0	That's easily another twenty grand apiece!	[]
Chef	5	1	Hey, open this damn door.	['damn']
Pharmacist	4	0	Can I help you?	[]
Chef	15	1	Yes you can! What the hell are you two doin' prescribing all the children Ritalin?!	['hell']
Clinic Doctor	12	0	Well, they've all been diagnosed with ADD. That's Attention Deficit-	[]
Chef	20	0	I know what it is! But now you've got a town full of zombie children from the planet Zandor.	[]
Clinic Doctor	1	0	Huh?	[]
Chef	29	1	All around the country, you bastard doctors are giving children Ritalin! And for every one child that actually needs it, you give it to 50,000 that don't!	['bastard']
Clinic Doctor	12	0	Hey now, don't tell us our business, Mr. Chef. Why, we-	[]
Chef	33	2	You're damn right I'll tell you yo' business, because you two have got your heads up your asses! Thanks to you, we have children in our town that like Phil Collins!	['damn', 'asses']
Pharmacist	3	0	Eh wuh, what??	[]
Chef	23	0	That's right! You've made them so dull and boring that they're actually going to go to a Phil Collins concert!	[]
Clinic Doctor	7	0	Mm- my God. What have we done??	[]
Pharmacist	10	0	Well, if I had known... Phil Collins, uh, my God!	[]
Chef	7	0	Well, how do we reverse the Ritalin?!	[]
Clinic Doctor	23	0	We uh... have to convince them not to take it, but, ahah ih it'll be hard to get it away from them.	[]
Chef	5	0	Then we need an antidote!	[]
Pharmacist	3	0	Yes, of course.	[]
Clinic Doctor	7	0	Uh, what's the antidote for Ritalin?	[]
Pharmacist	11	0	I have some right here.  It's a compound called Ritalout.	[]
Chef	15	0	Alright. Come on, we've got to get the antidote to all the children. Quick!	[]
Phil Collins	10	0	Last night I went, O!BubudioLast night I went Bubudio	[]
Chef	17	0	Here. We can put the Ritalin antidote in these drinks and hand them out to the children.	[]
Phil Collins	6	0	Last night I went, O!Bububudio.	[]
Randy	5	0	Wasn't that great, son?	[]
Stan	3	0	Sure was, Dad.	[]
Gerald	13	0	It's so wonderful to be on the same wavelength as our kids.	[]

Stan	9	0	Get off the stage, Phil Collins! We want Timmy!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Phil Collins	6	0	You just wanna laugh at him.	[]
Stan	110	0	No!  You see, we learned something today. Yeah, sure, we laughed at Timmy, but what's wrong with laughter? Just because we laugh at something doesn't mean we don't care about it. Timmy made us smile, and playing made Timmy smile, so where was the harm in that? The people that are wrong are the ones that think people like Timmy should be protected and kept out of the public's eye. The cool thing about Timmy being in a band was that he was in your face, and you had to deal with him, whether you laughed or cried, or felt nothing. That's why Timmy rules!	[]
