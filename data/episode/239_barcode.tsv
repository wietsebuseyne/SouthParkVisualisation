Cartman	7	0	Boooo, Wendy Testaburger, Boooooo!__Boo Wendy! Liar!	[]
Wendy	13	0	Instead of booing my opinion, why don't you make a constructive argument?!	[]
Cartman	23	1	I'm not booing your opinion, I'm booing your report topic. No one even knows what a refewgee is. Boo, booben, boo.	['booben']
Wendy	11	0	Mr. Garrison, can you do something about this, please?__Mr. Garrison?!	[]
Mr. Garrison	19	0	Huh? Oh, oh, Wendy, uhhh, very nicely done. Thank you. Okay, next report,__let's have uh, Peter Mullen.	[]
Wendy	3	0	Ugh, Jesus!_	[]
Peter	45	1	My report is on the vile and despicable trash that our parents are watching on television. Fellow students: there is a plague of smut on our cable boxes!__Shows that feature reenactments of unsolved crimes and spousal homicide!__I'm talking of course about__murder porn!	['porn']
Butters	2	1	Murder porn?	['porn']
Cartman	5	0	That's more like it.	[]
Peter	123	1	According to the Nielsen ratings, viewership in shows like Cold Case Files, Dateline: Murder, and Deadly Affairs is skyrocketing amongst married couples. The increased viewership has brought about a whole new slew of shows that use graphic sex, and innuendo, to make spousal murder more titillating. Shows like Southern Fried Homicide, Sinful Secrets, On The Case with Paula Zahn. And it's all smut and it's garbage and it's__trash!__Your parents are watching this stuff! Go home and ask them! And as we ask them we must also ask ourselves, If they're obsessed with this stuff, then how long? How long before one of our daddies dresses up in lingerie and bashes Mommy's head in with a brick?_	['sex']
Randy	30	2	Oh crap, who could that be-?! Oh it's, it's, probably fuckin' Stan! Ah, hang on a second bud.__Come on it.__Oh hey Stan, what's up?_	['crap', 'fuckin']
Narrator	22	1	His wife is having sex with the neighbor.__And when her husband comes home,__he wants more than just a divorce._	['sex']
Stan	6	1	You guys are watchin' murder porn?	['porn']
Randy	10	1	...Murder porn? Stan, this is just an investigative crime show.	['porn']
Sharon	4	0	Uh adults like documentaries.	[]
Randy	19	0	Yes Stan, these are based on real things. This is like news. It's informative. Parents like informative stuff.	[]
Stan	2	0	Okaaay._	[]
Randy	10	0	Oh we missed the murder! Did he cut them up?!	[]
Stan	4	0	What's up dude?	[]
Cartman	6	0	Dude, do you know Aaron Hagen?	[]
Stan	5	0	Yhh, yeah, the first grader?	[]
Cartman	13	0	You should come down to his house. His dad just killed his mom.	[]
Stan	1	0	...What?!	[]
Sergeant Yates	8	0	Hey that kid should not be seeing this!	[]
Stan	2	0	What happened?	[]
Dad	39	2	You're making a mistake!__Let me go! It wasn't me, I tell ya! A burglar broke in! He was black! He's the one who stabbed that nagging bitch in her fat face! He was blaaack!_	['bitch', 'fat']
Kyle	14	0	Guys, guys, I know we're all concerned, but we have to work together!	[]
Red	10	0	How is this stuff allowed to stay on the air?!	[]
Clyde	19	1	The police found hours and hours of murder porn on the Hagens' DVR. What more proof do we need?!	['porn']
Butters	40	0	I called the networks that are putting this smut out there, and you know what they told me?! They told me if I didn't want my parents watchin', then I should spend more time with them! Like it's_my_fault!	[]
Wendy	14	0	This is the result of a broken society in which profits come before morals!	[]
Cartman	5	0	Boooooooooo. Boooo Wendy Testaburger! Boo!	[]
Kyle	52	0	Look everybody, I know we all feel our hands are tied, but the fact is, we_can_do something about this. There's an app which can actually allow kids to block things that their parents watch on television. And it is password-protected with a security code that only a child would know.	[]
Narrator	47	2	Tonight at 10, it's a tale of lust, seduction, and murder, on Sexy Betrayals.__Then at 7, some like their murder with a side of sexy biscuits,__on Southern Fried Homicide. But now, get ready for lust, betrayal and murder,__on Hot Load Case Files._	['sexy', 'sexy']
Randy	10	0	Oh yeah!__Three of the best shows in a row!	[]
Sharon	5	0	Is the lube over there?	[]
Randy	6	0	Yeah, I got lube right here.	[]
Sharon	6	0	Well get over here, big guy.	[]
Randy	3	0	Yeah-hah!_	[]
Randy	55	3	What the?__What the hell?__Yeah, hi, uhh, we aren't getting our informative murder porn. No, no, none of our channels that have informative murder porn appear to be working. Yeah, the screen just says How do you tame a horse in Minecraft? Uhhh yes, we do have children. A what? A parental lock?	['hell', 'porn', 'porn']
Randy	10	0	Stan. Stan!__How do you tame a horse in Minecraft?	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Randy	12	0	What is Minecraft and how do you tame a horse in it?!	[]
Stan	11	0	You guys don't need to be watching that stuff._	[]
Randy	119	1	Oh come on! You can't block your parents from watching informative murder porn! What? You, you think if we watch shows about married people killing each other all the time we're gonna go out and do it?! That's stupid!__I'm not gonna go out and kill your mom just because I watch Investigate Discovery, Stan! It'd be impossible to clear away all the DNA evidence anyway! Even if I hired someone else to kill her, I'd have to kill that person too, because 96% of the time that person eventually tells the truth! I thought this through a lot!__Stan?__You're a lousy kid! I wish Jaden Smith was my son!_	['porn']
Stephen	11	0	Who do out children think they are?! Blocking our TV content?!	[]
Mrs. Tweak	10	0	How are they able to do this with their smartphones?	[]
Randy	31	0	It's all right. Our kids think they've outsmarted us, but we're the ones who pay the cable company!__What'd they say? Can they remove the parental lock?	[]
Stuart	9	0	No, they just did their usual cable-company runaround.	[]
Randy	18	0	What?! We'll see about this!__Excuse me, our content is being blocked and we need it now!	[]
Cable Guy	37	0	I'm sorry sir. If you need it now, perhaps you should switch to another cable company.__Ohhh there's not another cable company, is there?__Ohhh, that's right, we're the only one in town.	[]
Randy	15	0	Look, if our kids can block content, then you must be able to block them!	[]
Cable Guy	27	0	As we told the others, sir, we can fix it. We just need to send a technician out to your house to change out your cable box.	[]
Randy	4	0	Oh. Well okay, great.	[]
Cable Guy	28	0	We'll just need to find a window of time you can be home... How about between the hours of 6 am and 3 pm all of November?	[]
Randy	17	0	NO, I can't wait around my house from 6 am to 3 pm all of November!	[]
Cable Guy	24	0	Oh, you can't?__Jeez that's too bad. You need to be home for the technician. Have you thought of switching to DirecTV?	[]
Randy	5	0	I can't afford DirecTV.	[]
Cable Guy	21	0	Oh, you can't?__Jeez, that's terrible. Then I guess you just have to work within our time windows._	[]
Stephen	3	0	Well? Any luck?	[]
Randy	7	0	No, just the usual cable-company stuff.	[]
Mrs. Tweak	14	0	Oh well, guess we'll just have to live without our informative crime drama.	[]
Stephen	20	0	No, screw that! Can't we just learn this Minecraft game so we can get around our kids' parental lock?	[]
Randy	38	0	I've tried! It's not like other video games. I really don't get it. It was all retro and like Legos, but, then a bunch of kids online called me a griefer and kicked me off.	[]
Stephen	22	0	We can learn, Randy. There's talk of a child. Word is he will teach Minecraft to anybody for the right price.	[]
Boy	1	0	Hello?	[]
Randy	3	0	Hi. Corey Lanskin?	[]
Corey	1	0	Yes?	[]
Randy	11	0	We heard that... you're willing to teach Minecraft to adults?	[]
Corey	3	1	Fuck off!_	['fuck']
Randy	13	0	Look, we were told that you were available for hire and we're_desperate!	[]
Corey	18	0	You was told wrong, mistuh! I'm just a simple kid with a simple passion for simple things!	[]
Randy	8	0	We have a hundred ounces of silver._	[]
Corey	10	0	Wipe your feet and turn off your cell phones._	[]
Corey	33	0	Next we're going to select an empty world. Selecting an empty world will begin with you being dropped onto a beach. Now you're free to roam around and start punching trees!	[]
Gerald	2	0	Punching trees?	[]
Randy	6	0	Why, why would we punch trees?	[]
Corey	16	1	Just use your fucking brain! How do you get wood?__'Ow do you get wood?!	['fucking']
Randy	4	1	Watching informative murder porn?	['porn']
Corey	11	0	NOO NOO, in this Minecraft forest, how do you get wood?!	[]
Randy	3	0	Puh, punching trees?	[]
Corey	17	0	Riiight. You punch the trees to get the wood, you get the wood to build a cabin.	[]
Randy	9	0	Oh, I see. So when does the game start?	[]
Corey	5	0	You_are_playing the game; this_is_the game!	[]
Randy	5	0	...I don't get it.	[]
Corey	53	2	That's because you're thinkin' like a dad. Minecraft, it don't got no winner. It don't got no objective. You just fuckin' build an' shit. And seein' if other things can come and knock it down. Now, let's click on the inventory, and let's filter through the skin!	['fuckin', 'shit']
Randy	7	0	Yes ah, I'm getting it now.	[]
Gerald	2	0	You are?	[]
Randy	1	0	No.	[]
Sharon	11	0	Randy, it's getting late. Let's just go to sleep.	[]
Randy	22	0	I almost got it, Sharon. I found out where the horse is; now I just gotta figure out how to tame one.	[]
Sharon	9	0	I'm really not in the mood now anyway.	[]
Randy	25	0	Sharon, I miss being intimate with you! Everything was so passionate and then it just... dropped off. I feel like we're losing our bond.	[]
Sharon	13	1	We don't have to have sex for our relationship to be good.	['sex']
Randy	39	1	No,_I_know, but it's like we're just good friends. A marriage has to be more than that! A marriage has to include fulfillment of fantasy and desire sometimes. Magma cube? What the hell is a magma cube?	['hell']
Sharon	7	0	Well I'm going to sleep, Randy.	[]
Randy	13	1	Okay, I'll wake you up if we get our murder porn back.	['porn']
Jimmy	18	1	There he is. Hey Kyle!__The parental lock isn't working. Our parents are still watching murder porn.	['porn']
Kyle	5	0	What? How do you know?	[]
Tweek	22	0	I caught my parents over at Bebe's house watching Sunsets of Homicide. But Bebe got the lock from the cable company!	[]
Craig	19	0	It's true. I walked in on my parents watching Marital Murder Mayhem. They broke the parental lock somehow.	[]
Stan	12	0	That's impossible. Are you guys sure you set it up right?	[]
Cartman	10	0	You guys?__You guys, you'd better get over here.	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Cartman	6	0	Butters' dad killed his mom._	[]
Stan	3	0	Butters, what happened?	[]
Butters	66	0	I was out by the lake last night and I saw my dad out in this field. He was harvesting sugarcane. It didn't make any sense because he was trying to harvest the sugarcane with a hammer. I saw him take my mom up to the top of this big... thing he had built, and he yelled Hey, watch out for the Creepers! but she_fell!	[]
Stan	6	0	Wait... wait, you mean in Minecraft?	[]
Butters	28	0	Yeah. And then my dad just went berserk and came over and picked me up and threw me down a well!__I was trapped down there all night!	[]
Mr. Mackey	8	0	Butters, your dad threw you down a well?	[]
Stan	2	0	In Minecraft.	[]
Mr. Mackey	6	1	Well what the hell is that?	['hell']
Butters	45	0	I finally found a ladder and I was able to hoist myself out and there was my dad... frozen in the lake! It was like he had no idea how to swim out of it! Oh God it was so terrible! It was so terrible!	[]
Kyle	19	0	That's it.__That's how our parents broke the passcode. I never thought anyone would stoop so low!	[]
Stan	2	0	Whattaya mean?	[]
Kyle	7	0	Someone is teaching our parents Minecraft._	[]
Randy	1	0	Yes?	[]
Officer 1	15	0	Hello sir, had a little incident last night, wondering if you saw or heard anything?	[]
Randy	3	0	No, what happened?	[]
Officer 1	23	0	Well, someone broke into your next door neighbor's back yard and they... dug up a bunch of holes and punched his trees.	[]
Randy	4	0	Punched his trees, huh?	[]
Officer 1	20	0	Yes sir. Then we got a house across the street where someone dug up the yard and... built a cabin.	[]
Randy	4	0	Huh.__That's weird.	[]
Officer 1	6	0	What were you doing last night?	[]
Randy	8	0	I was just playing Mi- mmmmuh... my banjo.	[]
Officer 2	5	0	I play the banjo too.	[]
Officer 1	29	0	Well, thanks for your time sir. You might wanna keep the lights on in your yard tonight in case someone tries to build a cabin on it as well.	[]
Randy	6	0	Will do, officer. Will... do..._	[]
Kyle	13	0	Alright, alright, let's calm down! I know we're all concerned here!	[]
Cartman	23	1	Concerned?! Thanks to you and your stupid app, parents are still watching murder porn, and now they're screwing up Minecraft too!_	['porn']
Craig	32	0	I spent three hours last night trying to get Tweek's parents to stop griefing my castle! When I finally got away from them, I found they had taken all my dandelions!	[]
Clyde	8	0	Why did we agree to that stupid app?!	[]
Kyle	15	1	You know why! Because we're trying to keep our parents from watching murder porn!	['porn']
Cartman	44	2	And why was that?! Because one kid's dad actually went and killed his mom! For all we know, that kid's parents have been doing drugs and cheating on each other for years! Maybe watching murder porn had nothin' to do with it!	['drugs', 'porn']
Wendy	12	0	I have to agree with Cartman. Maybe we overreacted when our parents-	[]
Cartman	4	0	Boooooo! Boo Wendy, boooo.	[]
Stan	21	0	It's true, dude. Maybe we just need to trust that our parents won't act out what they see._	[]
Officer 3	24	0	All right, that's enough. Come on out and there won't be any trouble.__Give it up, Stotch. You've nowhere to run.	[]
Butters	1	0	Huh?	[]
Stephen	17	0	I'll never give up!_ I don't even remember doing this!_Just leave me alone!	[]
Randy	9	1	Huhuh. Oh nice one, Stotch! Your castle fuckin' sucks!	['fuckin']
Stephen	6	1	Aw, go to hell, you griefer!	['hell']
Cartman	6	0	Alright, we've gotta do something.	[]
Corey	1	0	Hello?	[]
Kyle	2	0	Corey Lanskin?	[]
Corey	2	0	Eh yes?	[]
Kyle	10	0	We heard that you might be teaching Minecraft to adults.	[]
Corey	8	0	Whaaa? What's a, what's a Minequaf?	[]
Stan	23	0	Look dude, we're trying to keep our parents away from graphic television shows! This could be a matter of life and death!	[]
Corey	32	1	Oh no, please don't be angry. My mommy's always angry. Get back in the meat locker! Ouchie ouchie Mommy raped my nono! But she loves me, right? Mommy loves me?	['raped']
Kyle	11	0	Uh alright, sorry kid. Gue- guess we have the wrong house.	[]

Stan	2	0	What, dude?	[]
Cartman	15	1	Something he said. Did you hear him? He said Ouchie ouchie Mommy raped my nono!	['raped']
Stan	1	0	So?	[]
Cartman	18	0	You know, if I'd been caught lying about something, that's exactly what I would have said.	[]

Kenny	7	0	(I knew you're up to something!)	[]
Cartman	22	1	Son of a bitch!__Don't you think there are enough griefers in the world without our parents being shown this stuff?!	['bitch']
Corey	12	0	Kids gotta find some way to make a livin', don't 'e?	[]
Stan	23	0	You have no idea what this is about, do you?! We were using Minecraft to block our parents from watching spousal homicide shows!	[]
Corey	6	0	What? You mean like Investigation Discovery?	[]
Kyle	4	0	So you know it.	[]
Corey	26	1	Yeah, I've seen that stuff.__'Oo The Bleep Did I Marry?, True Crime with Aphrodite Jones. Real sick shit. Your parents watch that stuff?	['shit']
Kyle	11	0	We put a stop to it, until YOU taught them Minecraft.	[]
Corey	55	0	Your problem ain't with me, mates. Sure, one or two people might act out what they see in video games, but cable television?__People copy everything they see people do on cable. You're goin' about this all wrong. You wanna protect your family? You're gonna have to go fight the cable company.	[]
Cable Guy	6	0	Hey guys, can I help you?	[]
Kyle	19	0	Hello. There are certain networks that we see as harmful to our families, and we want them removed, please.	[]
Cable Guy	7	0	Ohhh, you don't want cable anymore?	[]
Stan	19	1	No no,_ just Ivy Network, A&E, Oxygen, and Oprah's network. All the ones with murder porn.	['porn']
Cable Guy	16	0	You don't like paying for all the channels?__Ohh, our company actually packages channels together.	[]
Stan	13	0	Look, can you unpackage them so we only get the channels we want?	[]
Cable Guy	44	0	Oh I'm sorry. Our company doesn't work that way.__You want me to give you the number of a different cable company that can-__Oh wait, we're it, aren't we?__Dangit, I guess you have to deal with our packages.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Can we talk to your supervisor please?!	[]
Cable Guy	4	0	Oh, sure. Hey David?	[]
David	7	0	Hi, is there a problem here?_	[]
Stan	8	0	We want specific networks dropped from our cable.	[]
David	20	0	Ohhh you have to pay for the bundle. You can't just pay for what you wanna watch. Darn it.	[]
Kyle	12	0	You mean that we're forced to pay for the Oprah channel?	[]
Cable Guy	22	0	I guess if you don't wanna be_forced to pay for Oprah, you're gonna have to shut off your cable altogether.	[]
Kyle	9	0	Fine,__then we'll shut our cable off altogether!	[]
David	13	0	Hey Mitch? When can you get out to shut off some cable boxes?	[]
Mitch	25	0	Oh man, it's gonna be like three weeks. There's a whole plug I have to pull out; it's like four inches long.	[]
David	13	0	Three weeks, huh? Okay, is three weeks from now okay with you guys?	[]
Stan	6	0	No, that's way too long!	[]
Cable Guy	3	0	Oh it is?	[]
David	5	0	Oh Jeez, that's terrible.	[]
Stan	119	2	Goddammit, I just don't want my parents to murder each other!__Can't you see that all we're trying to do is keep our families safe? Look, ah I don't know if seeing couples murder each other on television is gonna make my parents do it, and we probably won't be able to stop them from watching what they wanna watch. All we're trying to do is make it a little more difficult for them. Because cable makes is so convenient. Sure, if they didn't have easy access to their murder porn channels, they'd be bummed out, but it's not just our responsibility to give them what they want. Is it?	['goddammit', 'porn']
David	6	0	Say... say that last part again?	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
David	8	0	Well what was the last part you said?	[]
Stan	13	0	I said it's not our responsibility to give them what they want.	[]
David	11	0	Nono, the part about your parents not getting the channels easily?	[]
Stan	8	1	I... said it would really bum them out.	['bum']
David	8	1	How...__How much would it bum them out?	['bum']
Announcer	18	0	Ladies and gentlemen, please stand by for an important message from the president of your local cable company.	[]
President	103	2	Hello. In an effort to comfort the anguished cries or children everywhere, your local cable company has decided to drop all networks that sexualize spousal homicides from regular programming. Customers still wishing to view true-crime networks will now need to purchase a separate package__which will require a technician to service your cable box every night from 2 to 3 am. and must include the purchase of 300 channels in Portuguese. We realize this may be an inconvenience to you, and we hope you will voice ALL your concerns to us, because at your local cable company the customer is always... our bitch.	['sexualize', 'bitch']
Randy	56	1	Jaden Smith lets his parents do whatever they want. You know what? The guys at work, they took a bet on who would win in a fight, you or Jaden Smith, and they all said Jaden Smith could kick your ass! He does movies and he can sing, and he's totally cool to his parents!	['ass']
Stan	11	0	Well then maybe you should go live with Jaden Smith, Dad.	[]

Randy	7	0	Sharon, I'm I'm sorry._	[]
Sharon	19	1	No, you'r right, Randy. Without any sex we just seem to get madder and madder at each other.	['sex']
Randy	46	1	No, no, you're right, Sharon. We don't need informative murder porn to find passion in our marriage. We just have to get the spark back. Let's go away somewhere, me and you! Somewhere exciting and beautiful where we can just focus on us.	['porn']
