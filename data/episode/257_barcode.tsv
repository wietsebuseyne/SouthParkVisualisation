Kyle	16	0	Well, I finally got my family to use the living room for an hour each night.	[]
Stan	14	0	I'm still really confused, dude. I have no idea what that was about.	[]
Kyle	52	0	Yeah. I guess that's the point. I don't think we're gonna understand. Maybe this IS all the beginning of a new art form. YouTube celebrities are only getting bigger. And what's great is that these people are inventing themselves, instead of being marketed and shoved down our throats.	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Kyle	30	0	No matter what we think, it's not just a passing trend. We need to realize that the new generation of entertainment is here.__And I, think that's great.	[]
Stan	7	0	Yeah, I think that's great too.	[]
