Stan	8	0	You find a good catcher's mitt, Cartman?	[]
Cartman	13	0	Dude, how come when we play baseball I have to be the catcher?	[]
Kyle	13	2	Well, because you got good coordination, sharp reflexes, and you're fucking fat.	['fucking', 'fat']
Cartman	5	1	I'm not fat, Kyle.	['fat']
Kyle	5	1	Right, you're not fat.	['fat']
Cartman	16	2	Dude, I'm not fat! I don't drive around on a mobility scooter like  bitch!	['fat', 'bitch']
Stan	2	0	Whoa duude!	[]
Kyle	14	0	Jesus Christ, you can't even walk down an aisle to get your candy?	[]
Obese Man	4	0	Excuse me.  Excuse me!	[]
Cartman	25	2	See what I mean? You can't even walk around a Wall-Mart anymore without getting run over by some fat dick on a Rascal.	['fat', 'dick']
Kyle	9	0	Why do they even allow those things in stored?	[]
Stan	13	0	They don't just allow them, they have them available at the front.	[]
Kyle	6	0	You've gotta be kidding me!	[]
Cartman	19	1	Oh my God you guys, look at this!  Candy Corn Oreos. Oreos with candy corn filling.  Holy hell yes!	['hell']
Kyle	35	0	Are you serious?? Look around: doesn't this bother you at all??  That's YOU one day, fatass! Not even one day! If you don't change something, that's you! In about a year!	[]
Obese Lady	5	0	Are those Candy Corn Oreos?	[]
Cartman	5	0	Yeah... Yeah, here you go.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Hey Kyle, can I come in for a second?	[]
Kyle	1	0	Why?	[]
Cartman	62	7	I've been... doing a lot of thinking... about what you said at Wall-Mart.  You're right Kyle. I'm fat.  All these years you tell me and me saying No, I'm big-boned or no, that's just muscle... It was always just me living in denial. I'm fucking fat, Kyle. I'm fucking fat as fucking fuck.	['fat', 'fucking', 'fat', 'fucking', 'fat', 'fucking', 'fuck']
Kyle	15	0	Cartman, uh, all I was trying to tell you at Wall-Mart was that you-	[]
Cartman	44	1	No! It's okay, Kyle... because... I'm not gonna live like some... slug who can't even leave his house 'cause he can't get around. Now that I can admit I'm fat, I decided to finally do something about it.  Sweeeeeeeeeet!	['fat']
Kyle	2	0	Oh no!	[]
Cartman	40	0	Don't know what took me so long, dude. All I needed was a few extra pounds and the insurance company paid for my own private one! See? It's got a basket in front for my candy corn Oreos.	[]
Kyle	9	0	You don't need that! Get off of it.	[]
Cartman	32	0	Dude, it's sweet. Did you know they make access for mobility scooters everywhere? I can seriously go from my bed to Wall-Mart and never have to touch the floor, once.	[]
Kyle	12	0	That's not what I meant by doing something about it, Cartman!	[]
Cartman	14	0	Hmm.  I can't.  I can't seem to get into your bathroom, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	1	0	What??	[]
Cartman	32	1	Yeap. No, this is the problem, Kyle.  You've gottam make your bathroom accessible for my mobility scooter or else I won't be able to take a shit in your house.	['shit']
Kyle	6	1	So take a shit somewhere else!	['shit']
Cartman	24	0	That's not the way this country works, Kyle.  Your bathroom has to be to code for my mobility scooter.  It's the law.	[]
Gerald	6	0	What's going on down here?	[]
Cartman	64	1	Can't seem to be able to take a dump in your house, Mr. Broflovski. Doesn't appear to be handicap-accessible.  I'll look past it this time, but you'd better get that bathroom up to code of you don't want a lawsuit.  Well, I'm off to go try to take a shit at Best Buy, guys. See you, Kyle.	['shit']
Cartman	9	0	Out of the way. Out of the way please.	[]
Greeter	10	0	Uhh I guess take that big booth by the window.	[]
Ticket Teller	18	0	Okay, we're finally gonna start with pre-boarding. Anyone needing special assistance getting on the aircraft- Oh...	[]
Cartman	88	4	Coming through. Oh how humiliating.  Scuse me. Gotta go to the front of the line. Oh what shame I feel.  Oh jeez, look how fat I am. I'm just mortified, you guys. Can't believe I have-  Ay! The fuck is this?! There's a wait for the Rascal line?! He-hay! That kid in the middle isn't even fat! Look at him! He's got no right to be on a Rascal! You're not fooling anybody asshole! Walk to the back of the line!	['fat', 'fuck', 'fat', 'asshole']
Legless Boy	5	0	I don't have legs.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Yeah, well you got skinny arms!  'Scuse me. Move it.	[]
Cartman	94	1	And so to go through all that, your honor, to go through all the shame and daily ridicule, and then not to be able to take a simple shit at Best Buy?  At Besty Buy I'm sorry.  To be told by some Best Buy manager that your mobility scooter can't fit in his bathroom?  Oh God, excuse me! It's just so belittling, you know? All I wanted to do was take a dump, your honor. After all I've been through, can't I just take a dump at Best Buy?	['shit']
Anchor	42	1	More lawsuits today as people on mobility scooters claim they have nowhere to poo. Property owners are being ordered to modify their bathrooms, costing taxpayers millions. Opponents of the measure are expressing their outrage by engaging in the act of Rascal tipping.	['poo']
Obese Man 2	9	0	Stop it you kids! sto- Oop- Owww. Weak! Weak!	[]
Anchor	54	2	The government warns that Rascal tipping can be dangerous, and may lead to fat people shitting their pants as they kick and scream on the floor. To counter the crisis, the Department of Health has called for $25 million in aid, so that all mobility scooters can be fitted with a tip assist device.	['fat', 'shitting']
Cartman	10	0	Oh yeah, it's nice. Yeah, that works pretty well.	[]
Kyle	7	0	You have got to be kidding me!	[]
Cartman	2	0	What, Kyle?!	[]
Kyle	19	1	We should not be wasting time and money making sure Cartman's fat scooter can't be tipped over!	['fat']
Cartman	20	0	You condone Rascal-tipping, Kyle?! Do you know that all over our country people in mobility scooters are being victimized?!	[]
Kyle	10	1	So get off your fucking scooters and pick them up!	['fucking']
Cartman	154	2	Oh! Oh, did you hear him?!  This is exactly what Adele is talking about!  Our culture celebrates anorexia and tries to make us ashamed if we don't have slim stomachs and perky little tits like Kyle!  Well I for one am gonna stop feeling ashamed just because Kyle throws up in the bathroom six times a day  to make sure he looks good on his magazine covers!  You should be ashamed of YOURself, Kyle! eating your latkes and gefilte fish and then putting your fingers down your throat because society tells you how to look!  I'm not feeling shamed anymore! From now on, I'm gonna shop sitting down and skip to the front of the lines with my head held high! Just because someone needs a mobility scooter doesn't mean they're an ignorant piece of white trash, Kyle! I may be fat, but I'm not Honey Boo Boo!	['tits', 'fat']
Kyle	5	0	Who's Honey Boo Boo?	[]
Stan	8	0	Dude, you've never seen Honey Boo Boo?	[]
Honey Boo Boo	27	3	My name's Honey Boo Boo and I'm a beauty queen, bitches.  I'm fat as a whale and I don't give two shits, girl!	['bitches', 'fat', 'shits']
Mama	16	0	Her favorite foods are sketti and butter, and she likes drinkin' Red Bull and Mountain Dew.	[]
Honey Boo Boo	13	0	I'm only six and I've already had three heart attacks, girlfriend!	[]
Mama	30	0	Come on! Come on now, Boo Boo!  Now get up and wave to them judges!  We ain't got no shame about our weight, 'cause our weight makes us sassy.	[]
Kyle	23	0	Jesus, dude. W-w-what happened? It's like, something's lowered the bar to the point that nobody feels any shame anymore.	[]
Stan	13	0	Well, dude, it's not like the bar is this actual, physical thing.	[]
James Cameron	5	0	This is it! Throttle down!	[]
A crewman	2	0	Throttle down!	[]
Crewman 1	26	0	Mr. Cameron, you don't have to do this! Why don't you just go back to your house in Malibu? Go work on another movie?	[]
James Cameron	12	0	I have to do this! I have to try and raise it!	[]
Crewman 1	10	0	The bar isn't something that actually lowers, Mr. Cameron.	[]
James Cameron	57	1	Then how do you explain all the fat people on mobility scooters?  How do YOU account for... Honey Boo Boo? The bar has been lowered to depths we can't even fathom. If anyone can go down there and raise it back, it's ME.  Let her go!  UV lights on. Pressure system is normal. Music, on.	['fat']
Singers	25	0	His name is James (James) Cameron, the bravest pioneer. No budget too steep no sea too deep Who's that? It's him! James Cameron.	[]
James Cameron	11	0	Systems are normal. You guys hearing the song okay up there?	[]
Singers	7	0	James (James) Cameron, explorer of the sea	[]
Crewman 1	6	0	Yes, James, we hear the song.	[]
James Cameron	20	0	Descending to one thousand feet. I don't see the bar yet. Looks like it must have sunk pretty low.	[]
Singers	17	0	With a dying thirst to be the first. Could it be? Yeah it's him. James Cameron.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Come on, hurry it up in there!	[]
Cartman	21	1	Oh yeah, that's good. That's accessible now. Cool, let me try to take a shit in this real quick.	['shit']
Kyle	26	1	This has gone far enough!  How can we make people see the difference between being sensitive to obesity and letting fat people walk all over us?!	['fat']
Token	9	0	Yeah, what we need is something to raise awareness.	[]
Kyle	8	0	Yeah! We've gotta raise people's awareness!	[]
Token	21	1	Something like... a documentary. You know, follow Cartman around, with a video camera, and then get all his bullshit on television.	['bullshit']
Kyle	6	0	Yeah! g'uh... A, a documentary?	[]
Token	29	0	At least then we'd be voicing our concern. I mean, if you think about it, we should feel some shame for... complaining about it and not doing anything.	[]
Kyle	9	0	You, I gu-I guess you're kinda right.	[]
Token	31	0	Hey, tell you what: if you wanna follow Cartman around, and get a video of him, I'll pay to make it into a documentary, and get it on the air.	[]
Kyle	11	0	Really? Thanks, dude! I'm gonna go get a video camera!	[]
Craig	21	0	Hey Token. If you're gonna get Kyle to video that stuff for you, you should probably tell him the truth.	[]
Token	18	0	He doesn't need to know the truth. Kyle will get what he wants, and so will I.	[]
Kyle	62	0	Ladies and gentlemen, we have an epidemic in our country. Obesity is costing taxpayers millions, and some are taking advantage of a system that is flawed. Over the past several days I have filmed such a case, and the shocking video has been edited by my partner, Token. It is our hope that this film will cast light on a serious issue.	[]
Token	24	2	He's chubby,  he's filthy , and he's just a little bit nuts.  Here he is, America's newest sweetheart, Fatty Doo Doo!	['nuts', 'fatty']
Kyle	3	1	Fatty Doo Doo?	['fatty']
Randy Newman	20	2	Who's that scootin' on a scooter? Fatty Doo Doo Who's got doodoo like a fatty scoop de do?	['fatty', 'fatty']
Kyle	1	0	What?	[]
Randy Newman	40	3	Nobody scoots a fatty doo like you do. Scatty foo foo Patty poo poo White president, black president, I don't care. Just scoop me up some doodoo and I'll be right there. I. Only. Know. Five. Chords. Six-	['fatty', 'poo', 'poo']
Token	2	0	Come in.	[]
Kyle	4	0	What have you done?	[]
Token	7	0	I helped you make a documentary, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	14	0	When we said documentary, I thought we meant 60 Minutes, not Honey Boo Boo!	[]
Token	9	0	Kyle, Kyle, I'm trying to make compelling television.	[]
Kyle	48	1	You got Randy Newman to do the theme song. You're not trying that hard. Token, you're a good kid. How can you sit there and collect money on a show that's about a, about a fat child killing himself?? Where's your sense of shame??	['fat']
Token	57	1	I can remember... exactly where I was... the first time I saw Honey Boo Boo. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. A shameful, fat family eating white trash food to their death. And then I saw what network it was on: The Learning Channel.  If they can feel okay about that, why can't I?	['fat']
Kyle	33	0	When the bar gets lowered, Token, we all pay the price. What if Honey Boo Boo was a little black girl? Being fattened up by her mom and talking about grits and hominy?	[]
Token	33	0	But she's not black, Kyle. She's white.  The bar is determined by society, Kyle. And it's not something that can just be raised up.  Not by us, or anyone else.	[]
James Cameron	4	0	You guys seeing this?!	[]
Crewman 1	5	0	Yes, we see, Mr. Cameron.	[]
James Cameron	66	0	This is where the bar was just a few years ago. It was lowered here when President Clinton got a blow job in the oval office. And suddenly men who were just getting blow jobs in alleyways thought they weren't all that bad. But clearly something else has lowered the bar even more! I must go deeper! We're in the pipe, five by five.	[]
Kyle	57	0	I just don't know what to do. I mean, I hate Cartman with all my heart, but I can't stop feeling ashamed for taking advantage of him. But should I feel ashamed? Oh, whatever lowered the bar is not my fault. So if I kind of go with it, is it really unfair to Cartman?	[]
Stan	13	0	I guess not, but... What is it exactly you're trying to do?	[]
Kyle	12	0	Just, you know, make some money off him. Like Honey Boo boo.	[]
Stan	4	0	Dude! Dude, not cool!	[]
Kyle	1	0	What?	[]
Stan	13	0	Haven't you heard what happened? Honey Boo Boo's heart gave out.	[]
Kyle	4	0	What? Oh my God.	[]
Stan	6	0	Yeah dude. It's really serious.	[]
Mama	36	0	Well, the doctor said Honey Boo Boo needs a heart transplant. They're gonna do a surgery and put a pig heart in her, so, we're going to the ranch to pick out a hog.	[]
Honey Boo Boo	6	0	I'mm gettin' a piiig heaaart.	[]
Mama	26	0	Honey Boo Boo is gonna do pageants with a pig heart, we wanna pick a hog that has pizzazz and knows how to work it, girl!	[]
Honey Boo Boo	4	0	I waunt that one!	[]
Farmer	7	0	This one here?  You want this one??	[]
Honey Boo Boo	20	0	Yeah! No wait! That pig over there gave me the evil eye! I wuant that one! I waunt  that one!	[]
Farmer	10	0	This one?  this one right here?? Ya waunt this one??	[]
Honey Boo Boo	11	0	I want that one's heart! It looked at me funny!	[]
Mama	38	0	We've been in the OR about two hours already. I just hope when she does her pageants the judges don't take away points 'cause she's got a pig heart.  Honey Boo Boo!  Honey BOO BOO!	[]
Honey Boo Boo	1	0	What?!	[]
Mama	13	0	What you gonna tell them judges if they ask you about your heart?	[]
Honey Boo Boo	12	0	I'm gonna tell them my heart is sweeter than bacon, child!	[]
Mama	22	0	Who waunts sketti and butter?  She got a pig heart an' now she thinks she's a pachyderm. Show 'em your scar!	[]
Honey Boo Boo	16	0	This is myyy scaaar 'cause I got a pig heart. My scar makes me sassy, child!	[]
James Cameron	45	0	S. S. Cameron? This is James Cameron. I am now at... 16,000 feet. You should see the cold darkness of it all. The isolation and yet awwwe of the sea's magnitude. I have now sunk deeper than any human has ever been before!	[]
Randy Newman	15	0	We are here in the ocean depths goin' deep deep deep-  Oh hey James Cameron.	[]
James Cameron	3	1	What the fuck?!	['fuck']
Randy Newman	13	0	I've been divin' in the deep and I'm feelin' so cheap.	[]
James Cameron	13	1	You son of a bitch Newman! How did you beat me down here!	['bitch']
Randy Newman	25	0	I don't want anyone raisin' the bar, 'cause nobody'll hire me! Deep deep deep in the ocean. Ohhh, come on. Fight me, Cameron.	[]
James Cameron	12	2	Alright, you son of a bitch! I'll take you to hell!	['bitch', 'hell']
Cartman	16	0	It is a violation of my civil rights, Token, and you should be ashamed of yourself!	[]
Kyle	14	0	I'm sorry Token, I had to tell him. His life is in danger.	[]
Cartman	41	0	Making money off of people's handicaps! Well Token, I would like you to meet my lawyer!  As soon as he gets in here he will be handing you a cease and desist order! That show is not going to air!	[]
Token	5	0	It actually aired last night.	[]
Kyle	7	0	You found a network to buy it?	[]
Token	21	0	Yeah, but don't worry. It didn't do so good. We got killed in the ratings by Honey Boo Boo.	[]
Cartman	12	2	What? That little bitch beat me in the ratings?! Oh HELL NO!	['bitch', 'hell']
Token	15	0	Well it was only our first show of the season, so you really can't-	[]
Cartman	21	2	I don't give a shit, dude! Nobody beats my ratings! Get me a plane ticket! That bitch is going down!	['shit', 'bitch']
Announcer	17	0	We welcome you to the First Lady's Symposium on Obesity, with your keynote speaker, Michelle Obama.	[]
Michelle Obama	70	3	Our country is in the midst of an epidemic. Recently a very big conflict was brought to my attention.  A conflict that illustrates without a doubt what should be our nation's number one priority. What will we do as a country? I cannot give you any easy answers. But what I can give you, is what we've all been waiting for! Honey Boo Boo versus Fatty Poo Poo!	['fatty', 'poo', 'poo']
Cartman	9	1	You're goin' down, bitch!  Nobody takes my ratings!	['bitch']
Token	6	1	That's good, Fatty, get pissed!	['fatty']
Cartman	3	0	I'm pissed!	[]
Token	2	1	Yeah, Fatty!	['fatty']

Crewman 2	5	0	You think he's dead?	[]
Crewman 3	3	0	I hope so.	[]
James Cameron	37	1	S.S. Cameron! This is James Cameron! I've found it! My God I found the bar!  Divert all power to sub systems! Two percent oxygen left!  The bar is too heavy! Aaaaagh! Come on you bitch!	['bitch']
Crewman 4	5	1	Well I'll be damned.	['damned']
Stan	3	0	Dude, you okay?	[]
Kyle	70	1	I've been thinking, how did shamelessness get to this?  Did it start with fat people on scooters? Or did the bar get lowered way before that? And then I started thinking, maybe it was us.  I don't know, but maybe somehow, we lowered the bar, a long time ago.  And now we're all sittin' here in the stink of it all.  There's no going back, Stan.	['fat']
Man 2	18	0	Rrrgh it's like, I can't explain it. I just suddenly feel like this isn't right.	[]
Man 3	14	0	I don't know why we were watchin' that garbage in the first place.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Huh?	[]
Aide	10	0	Ms. Obama, are you, uh, ma'am? Are you okay?	[]
Michelle Obama	23	0	Something's wrong. This... This is all wrong!  Stop! Everyone! What are we doing?! How can you let this happen to your daughter?!	[]
Mama	17	0	I don't know, I... How did I let myself go like this? What have I done??	[]
Man 4	10	1	When did we devolve into watching fat kids sketti wrestling?	['fat']
Michelle Obama	28	0	We need to realize obesity is an epidemic. But it's not a disease. From now on I'm going to dedicate this administration to FIGHTING childhood obesity!	[]
Cartman	4	2	Oh! You fucking bitch!	['fucking', 'bitch']

Kyle	12	0	I don't know. I think... we've been given another chance.	[]
Crewman 5	7	0	Hey Cameron, we can't believe it.	[]
James Cameron	12	0	We're done here! Set course for the set of Avatar 2	[]
Crewman 6	24	0	Mr. Cameron.  People should know. How you saved us all? How you raised the bar? How will they know what a hero you are?	[]
James Cameron	25	0	James Cameron doesn't do what James Cameron does for James Cameron.  James Cameron does what James Cameron does because James Cameron is... James Cameron.	[]
Singers	25	0	His name is James (James) Cameron, the bravest pioneer. No budget too steep no sea too deep Who's that? It's him! James Cameron.	[]
