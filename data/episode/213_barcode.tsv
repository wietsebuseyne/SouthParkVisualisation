Butters	35	0	And so then, and so then it turns out the Terminator secretly had a kid, ten years ago. Meaning Terminator could be his own father. And then Skeletor gets angry and wants to fight him.	[]
Kyle	13	0	...No, dude, that's not the trailer for Terminator 5, that really happened.	[]
Butters	3	0	Skeletor is real??	[]

Butters	2	0	Hey Eric.	[]
Cartman	21	1	I AM SO SICK OF THIS FUCKING SCHOOOOOL!  This stupid school and its stupid principal have gone to far this time!!	['fucking']
Kyle	6	0	You get in trouble again, Cartman?	[]
Cartman	31	1	No, I didn't do a damn thing! Nothing! I told you, this school is a DEN of SNAKES! You're not gonna believe what they did this time, you guys!	['damn']
Stan	9	0	Dude we're, we're just trying to eat.	[]
Cartman	37	0	Oh, you think I'm overreacting again, hun?! No! Not this time!  The school has gone too far, and it affects each and every one of you!  You remember the school physical we all took last week?!	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Cartman	19	1	Well, the school put the sizes of all our penises up on a big chart in the school hallway!	['penises']
Kyle	4	0	No they didn't.	[]
Cartman	5	1	Yeah they fucking did Kyle!	['fucking']
Stan	12	0	Dude, why would the school put up the sizes of our wieners?	[]
Cartman	27	2	Because they don't fucking care! I've told you this! They don't give a shit about the students, and they live to make us miserable!	['fucking', 'shit']
Kyle	6	0	That doesn't make any sense.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Go look for yourselves!!	[]
Cartman	8	1	There, you see?! Can you fucking believe it?!	['fucking']
Butters	7	0	Is that really all our wiener sizes?	[]
Cartman	33	0	Yeah, dude, look at it! It says right there: Eric Cartman, 1.2 inches!  Why would they tell everybody that?! They wanna measure my wiener?! Fine! But don't put me on blast!	[]
Craig	10	0	Craig Tucker, 2.4 inches. Yeah, that's about right.	[]
Butters	8	0	Butters Stotch, 2.2 inches. Is that good?	[]
Kyle	7	0	How big do they say mine is?	[]
Principal Victoria	17	0	I told you the students would be interested in how much they grew since their last physical.	[]
Mr. Mackey	11	0	You're right. They, they really seem into it, m'kay.	[]
Stan	14	0	Wait, it says mine's only 2.1 inches. That doesn't seem right.	[]
Cartman	22	2	No shit, Sherlock! My dick isn't 1.4 inches either! It ISN'T! This is another conspiracy by the school faculty!	['shit', 'dick']
Butters	2	0	A conspiracy?	[]
Cartman	32	0	They're trying to stir up some big thing again, get all the girls all heated up - freaking out - over which boy has the biggest schlong! This has to be dealt with!	[]
Kyle	13	0	Well everyone has already seen it; nothing we can do about it now.	[]
Cartman	32	0	Oh, there's something we can do about it alright! If they're gonna put us on blast, they're at least gonna get the numbers right! We are going to remeasure!!	[]
Cartman	19	0	Alright. Clyde Donovan, 2.3 inches.  You see, witnesses? That's .2 inches more than what the school said.	[]
Clyde	1	0	Alright.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Nice one, Clyde. Alright, next?  Whip it out, Butters.	[]
Butters	8	0	Whoa, it's a little chilly in here.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Alright Butters, let's see what you got going down there.	[]
Butters	15	0	Hey wait, the cold is making it shrink some. Where're you going, little feller?	[]
Cartman	20	0	Butters, I don't have time fot this! I can't wait if your wiener is pulling a Scared Turtle.	[]
Butters	15	0	Hang on, he's coming back out. There he is. Who's a little guy?	[]
Cartman	14	0	Alright Butters, looks like we haaave 2.- wow, 2.4 inches. Really nice, Butters.	[]
Butters	6	0	I'm hung like a horse!	[]
Cartman	11	0	Alright, that's everybody. Let's go post these numbers.  What?	[]
Kyle	5	0	Didn't you forget something?	[]
Cartman	2	0	What, Kyle?	[]
Kyle	8	0	You measured everyone's wiener except for yours.	[]
Cartman	13	0	I measured mine this morning. See? It's right here at the top.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Thirteen point seven inches?	[]
Cartman	5	0	Yeah, it's pretty good.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Your wiener is not 13 inches long!	[]
Stan	12	0	You made everyone else get measured with witnesses; you have to too.	[]
Cartman	20	2	Well what are you guys going to do?! Use a tape measure and measure my penis yourselves?! Are you homos?!	['penis', 'homos']
Stan	8	0	You just did that to everybody in class!	[]
Cartman	5	0	Okay, fine! Whatever! Go ahead!	[]
Stan	12	0	Yeah. That's good. A little higher on Craig's side.  Yeup.	[]
Millie	4	1	Actual boys' penis sizes?	['penis']
Nelly	1	0	Gross!	[]
Cartman	75	0	There, you see? My wiener isn't 1.2 inches, it's 1.4!  What, Red?! You're all freaking out because my wiener is smaller than the other guys'?! I don't care!  Clearly I'm very happy with the size of my wiener, or else why would I have called for a new measurement, and for this poster to be put up at all?! Don't forget that this was all my idea!	[]
Principal Victoria	8	0	Eric Cartman to the principal's office immediately.	[]
Cartman	2	1	Oh, Goddamnit!	['goddamnit']
Cartman	8	0	Let me guess: I'm in trouble again!	[]
Principal Victoria	5	0	You're darn right, Eric!	[]
Cartman	2	0	For what?!	[]
Principal Victoria	19	1	Why did you measure all the boy students' penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?!	['penis']
Cartman	16	1	Why did YOU measure our penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?!	['penis']
Principal Victoria	1	0	What?	[]
Cartman	27	1	I don't care if Obama IS President! You don't go around putting little boys on blast, telling the whole world the length of their DICKS!	['dicks']
Principal Victoria	13	0	Wait. Are you talking about the numbers we published Tuesday from the physical?	[]
Cartman	39	2	You're damn right! One point two inches! I'll have you know that my penis is a respectable 1.4 inches! Maybe it's still the smallest in school, but it's .2 inches bogger than you said!!	['damn', 'penis']
Principal Victoria	8	0	The numbers we put up were height differentials.	[]
Cartman	1	0	What?	[]
Principal Victoria	27	0	We thought it would be fun to put up how much each student has grown in height since their physical last year. You grew 1.2 inches.	[]
Cartman	6	1	Those weren't our dick sizes?	['dick']
Principal Victoria	11	0	Why would we publish the lengths of our students' private parts?	[]
Cartman	7	0	I don't know! Why would you?!	[]
Principal Victoria	3	0	We didn't!	[]
Cartman	17	1	Aw crap! You mean everyone knows my wiener is smaller than everyone else's because of me?!	['crap']
Principal Victoria	37	0	This is exactly the kind of thing we are always talking about, Eric. You get angry about something, you don't think, and you cause bad things to happen. This time you've done it to yourself!	[]
Cartman	15	0	Oh God. Why couldn't I have just taken a minute to think about it?	[]
Principal Victoria	7	0	Because you have an anger problem, Eric!	[]
Cartman	6	1	Fuck you! No I don't!	['fuck']
Doctor	26	0	What we need to figure out here is, are we dealing with maybe a little bipolarism? Some rage addiction? It could be a lot of things.	[]
Liane	13	0	My little sunshine has a temper sometimes, but he's not all bad.	[]
Doctor	33	0	Let's try a little experiment. I wanna see maybe what kind of things... trigger you, Eric. Okay? How do you think you would react if I said some negative things about you?	[]
Cartman	6	0	Honestly, I wouldn't really care.	[]
Doctor	144	14	What if I were to tell you that I think you're fat? I think you're a fat little boy. I think you're waaaaay too fat for your age. Does that make you feel any anger? Huh, fatty? Jelly-belly? You got jelly in your belly you little fat fuck? You get a little flash of anger when someone tells you you've got tits like a 40-year-old woman? Fat boy?!  Huh?! You like that, shitty-titty jelly-belly?!  Oh yeah, he's a big boy!! Get that fatty some mud flaps for his ass!! Big old jiggly fatty butt!!  ...Huh. Well, I just don't see it, Ms. Cartman. Your son doesn't seem to be triggered by anger at all. In fact, I'd say he's one of the more even-tempered children I've ever seen.

Receptionist	13	0	Sorry Doctor, your wife's on the phone? Says it's an emergency.	[]
Doctor	68	0	Excuse me.  Carol, what? ...Whoa, calm down honey. What do you mean? Web chat with wha-? What 14-year-old girl? Carol, I would ne-  No I don't have a criminal record. Who would- Who is Mitch Conner?! There can't be an official police report, honey, there's no- No no, Carol, put down the gun, swee- uh sweetie, come on, put down the  Carol? Carol!	[]
Cartman	8	1	I'm not fat! I'm big-boned!	['fat']
Principal Victoria	33	1	Thank you for coming, parents. We called you in because we've had a little incident at the school. The fourth grade boys measured their penises and posted results in the school hallway.	['penises']
Randy	2	0	Oh dear.	[]
Principal Victoria	17	0	Now, we realize this issue can have a troubling effect that can get blown out of proportion.	[]
Randy	10	1	Did they measure from the base or from the balls?	['balls']
Mrs. Stevens	9	0	How does the school let things like this happen??	[]
Principal Victoria	27	0	Now now, boys' fascination with their genitalia is a natural thing. We... simply need to find a way to help the students understand what they've done.	[]
Randy	12	0	I'm a scientist. I think it's best I handle this.	[]
Randy	58	0	Hello students, my name is Dr. Marsh, and I'm gonna talk to you a little bit about what happened at the school yesterday. How do a man and a woman... make a baby? Anybody? A man and woman, what do they do to make a baby? How about the little girl in the brown coat? Yeah you.	[]
Girl with Brown Coat	3	1	They have sex?	['sex']
Randy	107	5	Good! The man puts his penis  Okay? Into the woman's vagina.  Okay now, sometimes, a man can feel like how long his penis is, is actually important. But is it? When you boys measure your penis length, the truth is it doesn't really matter. What does matter is  Length times diameter plus weight over girth divided by angle of the tip squared, okay? When we're talking about penis size, we can't just use a tape measure. We need a scale  and...  a protractor as well.  Let's look at it on the graph here..  Follow along with me on your study sheets, kids.	['penis', 'vagina', 'penis', 'penis', 'penis']
Doctor	17	0	I want to congratulate all of you for making the effort to come to anger management class.	[]
Bodybuilder	12	0	We didn't make any effort, we didn't have a choice!	[]
Tea Bag Participant	4	1	Yeah! This is bullshit!	['bullshit']
Doctor	26	0	Together, we're gonna learn what makes us angry, okay? And how to better deal with it so we don't get ourselves into trouble anymore.	[]
Michael	8	1	So lame! Why doesn't everyone just die?!	['lame']
Tuong Lu Kim	31	4	Rook! Ifuh somebody ordereduh shitty beef, anduh complain because they say they ordereduh shitty shrimp, It's notuh my fault he gets the shitty chicken poured all over hisuh fucking head!	['shitty', 'shitty', 'shitty', 'fucking']
Tea Bag Participant	36	1	We have good reason to be angry! This country is going to shit! We have exactly twelve days before the oil is gone, and our president is a socialist who wasn't even born in America!	['shit']
Doctor	20	0	Right. See, what we all need to do is chaaannel our various reasons for anger, and learn to control it.	[]
Wigger	31	5	Man, this shit wack, manh. I just see all this shit fummah. I'm in the stands like pozze no fuckin' good manh. Bitch be callin me tappin that shit, man.	['shit', 'shit', 'fuckin', 'bitch', 'shit']
Cartman	6	1	Why the fuck am I here?!	['fuck']
Doctor	16	0	Well, Eric, because I know you want to... control your anger and become a better person.	[]
Cartman	10	1	Are you saying I have problems like these fucking people?!	['fucking']
Doctor	32	0	NO No, I'm not saying that, at all. Please I, I'm just saying how a-, amazing you are for wanting to... l-lessen some of your more... less awesome attributes.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Oh, that's cool.	[]
Randy	52	2	And so, by dividing the weight and the girth of the penis by the angle or the- what do we call it again? The yaw? The yaw of the shaft? What we finally get is the adjusted penis size, or, T.M.I. Any questions so far? Yes, little girl over there.	['penis', 'penis']
Girl with Blue Vest	4	1	What's a penis?	['penis']
Randy	60	1	...Ah, good question. Ahh, the penis is the thing we're talking about that boys have that we're... measuring.  Okay any other questions? Okay, so then let's move on to the example on your study sheet. How about you? Could you read the first example for the class?  Example 1, young lady. Please read the problem out loud	['penis']
Riley	13	1	Example 1: Randy has a penis that is 4.4 inches in length.	['penis']
Randy	4	0	Four point four inches...	[]
Riley	21	1	Its angle is 32 degrees. Its flaccid girth is one inch in diameter. His balls are seven centimeters from the base.	['balls']
Randy	2	0	Seven centimeters...	[]
Riley	21	2	Randy notes that the drift of his penis is four centimeters to penis right, and its dead weight is .5 kilograms.	['penis', 'penis']
Randy	89	1	Great! And so divide by the 17. carry the 1, and we can see that Randy's adjusted penis size, or T.M.I., is... 6.3 inches. Do we got that? Randy's length is 4.4 inches, but his adjusted length is 6.3. So how does our example person Randy compare to others on the T.M.I. scale? By referring again to the T.M.I. chart, we see that a T.M.I. of 6.3 is .8 inches more than the national average.	['penis']
Doctor	29	0	Okay, what we're going to do now is get to the root of all your anger. Daniel, could you stand up please?  What makes you the angriest, Daniel?	[]
Daniel	4	1	Stupid-ass blind liberals!	['ass']
Doctor	22	1	Okay, great. Chase, could you stand up and pretend to be a stupid-ass blind liberal?  And what makes you angriest, Chase?	['ass']
Chase	3	1	Scrawny-ass sissies!	['ass']
Doctor	20	1	Okay, Daniel's a scrawny-ass sissy, he just cut in front of you in line at the bank. Go!	['ass']
Chase	11	1	Hey! What, do you think I got a small dick?! Huh?!	['dick']
Daniel	16	2	Huh I don't have a small penis! My wife thinks my penis is perfectly fine!	['penis', 'penis']
Doctor	30	0	...Okay. Uh, why don't we uh do some roleplaying now with Wayne D, who gets angriest at his mom.  Gretchen, can you play Wayne D's mom for us?	[]
Wayne D	26	3	Yo, bitch! You think you bad? Just 'cause you're a mom don't mean I can't put a cap in your ass, bitch, mang!	['bitch', 'ass', 'bitch']
Gretchen	16	1	I may be female on the outside, but I still have a bigger penis than you!	['penis']
Wayne D	19	1	I don't have a small penis! Don't say that, it isn't true! It isn't true!	['penis']
Tuong Lu Kim	13	1	That's enough! I've beem sick of everyone talk aboutuh penis shize!	['penis']
Daniel	9	0	Yeah, it doesn't matter! It doesn't matter!	[]
Doctor	10	1	Does... everyone here have an issue with their penis size?	['penis']
Chase	1	0	No.	[]
Gretchen	1	0	No.	[]
Tuong Lu Kim	2	0	Not me.	[]
Daniel	1	0	Nnnooo.	[]
Wayne D	7	1	No, my, my shit be packing, manh.	['shit']
Cartman	6	1	My penis is 13 inches long.	['penis']
Doctor	1	0	Hmmm.	[]
Guest Speaker	40	1	Kids, my name is Rebecca Turnod, and I'm an actual doctor of human sexuality and behavior. Unfortunately you have been taught some very wrong ideas in the past couple of days, and I am here to set things straight.	['sexuality']
Wendy	2	0	Thank God.	[]
Ms. Turnod	43	0	I want you to try and forget these wild theories and understand that all that's important when it comes to a man and a woman making love is actually  Length times girth over angle of the shaft divided by mass over width-	[]
Randy	4	1	Vou DAMN N MONTAIRE	['damn']
Doctor	14	0	We all want to welcome our new member, Randy. Say hi to everyone, Randy.	[]
Randy	6	0	Aw, suck it! All o'ya!	[]
Doctor	24	0	Now, we've all been trying to channel our anger in more constructive ways, Randy. Why don't you share what's bothering you?	[]
Randy	19	1	You just don't go around changing math! Who the hell is this chick surgeon general appointed by Obama?!	['hell']
Daniel	4	1	Goddamn right! Socialist fascist!	['goddamn']
Randy	10	0	Power to the people! Burn it down! Burn it down!!	[]
Doctor	14	0	Mr. Marsh, this is what we're here to try and work on, okay?	[]
Randy	9	2	No dude, fuck you! We're burnin' this shit!	['fuck', 'shit']
Doctor	14	0	If you take a minute to think about your anger, and give-  whoa! Whoawhoawhoa!	[]
Randy	1	0	Yeeaahh!	[]

Customer	10	0	Yes, I've got some birthday presents I need shipped.	[]
Clerk	7	0	Alrighty, let's see what kind of-	[]
Randy	3	0	Burn it down!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Burn it down, dude!	[]
Randy	16	0	Let's see how the American government likes it when we shut down their Federal Express!	[]
Field Reporter	39	0	Tom, I'm standing outside the FedEx in Fairplay, Colorado, where a radical political group has taken several people hostage. They call themselves the pissed-off and angry party. And they allowed me to speak with them moments ago.	[]
Randy	26	0	This is a call to all angry people! We've had enough! We're gonna hit the government where it hurts! Right in the Federal Express!	[]
Field Reporter	6	0	What exactly are you angry about?	[]
Randy	15	0	We're angry about this stupid liberal government and fascist lies, media- control, and the-	[]
Cartman	2	1	The Jews!	['jews']
Randy	11	1	Yeah, Jews! And all this stuff that the government's doing!	['jews']
Field Reporter	12	0	You've got a lot of people scared. What are your demands?	[]
Randy	12	0	Well first of all, we want that surgeon general to step down!	[]
Chase	1	0	Yeeaahh!	[]
Randy	3	0	And we want-	[]
Daniel	10	0	And we want to see Obama's REAL birth certificate!	[]
Randy	12	0	Yeah, we want to see Obama's REAL birth certificate! And um,	[]
Wayne D	14	1	And my mom gotta stop trippin', manh. Bitch be trippin' all the time, manh.	['bitch']
Randy	25	1	Yeah, we want our moms to stup trippin', man! 'Cause the bitches be trippin' all the time! And I think that- uhh,  is that it?	['bitches']
Cartman	4	1	No, and fuck Kyle!	['fuck']
Randy	37	2	Oh yeah, and fuck Kyle! Surgeon general's resignation, Obama's real birth certificate, moms to stop trippin', and fuck Kyle! You got that?! Or else we're gonna bring the Federal Express to a grinding halt!	['fuck', 'fuck']
Field Reporter	17	0	Does it bother you that the Federal Express is not affiliated at all with the Federal Government?	[]
Randy	8	1	No. No, that doesn't matter!  Fuck, really?!	['fuck']
Linda	5	0	Butters, what are you doing?	[]
Butters	36	1	Homework! I just don't get it! That is the fourth time I've calculated, and it's below average! I thought I was hung, but according to my T.M.I., I have a micropenis!	['micropenis']
Linda	4	0	Your T.M.I.?	[]
Butters	17	0	I don't understand it! An' I'm startin'- uhh, I'm starting to feel angry! Rawr!	[]
Linda	5	0	Butters, put your clothes on.	[]
Butters	61	0	Oh what's the point, Mom?! What's the point of life anyway?! All you do is yell at me! And the government... wuh, which is led by fascists, and everyone's a Justin Bieber wannabe. I wanna go and drive a Hummer, that's what I wanna do! I wanna drive a car that goes, that goes rawr rawr rawrawrawr!	[]
Linda	14	1	Butters, what does driving a car have to do with your penis being small?	['penis']
Driver 1	17	0	Hey, everyone who's pissed off and angry is rallying to take down America! Join the fight!	[]
Driver 2	16	0	We're gonna take down the Federal Expresses, the American Apparels, and the American Furniture Warehouse!	[]
Driver 3	9	0	We're fed up and we've had enough!	[]
Aide 1	19	0	Surgeon general, twelve more FedExes have been taken over; the Pissed Off and Angry Party is gaining more support!	[]
Aide 2	21	0	They've shut down American Airlines and American Apparels all over the country. We have to ask you to step down.	[]
Rebecca Turnod	13	0	Are you seriously saying we're going to give in to their demands?	[]
Aide 2	22	1	They're all really angry. We have to make them stop. Is the team standing by to fuck that little boy Kyle?	['fuck']
Aide 3	5	0	Team is standing by, sir.	[]
Doctor	7	0	'Scuse me. Excuse me, let me through.	[]
Rebecca Turnod	3	0	Who is this?	[]
Doctor	68	1	Surgeon general, I believe I know why this is happening. I have found a direct correlation between the anger, and T.M.I.  Anger equals length times width over mass squared minus angle of the shaft plus yaw.  Look, we all get angry, but when someone is consistently angry or always finding new reasons to be angry, it means they have a very very very very small dick.	['dick']
Rebecca Turnod	31	0	Your theory is fine, doctor, but it doesn't matter. The T.M.I. equation is true solid science, which cannot be changed. There's nothing we can do about it.	[]
Doctor	6	0	Isn't there? Isn't... there?	[]
Daniel	14	1	We've waited long enough, Randy! Let's start killin' these sons of bitches!	['bitches']
Woman	2	0	No, please!	[]
Cartman	11	0	Yeah, dude, they aren't gonna give us what we want!	[]
Wayne D	20	1	Yo let's cap these bitches, manh! Let's cap an leave em at the back of the building, manh!	['bitches']
Michael	5	0	Hey, come over here. Look.	[]
Announcer	12	0	We interrupt this newscast for an important message from the surgeon general.	[]
Rebecca Turnod	35	0	Fellow Americans, as you all know, the T.M.I. scale was implemented long ago to assure that each and every American could accurately measure their junk. The established equation is a hundred percent accurate.	[]
Randy	1	0	Rrrr!	[]
Daniel	1	0	Shhh.	[]
Rebecca Turnod	43	1	However, due to recently collected data, we are making one change.  The national average for penis length is now officially moved, from 6 inches to 1.5 inches.  Anyone with a T.M.I. of over 1.5 inches is considered above average.	['penis']
Randy	34	0	The winds of change are blowin'. There's excitement in the air. Can you feel it? It's electric and magical. The happy train's on track. 'Cause America is BACK! Woohoo! Come on!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Wait, what?	[]
Randy	6	0	America is back! America is back!	[]
Cartman	11	0	Wait! According to that scale, I still have a small wiener!	[]
Randy	14	0	We're back, we're back, we're back back back! America is back!	[]
Cartman	5	1	I'm still fucking angry!	['fucking']
Randy	22	0	Back and we're back and we're back! We're so back, we're so back back back back back back!	[]
