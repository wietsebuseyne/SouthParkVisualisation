Stephen Abootman	11	0	Oh, negotiating hardball, are we?! What about all that Internet money?!	[]
Kyle	2	0	The Internet?	[]
Stephen Abootman	61	2	You listen to me, friend!  You'd better figure out a way to get us our fair amount of money, and until you come back with a solid fair number, I'm finished talking to you, you slimy corporate dickhead!  Don't worry, don't worry. This is how negotiating works. This is good. We've got 'em by the balls.	['dickhead', 'balls']

Cartman	6	0	There's more people viewing it!	[]
Stan	4	0	This is going great!	[]
Kyle	10	0	Don't worry, Ike! The strike will be over soon!	[]

Tron Guy	13	1	Hey, I know you. You're the What What (In My Asshole) kid.	['asshole']
Butters	6	1	What What (In The Butt), sir.	['butt']
Stan	9	0	It's Tron Guy. I saw him on YouToob.	[]
Tron Guy	15	0	Yeah, sure. All the biggest Internet stars are here. You remember, of course, Numa Numa.	[]
Numa Numa	9	0	Ma-iyahi Ma-iyahu Ma-iyaho, Ma-iyaha ha	[]

Kyle	4	0	Okay, we did it.	[]
Stephen Abootman	5	1	Who the hell are you?	['hell']
Stan	10	0	We're the ones you told to get Internet money.	[]
Kyle	12	0	Here.  We made ten million theoretical dollars. It's all for you.	[]
Stephen Abootman	13	0	Theoretical dollars? What am I supposed to do with that?!  You little timewasters!	[]
Stan	10	0	Hey, we worked really hard to get this theoretical money!	[]
Kyle	8	1	Yeah. Everyone thinks I'm a homo now.	['homo']
Cartman	5	1	...You are a homo, Butters.	['homo']
Kyle	14	0	Dude, will you just end this thing now?! My little brother is gonna die!	[]
Stephen Abootman	40	1	Nooooo! I'm not gonna look like an idiot! If I fucked up and led everyone astray, the last thing I'm going to do and admit it!  Yes, this is the head of the WGA. The World Canadian Bureau.	['fucked']
Swiss Delegate	19	0	Ah, Mr. Abootman. It's the global world summit leaders. We want to talk to you about the strike.	[]
Stephen Abootman	6	0	You... You do? You wanna negotiate?!	[]
French Delegate	22	0	No, actually we were just wondering if, when you're all dead, we can use Newfoundland for a new global theme park.	[]
Kyle	9	0	Hello? Will you just give this guy something, please?!	[]
Swiss Delegate	2	0	Excuse me?	[]
Kyle	25	0	He just doesn't wanna look like an idiot, so he wants everyone to think the strike was for something. Just, just give him anything!	[]
French Delegate	9	0	Well, we could give Canada some small consolation prize	[]
Kyle	11	0	If they give you something small, will you end the strike?	[]
Stephen Abootman	18	0	Will they... act like they're giving Canada a lot so everyone thinks I did a good job?	[]
Kyle	10	0	Can you act like you're giving him a lot?	[]
Swiss Delegate	3	0	Sure, why not?	[]
Stephen Abootman	3	0	We have won!	[]
Lumberjack	6	0	Well how much did we get?	[]
Stephen Abootman	54	0	Well, we uh, we didn't get everything that we wanted, but... we negotiated hard and... we got these...  coupons to Bennigan's! And...  free bubblegum... for every Canadian.  These coupons entitle every Canadian to a free meal at Bennigan's. With the purchase of a meal at equal or greater value, of course.	[]
Aide 1	3	0	We did it!	[]
Stephen Abootman	10	0	My friends. This is the greatest victory in Canadian history.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Ike. Ike!  It's over.	[]
Ike	3	0	It's over?	[]
Kyle	4	0	Yeah. Here you go.	[]
Stan	9	0	Boy, I'm sure glad that's over with.	[]
Butters	2	0	Me too!	[]
Kyle	89	0	Yeah, but you know, I learned something today. We thought we could make money on the Internet. But, while the Internet is new and exciting for creative people, it hasn't matured as a distribution mechanism to the extent that one should trade real and immediate opportunities for income for the promise of future online revenue. It will be a few years before digital distribution of media on the Internet can be monetized to the extent that necessitates content producers to forgo their fair value in more traditional media.	[]
Stan	1	0	...Yeah.	[]
Stephen Abootman	7	0	Yeah, we did it! Celebrate, everyone! Woohoo!	[]
Terrance	27	0	Hold on a minute! Wait just a second!  We just did some calculating! By NOT working during the strike, Canadians lost more than 10.4 million dollars!	[]
Phillip	16	0	And our Bennigan's coupons and bubble gum is worth roughly... three thousand and eight dollars!	[]
Stephen Abootman	11	0	Don't look at that. Come on, friends, let's dance.	[]
Phillip	28	0	You had no idea what you were doing and now you're trying to make it look like you won so that we won't set you adrift!	[]
Stephen Abootman	31	1	Damn it friends, don't you see? We won for future Canadians, guy. So the little guy doesn't get pushed around anymore. This was a victory for Canada's respect.	['damn']
Stephen Abootman	8	0	Eh?! What do you think you're doing?!	[]
Terrance	6	0	We're setting you adrift, idiot!	[]
Phillip	8	0	Maybe you can go live with the Danish!	[]
Stephen Abootman	6	0	You'll regret this day, friend!	[]
Phillip	6	0	I'm not your friend, buddih!	[]
Stephen Abootman	6	0	I'm not your buddih, guy!	[]
Terrance	6	0	He's not your guy, friend!	[]
Stephen Abootman	6	0	I'm not your friend, buddih!	[]
Terrance & Phillip	6	0	We're not your buddih, guy!	[]
Stephen Abootman	6	0	I'm not your guy, friend!	[]
