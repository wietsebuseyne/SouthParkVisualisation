Mr. Mackey	52	0	M'kay, kids, we have something very serious we need to discuss today, hm'kay? It appears that some kids in school are getting high by choking themselves. Some kids call it The Choking Game, hm'kay but, but choking yourself is bad. Hm'kay? Don-, don't do that. Hm'kay?	[]
Kyle	7	0	You can get high from choking yourself?	[]
Mr. Mackey	29	0	Schoolchildren are often experimenting with dangerous ways to get high, hm'kay, like sniffin' glue, guzzlin' cough medicine, huffin' paint, hm'kay? But they're all bad. M'kay?	[]
Butters	18	0	Mm-my cousin's in Florida, and said kids in their school get high off of cat pee.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Cat pee?	[]
Stan	15	0	That's not true. You can't get high off of cat urine, can you?	[]
Mr. Mackey	62	0	Well, it's a it's not actually cat urine, but male cats, when they're marking their territory, uh spread concentrated urine to fend off other male cats and... a-and that could get you really high. M'kay? Re-really reeeally high. Okay?  Probably shou-shouldn't have told you that just now. Hm'kay? Tha, that was probably bad.	[]
Cartman	25	0	All right, this should keep my cat in place while he spreads the urine.  Yesss, poor Mr. Kitty, are you just so upset right now?	[]
Kyle	6	0	You guys are wasting your time.	[]
Stan	6	0	Yeah, this is not gonna work.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Okay, ready Kenny?	[]
Kenny	2	0	(All set.)	[]
Cartman	8	0	All right, bring out...! The other male cat.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Ow.)	[]
Kyle	1	0	Whoa!	[]
Stan	4	0	Do you feel anything?	[]
Cartman	5	0	Well, Kenny? Are you buzzed?	[]
Kenny	5	0	(Hey cool! Check it out!)	[]
Father	13	1	I see that you're enticed by my daughter's awesome rocking tits.	['tits']
Kenny	1	0	(Yeahhh!)	[]
Father	20	1	Then bathe with my daughter in the fountain of Varnov. Appease the gods by lathering her boobs with soapy suds.	['boobs']
Kenny	1	0	(Okay.)	[]
Cartman	11	0	Kenny! Kenny, wake up!  Wake up, Kenny! You all right? Kenny!	[]
Kenny	5	0	(What?)  (Where'd she go?)	[]
Cartman	13	2	Dude, that cat urine really fucked you up. You were seriously tripping balls.	['fucked', 'balls']
Kenny	3	2	(You fucking asshole!)	['fucking', 'asshole']
Cartman	10	0	Agh, Kenny! Knock it off! What's wrong with you?	[]
Kenny	8	1	(What the fuck did you do that for?)	['fuck']
Cartman	2	0	Ah, Kenny!	[]
Kyle	5	0	Dude! Dude, Kenny, calm down!	[]
Kenny	11	1	(Oh, I was so close! You should have seen those titties.)	['titties']
Stan	2	1	What titties?	['titties']
Kenny	8	1	(The titties! Oh my god, they were incredible!)	['titties']
Kyle	18	0	Kenny, all you did after the cat peed in your face was start running around in circles cheering.	[]
Stan	15	0	Yeah, and then you ran through town screaming and started tearing off all your clothes.	[]
Kenny	4	0	(I almost... touched them.)	[]
Kyle	14	1	Dude, I don't think we should be messing around with that crap anymore.	['crap']
Announcer	16	1	Next on FOX News!  It's the newest drug craze. and it's killing your kids!	['drug']
Gerald	3	0	Killing our kids?	[]
Reporter	47	2	All over America, kids are getting high... on cat urine!  Huffing cat urine apparently causes a euphoric state  and is also referred to as... cheesing.  Why cheesing? Because it's fon to due.  This sixth grade girl said she's been snorting cat piss for several months.	['cheesing', 'cheesing']
Girl	24	0	We sometimes sneak out during recess and a friend named _________ goes and gets her cats, and we'll just cheese all day long.	[]
Gerald	8	0	Oh my God! Sheila! Come look at this!	[]
Reporter	80	3	So how can you tell if your child is cheesing?  1. Your child seems distant, preoccupied. 2. Your child's face smells like cat urine. 3. When you see tigers at the zoo, your child starts grinding his or her teeth. You might also notice by certain phrases your child says to school friends, such as Hey, let's go cheese. or Do you feel like cheesing, guys? or Dude, I'm cheesing my F-ing brains out right now.	['cheesing', 'cheesing', 'cheesing']
Sheila	4	0	Kids are doing this?	[]
Reporter	16	0	Kids do it because it's legal.  What can you do before it's too late?	[]
Gerald	9	0	We have to protect our children from this, Sheila.	[]
Gerald	42	2	Twenty percent of American students aged six to twelve say they have tried cheesing at least once. Kids also refer to it as the cheese game, or vitamin cheese, or Mary Jane piss in your face fun time. Cheesing is spreading fast.	['cheesing', 'cheesing']
Sharon	13	0	All right, we're all sufficiently scared, Gerald, but what could we do?	[]
Gerald	19	0	I have written up a bill that would make having a cat illegal in the city of South Park.	[]
Stephen	29	1	Gerald's right. We all have to face it. Cats are deadly animals! If you stick your nose up their crotch and snort their piss, they can kill you!	['crotch']
Gerald	21	0	With my super lawyer powers, we can rid our town of cats, so that our kids can never get high again!	[]
Randy	6	0	Let's hear it for Gerald!	[]
Stephen	3	0	Hooray for Gerald!	[]
Ruby Tucker	2	0	No! No!	[]
Agent 1	8	1	Oh wah wah! Get over it, druggie.  Jeez...	['druggie']
Girl 2's Father	6	0	Goodbye, Scrambles.  We'll miss you.	[]
Agent 2	3	0	Got two here.	[]
Kenny	7	1	(Hey! What the hell are you doing?!)	['hell']
Agent 1	4	0	Sorry, these are illegal.	[]
Kenny	8	1	(What?! No! What are you doing?!)  (You fuckers!)	['fuckers']
Cartman	36	0	Look, I told you, I had a cat. But I had it put to sleep 'cause it pissed me off.  Shh. Mr. Kitty, you have to live in the attic for now.  Here. Write a diary.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Guys, have you seen Kenny?	[]
Stan	8	0	Nah, I think Kenny's out sick today.	[]
Kyle	21	1	Yeah, and he was out sick yesterday too. Guys...  I think Kenny isn't here because he's at home cheesing.	['cheesing']
Butters	9	1	Aww, come on. Kenny knows how dangerous cheesing is.	['cheesing']
Stan	13	0	Yeah, and where is he gonna find cats anyway? They've been outlawed.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Yeah, who has cats these days?	[]
Kyle	42	1	Pot's illegal too, but people still manage to find it. Ever since that first time Kenny cheesed, he hasn't been the same. You've all noticed the change in him. I'll bet Kenny's at home cheesing right now.	['cheesing']
Kenny	3	0	(Woohoohoo! Woooohoooo! Woooohoohoo!)	[]
Kyle	1	0	Kenny?	[]
Stan	3	0	Kenny, you home?	[]
Kenny	4	0	(Wooooooooo! Woo! Wazzup? Wazzup?)	[]
Kyle	1	0	Kenny!	[]
Kenny	4	2	(Wazzup? Ho-Ho! Wooooooo!)	['ho', 'ho']
Butters	9	0	Whoa boy, he's cheesed out of his mind!	[]
"Stan, Kyle"	1	0	Kenny!	[]
Butters	8	0	There you go. Well, try some coffee, Ken.	[]
Kyle	8	0	Kenny, we need to have a serious talk.	[]
Kenny	5	0	(No we don't, guys.)	[]
Stan	17	0	Yes, we do. We're your friends, dude. We're not gonna let you ruin your life.	[]
Kenny	12	2	(I'm not ruining my life, okay, you God damned fucking psychos.)	['damned', 'fucking']
Kyle	11	0	Look at yourself! You've got to lay off the cheese!	[]
Butters	10	0	Yeah, that's it little buddy. Just let it out.	[]
Stan	23	1	Kenny, I know we're super-cool and everything, but if we ever catch you cheesing again, we're gonna tell on you.	['cheesing']
Kenny	8	0	(Oh okay, okay, I just wanna sleep now.)	[]
Butters	11	0	Yeah, he needs some sleepy night-night, doesn't he, buddy?	[]
Kyle	8	0	We've gotta keep this away from him.	[]
Cartman	69	1	Mr. Kitty, shhh!  Damn it!  Shhh, Mr. Kitty you have to be quiet, or else they're gonna find you.  What?!  It's the neighbor cat. He hasn't been caught yet.  No- no, Mr. Kitty. I know you like Rufus, but he has to fend for himself.  I can't hide anymore cats, Mr. Kitty.  I'm in trouble enough as it is.  All right, all right, fine.	['damn']
Cartman	47	0	All right. Come on, Rufus. Quietly.  Oh jeez, no, no, I can't hide you all.  I'm sorry, you'll just have to find somewhere else to-  Well, I suppose I'll get in just as much trouble for four cats as for two. Come on.	[]
Sheila	4	0	Huh?  Oh my God...	[]
Gerald	11	0	Kyle! Kyle, can we talk to you for a minute, please?	[]
Kyle	1	0	Yeah?	[]
Gerald	6	0	Kyle, have you been getting high?!	[]
Kyle	1	0	No.	[]
Gerald	11	0	Then why did your mother find this  in your dresser drawer?!	[]
Kyle	16	0	All right, look, th-that isn't mine. I'm just holding it for a friend.	[]
Sheila	6	0	Don't lie to us, Kyle!	[]
Gerald	8	0	How long have you been on the cheese?!	[]
Kyle	12	1	I'm not cheesing. I've never cheesed once in my life.	['cheesing']
Gerald	19	0	Get up to your room right now until your mother and I figure out how to deal with this!	[]
Kyle	10	0	Dad, will you just listen to me for a second?	[]
Gerald	2	0	Now, Kyle!	[]
Kyle	1	0	God!	[]
Sheila	13	0	Gerald, what are we gonna do? Our son is a cat pee addict!	[]
Gerald	9	0	First thing is we've gotta dispose of this!	[]
Sheila	5	0	What are you gonna do?	[]
Gerald	20	0	I'd better just... take it down to the basement for now, m-make sure Kyle can't find it.	[]
Gerald	100	0	No. No, what am I thinking? I shouldn't do this.  I've been clean for ten... years. I haven't even been near a cat.  But then that report said our kids were doing it too, and... and I knew Kyle would have the same sicknesses I used to have... Now a cat is in our home, and it's too tempting.  I... I'll just do it one more time.  One. Last. Time.  Then I'll call the police; have them pick up the cat.  And then I'll never do it again.  After this one... last... time...	[]
Gerald	9	1	I couldn't stay away. Curse your rockin' tits!	['tits']
Cartman	3	0	Who is it?!	[]
Woman	10	0	Please! Open the door.  They say you are hiding cats.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Hiding cats?  Why, that would be illegal.	[]
Woman	13	0	You don't understand  My little Nishka,  She has nowhere else to go.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Oh oh no no, I cannot possibly take in another.	[]
Woman	5	0	But they will find him.	[]
Cartman	30	0	I've already taken in the Andersons' cats, and the Willinskys'. There's simply nothinng else I can-  Then again... perhaps I could find space for just this one more...	[]
Woman	10	0	Oh, you show such kindness in such darkest of times.	[]
Cartman	8	1	What the hell?  Kenny, get out of here!	['hell']
Kenny	2	0	(Woooooh! Woooooh!)	[]
Cartman	5	1	Aw, crap- Kenny!  Bad. Kitties.	['crap']
Kyle	19	0	Dad! Somebody's at the front door!  Well am I grounded or not?!  Ugh. Fine! I'll get it!	[]
Stan	14	0	Dude, we've got a big problem. Cartman says Kenny is really messed up.	[]
Cartman	8	3	He's cheesing his fucking balls off, dude.	['cheesing', 'fucking', 'balls']
Kyle	1	0	What?	[]
Stan	14	0	He apparently got to all the cats Cartman's been hiding in his attic.	[]
Kyle	10	0	What are you doing with cats in your attic, fatass?!	[]
Cartman	24	0	They're innocent victims in this, Kyle! They have to hide or they'll be put to death! Something you just can't understand!	[]
Stan	11	0	Come on, we've gotta find Kenny before he hurts himself.	[]
Kyle	14	0	I can't. My dad grounded me. Wait a minute, where is my dad?	[]
Gerald	7	0	Hey everybody. Good to see you again.	[]
Father	10	1	Hold! You cannot yet caress my daughter's awesome boobage!	['boobage']
Gerald	3	0	Huh... how come?	[]
Father	4	0	There is... another suitor.	[]
Gerald	6	0	What?  Get out of here, kid!	[]
Kenny	7	1	(No, fuck you! She's my girl!)	['fuck']
Gerald	7	0	You're too young for this stuff!	[]
Father	9	0	This must be decided at the Breastriary in Nippopolis!	[]
Father	7	0	Now fight for the Loc-Nar trophy!	[]
Kyle	8	1	Dad? Dad! What the hell are you doing?!	['hell']
Jimbo	11	0	They've been goin' at it for a good thirty minutes.	[]
Gerald	6	1	She's mine, you little asshole!	['asshole']
Kenny	6	1	(Get the fuck off of me!)	['fuck']
Sheila	1	0	Gerald?!	[]
Reporter	25	1	The key proponent of the cat ban has been charged with cheesing in a public park. Gerald Broflovski is prepared to give a public statement.	['cheesing']
Gerald	24	0	I would like to address a personal matter: I have let myself down. And I would first like to apologize to my lovely wife.	[]
Sheila	4	0	Don't touch me.	[]
Gerald	67	2	And to the people of South Park.  I was wrong, and I can't let cats take the fall anymore. It's our fault. The people who use cats for their sweet urine.  We have to learn that cheesing just isn't worth it. Sure, you get to fight in the Breastriary, and swim in the Fountains of Varnov with the Itty Titty Fairies of Mammary Mountain.	['cheesing', 'titty']
Stan	7	1	What the hell is he talking about?	['hell']
Kyle	4	0	I have no idea.	[]
Gerald	25	1	And then you fight the Boob Goblin in the Gazongas Cave, and then the girl may thank you for it. But she. Isn't. Real.	['boob']
Randy	13	1	And you never really get a good look at her naked boobs anyway.	['boobs']
Gerald	27	0	Problem is, the more you into that world, the more you need to go. Until you start blowing off all the real people who care about you.	[]
Kenny	4	0	(Yeah. I guess so.)	[]
Gerald	50	0	Cats aren't the problem. We made cats illegal and and then I cheesed for the first time in ten years. And kids are always gonna find a new way to get high. Like sniffing glue or licking toads, or fermenting feces or huffing paint. You can also look at-	[]
Stephen	7	0	Uh okay, that's probably good, Gerald.	[]
Gerald	23	0	The point is, I was wrong. Its time to legalize cats!  Heh yeah! Hooray for Gerald! Hey, let's hear it for Gerald!	[]
Girl 2's Father	19	0	Scrambles! So good to have you back! You ain't sore at us, are ya?  Ahh! Get him off!	[]
Stan	8	0	I'm sure glad that's over with.	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Me too.)	[]
Cartman	24	0	But you know, we've all learned something, you guys. We can never persecute living beings and force them into hiding. It's wrong.	[]
Kyle	14	0	And you don't see any parallel between that and anything else in history?	[]
Cartman	12	0	Mmmmmmmmmm nope. I have no idea what you're talking about, Kyle.	[]
Stan	19	0	You guys! Check it out.  It's Kenny.  Isn't that great? He's just getting high on life.	[]
Kyle	8	0	Yeah.  He's getting... really high on life.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Dude, he's getting super-wasted on life.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Kenny!	[]
Stan	8	1	What the hell kind of flowers are those?	['hell']
Kyle	2	0	Kenny? Kenny?!	[]
