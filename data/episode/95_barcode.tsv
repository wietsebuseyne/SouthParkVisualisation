Clyde	5	0	Nobody wants to touch it.	[]
Kyle	18	1	What if the residue gets on our hands and it leads to harder drugs like those commercials say.	['drugs']

Clyde	17	0	And the commercial where the two kids have pot and the one kids shoots the other. Harmless?	[]

Stan	31	2	Fine, I will.  There, see? I touched marijuana. I'm not a terrorist, I didn't shoot anybody, and I don't feel like doing more drugs now. No big deal.	['marijuana', 'drugs']

Grandpa Marvin	8	0	Oh goody. Now we can watch the news.	[]
Tom	59	0	In other news, South Park police are still looking for a craaazy man who terrorized the town one hour ago.  The man claimed to be from the future and ran naked through the city streets screaming The past! The past! Oh my God, it's the past! Which is what one would expect someone in the future to yell.	[]

Future Stan	14	0	No, I'm you from the future!  Oh man, this is so messed up.	[]
Randy	5	0	Okay, we've had enough!	[]
Future Stan	38	0	Your name's Randy Marsh, you're a geologist, and you don't like chicken. Mom, your maiden name is Kimble and you have a scar on your left knee from when you slipped in the swimming pool.	[]
Sharon	5	0	Randy, what's going on?	[]
Randy	4	0	I don't know.	[]
Future Stan	16	0	Dude, just let me talk to you for like, five minutes. After that I'll bail.	[]
Future Stan	54	0	I can still remember when I was five and you both found that squirrel I'd been keeping in the closet and, you let me keep it for another week and then it ran away but... I know that's just what you told me. I know that Mom had actually let it out.	[]
Randy	15	0	How could he possibly know all that unless... he is our son from the future.	[]
Sharon	11	0	But why are you back in this time with us, son?	[]
Future Stan	66	1	I have no idea, man. I was just about to go asleep in an alley behind the crackhouse,  and I shot up a little heroin, and then this electrical storm started. Next thing I knew I was running around in my own past, man. I thought... I was just tripping, but then I came down and I was still here. Oh, dude, it's so bizarre!	['heroin']
Stan	9	1	Oh dude, I should have never touched that marijuana!	['marijuana']
Randy	9	0	Stan, whatever's happened, we going to help you.	[]
Sharon	12	0	That's right. We're a family no matter what time shift.	[]
Future Stan	6	0	Thanks. Can I get another beer?	[]
Sharon	11	0	You must be exhausted. Why don't you get some sleep?	[]
Future Stan	8	0	That'd be killer. Where can I crash?	[]
Sharon	13	0	Well I'm sure Stan wouldn't mind his room, would you, Stan?	[]

Singer	11	0	Here we are, face to face, My Future Self -n- Me	[]

Singer	7	0	So much alike, and yet so different	[]

Stan	2	0	Hey guys.	[]
"Kyle, Cartman"	1	0	Hey.	[]
Future Stan	12	0	Whoa, Kyle and Cartman! It's so cool to see you guys.	[]
Cartman	4	1	Who's this asshole?	['asshole']
Stan	27	0	This is my future self. He came during the electrical storm last night and is caught in a time matrix. He's me when I'm 32.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Wow. That's pretty cool.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Then how does he know our names?	[]
Kyle	14	0	'Cause, r-tard, he's Stan from the future. He knows everything Stan knows.	[]
Cartman	6	1	Ohhh. Wait. Stan becomes this douchebag?	['douchebag']
Future Stan	19	1	Yeah, I spent a lot of my teenage years on a slow downward spiral experimenting with drugs and alcohol.	['drugs']
Stan	3	0	Shut up, Cartman!	[]
Cartman	10	0	That is so awesome!! Thank you God!  Oh praise God!	[]
Kyle	8	0	Hey, what happens to me in the future?	[]
Future Stan	30	1	Oh, I don't know. You guys stayed away from drugs, so you're okay. I just lost touch with you after I was sent to Juvi Hall in 2006.	['drugs']
Cartman	10	0	Juvi Hall!  Stan's a loser! Stan's a loser!	[]
Stan	2	1	God-damnit!	['damnit']
Stan	9	0	Thanks for staying after school and tutoring me, Butters.	[]
Butters	16	0	Uh well, sure thing, Stan. Eh, how come you care about schoolwork all of a sudden?	[]
Stan	24	0	I told you, I can't stand my future self. I have to do whatever I can to not become a loser like him.	[]
Butters	12	0	Well, studying is the golden key to the imposing door of success.	[]
Stan	37	0	I just can't stand having my future self around all the time! It's driving me crazy!  Maybe if I get smarter I won't become him and I won't have to share my room!	[]
Butters	13	0	I know what you mean. I hate having my future self around, too.	[]
Stan	15	0	Yeah, it's like everything I do, he...  Wait a minute, what'd you say?	[]
Butters	38	0	I said, I know how you feel. My life has gone completely downhill ever since my future self moved in. I hate him! All he ever wants to do is watch Becker. And that show is so stupid.	[]
Stan	9	0	Dude, how long has your future self been around?	[]
Butters	10	0	Oh. I guess it's been around four months now.	[]
Stan	16	0	Four months?? And you never told anybody that you were living with yourself in the future??	[]
Butters	2	0	Nobody asked.	[]
Stan	4	0	Where is he now?	[]
Butters	3	0	Probably watching Becker.	[]
Becker	10	0	My name is T. Becker. The T stand for Terrific.	[]
Butters	13	0	See, here he is. Future Butters. Future self, this is my good friend,-	[]
Future Butters	13	0	Stan! Sure I remember you. Yep. Wearing that puff-ball hat like always.	[]
Linda	13	0	Oh, hello boys. Future Butters, it's time to take your liver medicine.	[]
Stan	2	0	Liver medicine?	[]
Butters	30	0	Yeah. My future self has a bad kidney from all the drinkin' he did in high school.  I need to learn to behave myself!  Hey! Where are you going, Stan?	[]
Stan	10	1	Alright, where is that son-of-a-bitch's wallet?!	['bitch']
Butters	8	0	Wha-, what are you lookin' for, huh Stan?	[]
Stan	29	0	Butters, don't you think it's a little bit of a coincidence that both your future self and my future self got caught in a mexterdexed time plane?	[]
Butters	17	0	Well they both got the same teacher for homeroom, too, but you didn't say anything then.	[]
Stan	27	0	Here it is.  It has to be something eh... Wait, what's this?  This expires in two thousand two. Why does he have this in his wallet?	[]
Butters	4	0	I don't follow.	[]
Stan	9	0	Three four five one Colfax Avenue. Come on, Butters.	[]
Butters	7	0	Oh! Are we out for an adventure?	[]
Stan	5	0	Here it is. Motivation Corp.	[]
Butters	19	0	I don't think we're supposed to go in there, Stan. Maybe we should go adventurin' somewhere else.	[]
Stan	17	0	Butters, part of being on an adventure is you go places you're not supposed to go.	[]
Butters	9	0	Oh. Well, you're good at adventurin', huh Stan?	[]
Stan	7	1	What the hell is going on here?	['hell']
A voice	29	0	It should take about a month to achieve the results you want.  Well, Mr. and Mrs. Brooks, I think you're going to be very pleased with the results.	[]
Mr. Brooks	17	1	We sure hope so. We just don't know how to talk to our son about drugs.	['drugs']
Director	25	0	Well now you won't have to! Ah, here he is. This is Josh Casher. He'll be playing the role of your future son.	[]
Josh	7	0	Nice to meet you, Mom and Dad.	[]
Mrs. Brooks	9	0	My goodness, he does look a little like Kevin.	[]
Director	25	0	Yes, and he knows all your family history and every detail of your house. And he's worked up quite a future for your son.	[]
Mr. Casher	26	1	I'm going to tell him that I dropped out of school and went to prison for eight years, where I was sodomized. In the ass.	['ass']
Mrs. Brooks	10	1	Woohoo, that should get Kevin to stay clear of drugs.	['drugs']
Mr. Brooks	5	0	Heh it sure should, heh.	[]
Director	23	0	Alright, then we'll put the fake news report out on Tuesday night. Make sure your son is watching the Channel 4 News.	[]
Mr. Brooks	14	0	Oh, and that's when uh you'll fake the electrical storm as well?	[]
Director	15	0	Motivation Corp. takes care of everything.  Just follow these simple scripts when your actor arrives.	[]
Mrs. Brooks	23	0	Listen to me, you crazy person, there's no way you can be from the future. Oh this is going to be fun.	[]
Stan	10	0	I can't believe it! It's all a scam!	[]
Butters	6	0	Yeah, I can't believe it!	[]
Stan	10	0	They've all been lying to us this whole time!	[]
Butters	30	0	This whole time! I wonder if my future self knows anything about this?  Hey, maybe my future self remembers this happening, a-and can shed some light on this subject.	[]
Stan	22	1	Butters, don't you get it?! Those assholes aren't our future selves! Our parents hired them to make us more motivated!	['assholes']
Butters	11	0	Eh, but then why did they come back to the past	[]
Stan	13	1	They didn't come back to the past, you dumbass, they're actors!	['dumbass']
Butters	9	0	Oh... Oohhhh.  But that's like they're lyin'	[]
Stan	17	0	It is lying, Butters. Your parents lied to you and my parents lied to me! Get it!	[]
Butters	16	0	Ohhh, that makes me angry! Why, if Professor Chaos were here he'd make everyone pay!	[]
Stan	3	0	Who's that?	[]
Butters	9	0	You know, Professor Chaos, bringer of destruction and disorder!	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Butters	17	0	Follow me back home, Stan. It's time I let you in on a horrible s-secret!	[]
Butters	17	0	Wait right here, Stan. I warn you: you may not like what you're about to see.	[]
Stan	20	0	We have to teach our parents a lesson! Show them they can't just play with our emotions like that!	[]
Butters	6	0	Now you know my terrible secret!	[]
Stan	15	2	...You're gay?  It's fine if you're gay, Butters. I don't care.	['gay', 'gay']
Butters	7	0	Huh? Naw, I'm Professor Chaos, Stan.	[]
Stan	24	0	But we have to teach our parents a lesson, Butters! We're running away! Help me find the perfect place to run away to!	[]
Butters	10	0	Mm. Uhm, maybe I used a little too much silver.	[]
Butters	9	0	How about this? Winter Farm. It looks kinda nice.	[]
Stan	7	0	No, we gotta run away somewhere warm.	[]
Butters	39	0	Wow, look at this, Stan.  Are you sick of your parents? Do you want revenge for something they've done to you? Call the Parental Revenge Center of Western America for a free con-sul-ta-tion. Results guaranteed.	[]
Stan	10	0	Dude, I didn't know there was such a thing.	[]
Butters	6	0	Hey look, somebody lost their pet.	[]
Stan	30	0	Uh, hi, is this the Parental Revenge Center of Western America?  Ah I'm really pissed off at my parents and I wanna impose swift and horrible revenge upon them?	[]
Butters	11	0	Look, you can make your wiener bigger in just three weeks.	[]
Stan	17	0	Oh really? Oh, okay, uh where are you located, please?  Great, uumm, can I come by tomorrow?	[]
Butters	17	0	This lady'll massage your wiener for ninety-five dollars. Well that's a pretty good deal.	[]
Stan	32	0	Eleven o'clock is great. Thank you.  That was easy! I just have to go to their office and they'll help me figure out how to get back at my parents!	[]
Butters	11	1	Hah-hey, I wanna get revenge on my douchebag parents, too.	['douchebag']
Stan	7	0	Fine, then you can come with me.	[]
Butters	15	0	Hooray!  And then we can make our wieners bigger, and have the lady massage them.	[]
Stan	5	0	I guess this is it.	[]
Stan	11	0	Uh hello, we're here about the revenge on our parents?	[]
Cartman	4	0	Yes, come in, please.	[]
Stan	1	0	Cartman??	[]
Cartman	11	0	Oh, Stan, Butters, I didn't know it was you guys.	[]
Stan	7	1	What the hell are you doing here?!	['hell']
Cartman	12	0	I'm running a business, Stan. Are you my eleven o'clock?	[]
Butters	9	0	You're the Parental Revenge Center of Western America??	[]
Stan	17	1	God-damnit, I knew this was too good to be true! Come on, Butters, let's go.	['damnit']
Cartman	54	0	Eh, so, you don't want to make your parents suffer and pay for mistreating you, then?  Look, ah, I don't know what your parents did to you, but if you're here, I take it they pissed you off pretty good. Maybe you should at least ...hear what I have to offer?	[]
Stan	9	0	Oh, sorry. I thought this was a legitimate business!	[]
Cartman	30	0	That it is, I assure you. I started this business over three months ago from the ground up. I've been helping children get back at their parents ever since.	[]
Stan	8	0	How many parents have you exacted revenge upon?!	[]
Cartman	56	0	Craig's. a-and Clyde's. Oh and and Kyle's, but that was a freebie. Look, I run a legitimate business here with state-of-the-art computers, charts, and technology. Look around you. I know how it feels to be really, really pissed off at your parents. And I will work hard, for you.	[]
Stan	26	1	Our moms and dads lied to us about those future selves! It was just a trick to get us to not wanna try drugs or alcohol.	['drugs']
Cartman	25	1	God-damnit! See? This is exactly why I started this business. If a parent can't respect their child, than who can they respect, huh?	['damnit']
Butters	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Cartman	42	0	Listen! Parents understand one thing, and that's consequences. They need to see consequences from their actions, or else they'll never learn. What my company does is inflicts those consequences upon the parents in a very real and very direct way.	[]
Stan	8	0	How much is this going to cost us?	[]
Cartman	24	0	Eighteen thousand dollars.  How about just... three hundred and eighty seven easy payments of a hundred ninety nine, ninety five.  How about five bucks?	[]
Director	15	0	So, everything is working out with your future actor? Your son seems to be responding.	[]
Randy	7	0	I think he's pretty scared alright.	[]
Sharon	14	0	It's just a little weird having people lying to our boy like this.	[]
Director	62	1	Well, you know what us ultra-liberals say, when it comes to children and drugs, lies are OK. The ends justify the means. We'll take smoking, for instance. The truth is there's no hard evidence that second-hand smoke can kill but, we believe it's okay to lie about it as long as it gets people to stop smoking.	['drugs']
Sharon	4	0	Well that makes sense.	[]
Director	45	1	So it is with everything here at Motivation Corp. It's okay for us to lie and tell kids that all marijuana supports terrorism.  Or that... one pill of Ecstasy is gonna kill them. It's not necessarily true, but the ends justify the means.	['marijuana']
Randy	14	0	Well I think when this is all over, our son is gonna thank us.	[]
Cartman	61	1	Okay, Butters, let's start with you. I think I've found a great way to get revenge on your parents. Just... tell me if I'm going in the right direction here.  What we're going to do, Butters, is we're going to wait for your parents to leave the house, and then, smear all the walls... with poop.	['poop']
Butters	7	0	Hwuhh. That'll make them awful sore.	[]
Cartman	14	1	Now, I want you to take a look at some of these poop swatches.	['poop']
Butters	3	2	Poop- poop swatches?	['poop', 'poop']
Cartman	21	1	Poop comes in a lot of varieties, Butters. I wanna find the perfect one, tailored to your revenge on your parents.	['poop']
Butters	6	0	Hey, that's neato, huh, Stan?	[]
Cartman	20	0	Now, personally, I like the baby green.  But I also think the classic brown would go nicely with your house.	[]
Butters	19	0	Wow, Eh eh you sure are a p-professional, Eric! I don't know which swatch I like best.	[]
Cartman	38	0	Well, y-you know what we could do, uh, uh Butters, is go with the baby green in the living room, and then maybe a classic brown, or even a nut-n-corn crunch in your parents' bedroom.	[]
Butters	4	0	Well that sounds good.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Okay, well let's do that then. That looks nice.	[]
Butters	1	0	Hooray!	[]
Cartman	55	1	Alright, now, Stan. For you I've put together a really nice design. I feel your parents were a bit more cocky about lying to you and your revenge needs to reflect that. So what I wanna to is put a note on your parents' door, telling them I'm the counselor from the school.	['cocky']
Stan	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Cartman	23	0	The note will inform them that a problem has come up and they need to see me right-away, back at my office.	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Cartman	20	0	Your parents will drive all the way out to the school and discover that no meeting is actually taking place.	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Cartman	14	1	And while they're gone, we're gonna smear all their walls with poop.	['poop']
Butters	2	0	Wow! Neato!	[]
Stan	6	0	That's not neato, that sucks.	[]
Cartman	1	0	What?	[]
Stan	18	1	You're gonna smear Butters' parent's walls with poop. I thought his revenge was unique and customized!	['poop']
Cartman	16	2	Poop-smearing is the hot ticket right now, Stan, and... have you seen the poop swatches.	['poop', 'poop']
Stan	45	1	Dude, that's not extreme enough! My parents aren't gonna learn their lesson from having some crap smeared on their walls! I want them to see what they did was wrong! I want them to have them to admit that they lied to me!	['crap']
Cartman	65	0	Okay, okay, fine. I I just, I just, ...my first idea. That's why we have these consultations.  Okay, okay, lemme, lemme see here. Uh. Oh wait, oh this is nice. How about this: uh, we'll lure your parents out of the house, and then we'll kill them. Uh, we'll cut them up into little pieces and feed them to the dog	[]
Stan	1	0	Dude!	[]
Cartman	7	0	Extreme enough for you? How's Wednesday?	[]
Stan	5	0	No, that's too extreme!	[]
Cartman	18	0	Well first it's not extreme enough and then it's too extreme; where do you want it?	[]
Stan	12	0	Just forget it, Cartman! You don't know what you're doing!	[]
Cartman	19	0	I'm a professional, suh!  Don't worry about it, Butters. You're gonna be a hundred percent satisfied.	[]
Stan	3	0	Hey future self.	[]
Future Stan	3	0	Yes, former self?	[]
Stan	42	0	You know that thing that I kept hidden in the hold in the wall for two years that I've never told anybody about?  You know, the thing that I take out of the shoebox every night before I go to sleep?	[]
Future Stan	2	0	Oh, uh...	[]
Stan	8	0	You must know what I'm talking about.	[]
Future Stan	21	1	Sure uh, uh,  oh man, could you all excuse me for a second? I think I'm gonna crap my pants.	['crap']
Sharon	14	0	Uh, Stan,  don't you think you're upsetting your future self a little?	[]
Randy	9	0	Yeah, Stan, don't be so hard on yourself.	[]
Stan	12	0	Mom, Dad, I don't think that guy is from the future.	[]
Randy	5	0	Oh. You. You don't?	[]
Stan	72	0	No.  You know what I think? I think this is all an elaborate hoax!  And I think that whoever is doing it doesn't have very much respect for me!  See, the best way to try to motivate somebody is by being direct with them, to be honest with them. I think the whole future self thing is a lie, and lies are never the right way to get your message across.	[]
Randy	7	0	Well, you know what I think, Stan?	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Randy	7	0	I think he IS from the future.	[]
Sharon	16	0	Yeah, he must be.  It's like, I just feel he's our son, you know?	[]
Randy	33	1	Right. That's mother's intuition; you can't argue with that. No, Stan, I think the only way you're gonna get of him is by staying clear of drugs and alcohol.	['drugs']
Sharon	1	0	Right.	[]
Cartman	34	3	Okay, very nice, very nice. Oh wait, uh, God-damnit! Felipe!  The classic brown poop is supposed to go in the parents' bedroom! The living room is supposed to be all baby green poop!	['damnit', 'poop', 'poop']
Felipe	6	0	Que? La caca no esta aqui?	[]
Cartman	15	0	La caca de moreno no es aqui! Aqui es verde, senor! Es verde! Arriba arriba!	[]
Felipe	3	0	Si, si senor!	[]
Cartman	35	1	Si, gracias. Y tu?  Carlos! Carlos, no! We want a textured effect on the nut-n-corn crunch poop. That's why we  spackle with the sponge.  See? Spackle gently. Lo marrado. Gently, see? Marrado.	['poop']
Carlos	2	0	Si. Marrado.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Marrado. Spectacularrr.	[]
Carlos	1	0	Si.	[]
Cartman	18	0	God, it's so hard to find good help.  Ah! Butters, like what you're seeing so far?	[]
Butters	7	1	Boy, it sure is stinky in here!	['stinky']
Cartman	24	1	Yeah, well, three hundred gallons of poop isn't gonna smell like a garden, Butters. But I think it's coming together real nice.	['poop']
Butters	19	0	Look, eh, Eric, I've been thinkin', my parents are gonna be awful sore and I don't think-	[]
Cartman	19	0	Yes, well, I've done my job, haven't I?  Pepite, Pepite, no! No come la taco la trabajar!	[]
Future Stan	14	0	Yes, well, it's hard to find work in commercials, so I ended up-	[]
Randy	2	0	Oh, Stan!	[]
Future Stan	18	0	Oh, dude, how's it goin', man? Ey, you wanna go upstairs and play hide and go seek?	[]
Stan	5	0	Hide and go seek, huh?!	[]
Randy	12	0	Yeah, Stan, why don't you go upstairs and play with yourself?	[]
Stan	10	0	I don't believe that he's my future self!	[]
Randy	22	1	Yeah, but we can't be sure, so we'd better assume he is and never try that first marijuana cigarette, huh?	['marijuana']
Stan	28	0	No, I actually have a way to be sure.  I'm going to cut off my hand. If he is my future self, then his hand will disappear.	[]
Sharon	15	0	S-stanley you don't need to do that. He-he is your future self.	[]
Stan	7	0	But I have to know for sure.	[]
Randy	17	0	Don't be silly, Stan. You don't wanna go through life without one of your hands.	[]
Stan	19	0	Maybe it's the hand I smoked that first joint with. Here I go. I'm gonna do it.	[]
Randy	1	0	Stan...	[]
Stan	1	0	Yes?	[]
Randy	4	0	Uh... nothing. Go ahead.	[]
Sharon	1	0	Randy!	[]
Stan	1	0	AAAH!	[]
Randy	16	0	AAAHHH! Oh my God! Look!  What? His hand did disappear! He is you from the future!	[]
Future Stan	5	0	Oh, Jesus Christ! Help me!	[]
Stan	15	0	That's weird, because I really didn't cut off my hand. It was fake.	[]
Randy	9	0	Uh..  Look, it was fake in the future, too.	[]
Sharon	12	1	Looks like you'd better really watch out for marijuana, huh Stan?	['marijuana']
Cartman	18	0	Well Butters, I hope you like the work. I'm sure your parents will be plenty pissed off.	[]
Butters	17	1	Uh, and after my parents get angry, uh how do we get the poop off the walls?	['poop']
Cartman	21	0	Ooo, ah, that's a different company.  Oh! Someone's here! We'd better run out the back! Pepite! Carlos! _Vamonos!	[]
Butters	6	0	Uh but Cartman! Wait!  Oh Christmas!	[]
Stan	1	0	Butters!	[]
Butters	2	0	Oh, Stan!	[]
Stan	10	0	Butters, we've go-! Oh, God, it smells in here.	[]
Butters	14	1	Yeah, well, three hundred gallons of poop isn't gonna smell like a garden.	['poop']
Stan	5	0	Butters, we're running away!	[]
Butters	2	0	We are?	[]
Stan	17	0	Our parents are never gonna admit what they did was wrong, and they're never gonna change!	[]
Stephen	5	1	What the hell is this?!	['hell']
Linda	5	0	Oh my God, our house!	[]
Butters	9	0	Oh Geez, ah, I'm gonna get it now	[]
Stephen	8	0	Butters! Do you have an explanation for this?!	[]
Butters	7	0	Oh, not really sir, I just uh...	[]
Linda	13	0	Wait a minute. Chris, don't you see? This might be our fault.	[]
Stephen	17	0	What, uh-? My God. You're right, Linda. This is what we get for deceiving our son.	[]
Stan	1	0	Huh?	[]
Stephen	13	0	Butters, listen. The whole future self thing, well, it was a dirty fib.	[]
Linda	23	1	We just so desperately wanted you to never try drugs that we used a big scare tactic instead of ...telling you the truth.	['drugs']
Stephen	16	0	We thought the ends justified the means, but they don't. They just... don't, son!	[]
Linda	4	0	We're sorry, baby.	[]
Stan	6	1	Get the fuck out of here.	['fuck']
Randy	17	0	Stan! Stan! Oh. Okay, uh, you you might be wondering why Butters has a future self, too.	[]
Sharon	16	0	Yes, well, eh you see, son, the time matrix pulled in more people from the future.	[]
Stan	29	0	Aw, stop it, you guys! I know all about Motivation Corp.! All I've been trying to get you guys to do is admit that you lied to me!	[]
Randy	19	1	Oh... Well... Son, we've just been trying to make sure you know how dangerous drugs like pot are.	['drugs']
Stan	33	0	I've been told a lot of things about pot, but I've come to find out a lot of those things aren't true! So I don't know what to believe!	[]
Randy	75	1	Well, Stan, the truth is marijuana probably isn't gonna make you kill people, and ...it most likely isn't gonna fund terrorism, but... Well son, pot makes yuu feel fine with being bored and... It's when you're bored that you should be learning some new skill or discovering some new science or... being creative. If you smoke pot you may grow up to find out that you aren't good at anything.	['marijuana']
Stan	14	0	I really, really wish you just would have told me that from the beginning.	[]
Sharon	24	1	He's right. If we use lies and exaggerations to keep kids off drugs, then they're never gonna believe anything we tell them	['drugs']
Randy	11	0	Well, there's only one person I can blame. Motivation Corp.!	[]
Director	14	1	Oh God, who smeared crap all over our walls?! Oh Jesus, it smells! Oh!	['crap']
Randy	7	0	You really did a nice job, Eric.	[]
Stan	21	0	Yeah, I gotta admit. You really came through. Thank you. I thought the hangover black went really nice in the lobby.	[]
Sharon	14	0	Well here, Eric, I baked you a huge box of cookies as a present.	[]
Cartman	35	0	Thanks. But you know, all this talk about future selves has made me think, maybe I should ...take better care of myself. I mean, maybe I should think about who I'm going to become.	[]
Future Cartman	9	0	Atta boy, Eric. You've made the right choice.	[]
Cartman	5	1	Who the hell are you?	['hell']
Future Cartman	52	1	Haha, it's me, Cartman! You from the future.  I came back to tell you that this is the day you turn it all around. You stop eating junk food and you start studying harder, you stay away from drugs and alcohol and you become CEO of your own time-travel company!	['drugs']
Cartman	15	0	Oh wow, really? That's so awesome! Now I'll really work to be successful!	[]
Future Cartman	2	0	Right on!	[]
Cartman	38	3	Go have sex with yourself, asshole! I'm not that stupid! Just for that, I'm gonna spend my whole childhood eating what I want, and doin' drugs when I want!  Whatevuh! I'll do what I want!	['sex', 'asshole', 'drugs']
Future Cartman	5	1	No, wait!  Oh, God-damnit!	['damnit']
