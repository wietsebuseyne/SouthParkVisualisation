Stan	8	0	Is this what you're looking for, Kyle?	[]
Kyle	6	0	No, I don't think so.	[]
Kenny	3	0	(How about this?)	[]
Kyle	6	0	No, that's a hair dryer!	[]
Manager	6	0	May I help you find something?	[]
Kyle	6	0	Yeah. Do you have any nurections?	[]
Manager	2	0	Any what?	[]
Kyle	9	0	I need to get a nurection for my dad.	[]
Manager	7	0	Very funny, boys. Go on, beat it.	[]
Stan	4	0	Why is that funny?	[]
Kyle	41	2	Dude, my mom and dad keep fighting all the time. And both of them say it's because my dad doesn't have a nurection. So I want to get him one.  Damn it! What the hell is wrong with everybody?	['damn', 'hell']
Stan	20	0	That's the fifth store we've been kicked out of. Why is it so hard to get a nurection?	[]
Kenny	5	0	(You guys, take it seriously.)	[]
Kyle	13	0	I just want a nurection so I can give it to my mom.	[]
Man	1	0	What?	[]
Kenny	13	0	(Well, see you guys. I gotta go take the bus out of town.)	[]
Cartman	14	0	Oh, where are you gonna go, Kenny? You gonna see your little girlfriend again?	[]
Kenny	4	0	(Yeah, you guys. Seriously.)	[]
Cartman	14	0	Dude, you spend way too much time with that girl. If you don't-	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Ach)	[]
Stan	6	0	Oh my God, they killed Kenny!	[]
Kyle	2	1	You bastards!	['bastards']
Cartman	6	1	What the hell happened to him?	['hell']
Stan	3	0	He just... ignited.	[]
Man	2	0	What happened?	[]
Woman	12	0	I saw it from across the street. He just caught on fire.	[]
Officer Barbrady	12	0	Okay people, stand back. Give the little burnt boy some breathing room.	[]
Blond Man	20	1	I've heard about this. This is... spontaneous combustion. But it usually only happens to fat people near open flames.	['fat']
Man 2	3	0	Is it contagious?	[]
Woman	6	0	Am I going to spontaneously combust?	[]
Man 3	8	0	I hope it doesn't happen to me.	[]
Woman	4	0	This is very scary.	[]
Mayor McDaniels	37	1	The people are panicking about spontaneous combustion. That's why I've assembled this crack team of scientists to find out the cause of the phenomenon. You are the best scientific mind South Park has to offer.	['crack']
Randy	6	0	...Uuuh. Mayor, I'm a geologist.	[]
Mayor McDaniels	1	0	Right.	[]
Randy	12	0	Well, uh I don't study human biology, I study the earth.	[]
Mayor McDaniels	35	0	Look, you're the only scientist that lives in this town. You have to find an answer before more people combust. You do that, and you'll be the most beloved man in South Park.	[]
Crowd	4	0	Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy!	[]
Man	4	0	We love you, Randy.	[]
Woman	6	0	Make love to me, Randy. Please!	[]
Randy	1	0	Wow.	[]
Mayor McDaniels	18	0	Marsh, I'm not asking you, I'm telling you! Find the cause of spontaneous combustion, or else!	[]
Randy	3	0	Or else what?	[]
Mayor McDaniels	1	0	Exactly!	[]
Stan	11	0	Dude, he looks so peaceful without his little orange coat on.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Priest Maxi	57	0	The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. Sometimes the giveth seems a little disproportionate to the taketh. There seems to be a lot more takething going on, but there it is. Perhaps if more of you attended church on Sundays , the Lord would not have felt it necessary to punish us by takething this little boy...	[]
Mr. Garrison	7	0	Oh, here comes the guilt trip again.	[]
Priest Maxi	44	0	Now, let us pray.  Lord, though we have lost Neil Smith to free agency and Steve Atwater to the Jets, still, we hope our beloved Broncos can bring home another Super Bowl championship, and once again bathe in the glory of your light. Amen.	[]
All	1	0	Amen.	[]
Priest Maxi	3	0	Let's go	[]
All	3	0	Let's go	[]
Priest Maxi	1	0	Broncos	[]
All	1	0	Broncos	[]
Priest Maxi	4	0	Let's go Broncos	[]
All	4	0	Broncos, let's go!	[]
Stan	4	0	Wow, that was short.	[]
Priest Maxi	9	0	Boys, I haven't seen you in church lately.	[]
Kyle	4	1	Well, I'm Jewish.	['jewish']
Priest Maxi	10	1	You're not too Jewish to worship Jesus, are you?	['jewish']
Kyle	3	0	I guess not.	[]
Priest Maxi	16	0	Good. Boys, how would you like to perform the Stations of the Cross this Friday night?	[]
Stan	2	0	The what?	[]
Priest Maxi	16	0	It's like a skit, where you reenact the death and glorious resurrection of Jesus Christ.	[]
Kyle	8	0	Hey, resurrection! That's what my dad needs!	[]
Priest Maxi	1	0	Huh?	[]
Kyle	8	0	We'll do it! We'll do it!	[]
Priest Maxi	16	0	Wonderful. Here's a book on how to perform it. Don't let me down, boys.	[]
Kyle	14	0	Dude, this is great! You know all the Stations of the Cross, right, Stan?	[]
Stan	15	0	I don't know, dude. I'm gonna have to go look in the Bible.	[]
Tom	3	0	Good night, Jerry.	[]
Jerry	5	0	See ya, Tom. Bye, Helen.	[]
Helen	3	0	Bye, Jer- aaa!	[]
Jerry	5	0	Oh my God, another one.	[]
Tom	2	0	Helen, no!	[]
Jerry	2	0	What happened?	[]
Man 5	15	0	God must be very angry with us. But why?  How have we angered you, Lord?	[]
Randy	13	0	Well, let's see. If they combust... no. Could be from the... no.	[]
Stan	5	0	Dad, where's our Bible?	[]
Randy	14	0	Not now, Stan. I have to find out what causes spontaneous combustion. Or else.	[]
Stan	3	0	Or else what?	[]
Randy	1	0	Exactly.	[]
Stan	1	0	...What?	[]
Randy	1	0	Right.	[]
Stan	4	0	Where's our Bible?	[]
Randy	35	0	It's in the attic with the old LP's.  Boys, did you notice anything uuuh strange about Kenny in the weeks leading up to his combustion? Ooh, what did he spend his time doing?	[]
Kyle	12	0	He didn't do anything. He was always with his new girlfriend.	[]
Randy	2	0	New girlfriend?	[]
Stan	29	0	Yeah, he started seeing this girl and he spent a lot of time taking the bus to go visit her. What does that have to do with his death?	[]
Randy	4	0	Maybe nothing...  maybe everything.	[]
Stan	13	0	...Well, we're gonna go work on getting Kyle's dad a nurection.	[]
Randy	11	0	Yes, yes, of course. I've got work to do.  What?!	[]
Stan	37	0	Let's see: Jesus got crucified, then he died, then three days later he had his urection. Let's see, there's fourteen Stations of the Cross. Now, it says we can makes costumes out of sheets.	[]
Kyle	5	0	This is gonna be fun.	[]
Cartman	5	0	I'm gonna be Jesus!	[]
Kyle	7	1	You're too fat to be Jesus!	['fat']
Cartman	9	1	Oh, and like you're gonna do it, Jew?!	['jew']
Kyle	4	0	Stan should be Jesus.	[]
Cartman	13	0	Either I'm Jesus, or else, screw you guys, I'm going home!	[]
Kyle	6	1	You're such a fat baby!	['fat']
Cartman	14	0	Well, I guess you guys can do the Stations of the Cross by yourselves.	[]
Kyle	12	0	All right, all right, you could be Jesus, you tubby cry-baby!	[]
Cartman	15	0	Stick and stones may break my bones, but I'm Jesus and you aren't.	[]
Randy	27	0	All right, all right, let's try it again. Kenny was standing here. Stan, Kyle and Cartman were walking around him.  Now, walk.  Do you feel hot?	[]
Randy	8	1	Damn it! How come you're not combusting?	['damn']
Townsman	5	0	Another one! Another one combusted!	[]
Randy	7	0	No! Has she been doing anything odd?	[]
Townsman	13	0	No, she was just on her way to her new boyfriend's house.	[]
Randy	9	0	Boyfriend. And they said Kenny had a new girlfriend.	[]
Randy	7	0	No! I think I might have it.	[]
Priest Maxi	23	0	Well, well, well. A lot of you came to church. Looks like we're a little nervous about this spontaneous combustion thing, huh?	[]
A few people	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Priest Maxi	55	0	Well, on this blessed Friday let us give thanks for stuff, and things.  Lord, is it so much to ask that you not let us suddenly burst into flame for no apparent reason? I mean, come on! Amen.  And now, some of our darling local children are going to perform the Stations of the Cross.	[]
Crowd	1	0	Awww.	[]
Stan	9	0	Station One: Jesus is condemned to death by Pilate.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Die!	[]
Cartman	14	0	Ow! You can do what you will, but I am the Lamb of God.	[]
Crowd	1	0	Awww.	[]
Someone	1	0	Phew.	[]
Stan	6	0	Station Two: Jesus takes his cross.	[]
Cartman	11	0	This cross is seriously heavy. Oh man, this is totally weak.	[]
Stan	9	0	And then Jesus' disciple, Peter, denies he knows him.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Peter!	[]
Kyle	6	0	I don't know you, dude.	[]
Cartman	16	1	Oh, Peter. Weak, Peter. Lame. But I'm Jesus, so I'll forgive you, I guess.	['lame']
Mayor McDaniels	1	0	Mayor.	[]
Randy	11	0	Mayor, I have it. I found out why people spontaneously combust.	[]
Mayor McDaniels	1	0	Why?	[]
Randy	18	0	Uh, it's too complicated to explain over the phone. Girlfriend ==> DEADBoyfriend ==> DEAD Call a town meeting tomorrow.	[]
Mayor McDaniels	20	0	Okay. If you're right about this, Marsh, you're going to be the most popular man in South Park.	[]
Crowd	4	0	Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy!	[]
Man	4	0	We love you, Randy.	[]
Woman	6	0	Make love to me, Randy. Please!	[]
Randy	1	0	Wow.	[]
Mayor McDaniels	1	0	Shmuck!	[]
Stan	8	0	Station Eleven: Jesus is nailed to the cross.	[]
Cartman	16	0	Oh! This has gone from weak to superweak! Things cannot get any more weak for me.	[]
Stan	17	0	Then a crown of thorns was placed on Jesus's head, and Jesus was all like, Thanks.	[]
Cartman	24	0	Well, this sucks that I have to die, but if I die, everyone's sins will be forgiven.  So I guess it's cool.	[]
Stan	19	0	And then Jesus was lead away  to Mount Sinai, where he dies, and has a resurrurection three days later.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Hi, mom.	[]
Priest Maxi	9	0	Thank you, boys. Blessed be the name of Jesus!	[]
Crowd	8	0	It's a great name, isn't it?	[]
Kyle	9	0	Hey, that went really well. They really liked it.	[]
Cartman	12	0	Yeah. I told you I'd be a sweet Jesus, you guys.	[]
Kyle	12	0	Aw man, at least the real Jesus didn't weigh 400 pounds!	[]
Cartman	6	1	Up your ass with broken glass!	['ass']
Stan	4	0	This spot looks good.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Yeah. That looks pretty good.	[]
Stan	5	0	Okay, cool. See you, Cartman.	[]
Cartman	8	1	Hey, wait! Where the hell are you going?!	['hell']
Stan	11	0	Huh I don't know. I'm going home, I guess.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Yeah, me too.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Well, get me down from here!	[]
Kyle	31	0	Cartman, how stupid are you?! Didn't you read the Bible? We have to leave you up there until you die, and then you come back to life in three days.	[]
Cartman	1	0	What?!	[]
Stan	8	0	Yeah, dummy, you have to get a nurection.	[]
Kyle	8	0	Then I can give it to my dad.	[]
Cartman	35	0	Hey, uh I don't wanna be Jesus anymore! Don't leave me here, you guys! ...All right, that does it! Screw you guys, I'm going home!  Okay, I'm getting pissed now!  God!	[]
Mayor McDaniels	29	0	All right, people. Scientist Marsh and I have been working very hard on the problem of spontaneous combustion, and we have finally come up with a solution. Mr. Marsh?	[]
Randy	107	2	The little boy combusted because he had a new girlfriend. It wasn't the girl that caused him to combust, it was the fact that Kenny did not want to pass gas in front of her.  You see, as food is digested the natural processes give off a byproduct known as methane gas.  The methane gathers here in the bowel area , where it causes pressure. Normally a person would expel this byproduct in the form of a pleasant fart.  Should the gas not be expelled,  the methane can build up and then ignite,  leading to... disaster.  Kenny combusted because he held his farts in for too long.	['fart', 'farts']
Townsman	14	1	You mean, all we have to do is fart and we won't explode?	['fart']
Randy	1	0	Exactly.	[]
Mayor McDaniels	25	1	So, from this day forward, everyone in South Park will be required to fart on a regular basis to insure that nobody else spontaneously explodes.	['fart']
Crowd	4	0	Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy!	[]
Man	4	0	We love you, Randy.	[]
Old Woman	6	0	Make love to me, Randy. Please!	[]
Stan	6	0	Whoa, dude, my dad's famous.	[]
Kyle	14	0	Come on. Let's go see how Cartman is doing with his uh, urection.	[]
Stan	3	0	Wow, he died.	[]
Kyle	16	0	Now we just gotta wait for his urection, and I can give it to my dad.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Hey, there you guys are!	[]
Stan	1	0	Cartman??	[]
Cartman	12	0	You guys are in big trouble! Now get me down from here!	[]
Kyle	8	0	How come you're not dead yet, Cartman?!	[]
Cartman	8	0	You guys, I mean, seriously! Get me down!	[]
Stan	18	0	Look, fatass: after you die and get resurrurected, you'll have all kinds of superpowers, just like Jesus.	[]
Cartman	1	0	...Really?	[]
Kyle	10	1	Yeah. So hurry up and die, you piece of crap!	['crap']
Cartman	24	1	...When I get all my superpowers, I'm gonna use them to smote you two assholes right off the planet!  Dude, superpowers are sweet.	['assholes']
Mr. Mackey	2	0	Hi, boys.	[]
"Stan, Kyle"	3	0	Hi, Mr. Mackey.	[]
Mr. Mackey	15	0	Have you guys been sure to pass gas regularly so you don't spontaneously combust?	[]
Kyle	7	1	We know how to fart, Mr. Mackey!	['fart']
Mr. Mackey	17	0	Well, let me show you, just to be sure, m'kay?  Hmm, come on. Be good, now.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Jesus Christ!	[]
Stan	2	0	(Sick, dude!)	[]
Mr. Mackey	9	0	I had a steak wrapped with bacon last night.	[]
Kyle	7	0	(Dude, I think you pooed a lot.)	[]
Mr. Mackey	12	0	So, you boys understand you have to do that regularly, oh-mkay?	[]
Stan	5	0	(Okay, okay, just go away!)	[]
Kyle	8	0	God, that was not cool at all, dude!	[]
Liane	9	0	Oh, hello boys. Have you seen Eric around anywhere?	[]
Stan	8	0	Uh. We've been taking care of him.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Yeah. We're having him resurrurected.	[]
Liane	12	0	Oh, all right. I was just at the store buying some apples.	[]
Stan	1	0	Apples?	[]
Liane	5	0	Yes. Apples.  Ahapples, get it?	[]
Stan	1	0	(Dude!)	[]
Kyle	1	0	(Sick!)	[]
Liane	5	1	Stinky apples. See you, boys.	['stinky']
Stan	9	0	(I don't think I like this new law.)	[]
Liane	1	0	Squeaker!	[]
Mayor McDaniels	25	0	And so I declare today Randy Marsh Day, where we shall remember forever how he freed us all from the threat of spontaneous combustion. Gentlemen?	[]
Bearded Man	5	0	You're the best, Randy!	[]
Randy	16	0	I am? I am, huh? I never knew the depth of my scientific genius until now.	[]
Kyle	12	0	It's too bad Cartman can't be here to enjoy this.	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Cartman	9	0	You guys, seriously! somebody get me down from here!	[]
Officer Barbrady	6	0	Nur nunur nunur nunur nunur nunur-	[]
Cartman	2	0	Officer Barbrady!	[]
Officer Barbrady	11	0	T. T is for turtle.  Nur nunur nunur nunur nunur nunur...	[]
Cartman	15	1	Ey! Help me, you son of a bitch!  Huh, I'm gonna die up here.	['bitch']
Announcer	16	0	We now return to the 42nd Annual Nobel Prize Awards. Here again your host, Whoopi Goldberg.	[]
Whoopi	24	0	Republicans are so stupid.  I hate Republicans.  Republicans are so stupid.  And now, here to present the Nobel Prize for Science is Nick Nolte	[]
Nick Nolte	61	2	Science is good. Science is very important. This year's nominees are: Herald R. Pinkerton, for his further development of the grand unified theory of physics.Randy Marsh, for his formulated break-wind theory of spontaneous combustion.And Alphonse Mephesto for his seven-assed Galapagos turtle.And the Nobel Prize goes to:  Randy Marsh, for the theory of spontaneous fart things.	['assed', 'fart']
Mephesto	6	0	No! No, this can't be!	[]
Randy	54	1	Whoa hoho, whoa!  Oh wow, oh, ah, I'm the best! Yeah! Yeah! Ah, it's just so amazing to be told that you're the best. I, I thought I was just a normal person like all of you, but... Yeah! Well, thank you for showing me otherwise! Yeah! I kick ass, yeah!	['ass']
Mephesto	19	0	Fixed! Fixed! That was supposed to be my award, Kevin. I'll get him for this. Mark my words.	[]
Stan	14	0	Wow, my dad's the best! All other dads suck compared to my dad!	[]
Kyle	7	0	Hey! My dad's pretty cool, too.	[]
Gerald	4	0	I'm sorry, honey.	[]
Sheila	16	0	It's okay,  I'll just call some 20-year old and have him come over.	[]
Gerald	1	0	What?!	[]
Sheila	4	0	I'm just kidding.	[]
Gerald	10	0	Kidding? Well, that's not funny! That hurt my feelings!	[]
Sheila	1	0	Why?	[]
Gerald	1	0	Why?!	[]
Sheila	1	0	Kyle.	[]
Kyle	12	0	Don't worry, guys. I'm getting a nurection as we speak.	[]
Gerald	1	0	Huh?	[]
Kyle	18	0	Well, actually, Cartman's getting a nurection. But then, we're gonna give it you. Sooo, buck up!	[]
Sheila	8	0	We have a very strange little boy, Gerald.	[]
Stan	6	0	Dude, he's still not dead.	[]
Cartman	15	0	You guys, my mom is totally worried about me. You'd better let me down.	[]
Kyle	6	0	She's not worried about you.	[]
Cartman	22	0	Yes she is! I've been hearing her all day! Listen! Listen.  Eric? Eric, where are you? I miss you very much.	[]
Stan	6	0	That's not your mom calling!	[]
Cartman	21	0	Yes it is, you guys. I'm serious now. This is Eric's mom and I want him home right now.	[]
Kyle	21	1	How stupid do you think we are?! Now you die on that cross and get resurrurected before I kick your ass!	['ass']
Cartman	13	0	You guys, it's too hot out here! I can't do this!	[]
Stan	10	0	He is right. It has been getting really hot lately.	[]
Kyle	13	0	Yeah, I noticed that too. Let's go get some ice-cold lemonade.	[]
Stan	2	0	Hey, yeah!	[]
Cartman	28	1	Oh! God-damnit! Urh! You guys! You guys wanna hear my I hate Stand and Kyle song?! Ahem.I hate Stan and KyleI seriously hate Stan and Kyle...	['damnit']
Mayor McDaniels	17	0	My God, it's burning up in here! Can't we crank the AC up some more?	[]
Aide 2	5	0	It's already on full.	[]
Randy	6	0	You wanted to see me, Mayor?	[]
Mayor McDaniels	15	0	Yes, Marsh. We have a new problem, and I think only you can solve it.	[]
Randy	10	0	I suspect you're talking about the dramatic heat wave.	[]
Mayor McDaniels	15	0	Yes. The temperature is steadily rising every day. I want you to find out why.	[]
Randy	19	0	Mayor, I think I'm a little overqualified for this. My scientific mind is best used on global problems.	[]
Mayor McDaniels	7	0	All right, all right. Name your price.	[]
Randy	8	0	Ten thousand. I have to protect my talent.	[]
Mayor McDaniels	7	0	Done. Just find out what's happening.	[]
Randy	15	0	Don't worry, Mayor. I'll find the cause. Or else. Or else what? Exactly.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Hey you guys. Seriously.	[]
Chef	5	0	What the-?  Oh, what now?!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Chef! Chef!	[]
Chef	7	1	Children, what the hell are you doin'?	['hell']
Cartman	13	0	Just get me down from here!  Oh, finally! My arms are killing me!	[]
Chef	10	0	You children shouldn't be crucifying yourselves in this heat.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Sweet. Now, I'm gonna go kill those guys!	[]
Chef	15	1	Eric, I have to tell you something, and it's really gonna bum you out.	['bum']
Cartman	1	0	What?	[]
Chef	7	0	It's really gonna piss you off.	[]
Cartman	1	0	What?!	[]
Chef	12	0	This is just a dream. You're still up on that cross.	[]
Cartman	2	1	Oh, damnit!	['damnit']
Stan	6	0	Dad, where's the phone book?	[]
Randy	24	0	Not now, Stanley. Without my scientific genius, the town is doomed.  Let's see now, when exactly did the temperature start to go up?	[]
Jesus	22	0	Our topic tonight is the rising temperatures in South Park. Let's go to the phones.  Caller, you're on the air.	[]
Stan	17	0	Yeah, um, Jesus, after you got crucified, how long did it take you to die and resurrect?	[]
Randy	1	0	Stan?	[]
Jesus	11	0	That's not the topic tonight. The topic is global warming.	[]
Stan	1	0	Oh.	[]
Jesus	8	0	Do you have an opinion on global warming?	[]
Stan	4	1	Uh, it... sucks ass.	['ass']
Jesus	31	0	Okay! Thank you caller. Well, let's go to our first guest, Dr. Alphonse Mephesto.  Thank you for coming. You claim to know the cause of global warming in South Park.	[]
Mephesto	50	2	I most certainly do! The cause of global warming is  Randy Marsh!  It was Marsh's theory on spontaneous combustion that told everyone to fart all they want. Now all the methane from all those farts has ripped a hole in our ozone layer. We are all doomed to die!	['fart', 'farts']
Randy	2	1	Awww crap.	['crap']
Townsman	3	0	Go get him!	[]
Townsman 1	3	0	We want answers!	[]
Townsman 2	5	0	You've killed us all!	[]
Townsman 3	5	0	Someone's got to pay!	[]
Woman	5	0	It's out of control.	[]
Mayor McDaniels	5	0	Boy, they're really pissed.	[]
Randy	17	0	Well, they're right. We should have known that all that methane could adversely affect the atmosphere.	[]
Mayor McDaniels	10	0	Well, let's go talk to them. Stick by me.	[]
Randy	1	0	Hey!	[]
Townsman 4	4	0	You killed us all!	[]
Townsman 5	7	1	Shove that Nobel prize up your ass!	['ass']
Stan	7	0	Oh my God, what's going on?	[]
Townsman 6	31	3	Now we either hold in our farts and spontaneously combust, o-o-or we let our farts out and kill our entire planet. Well I, for one, am not farting anymore!	['farts', 'farts', 'farting']
Randy	9	0	Uuuh, I- I'll try to find a solution.	[]
Townsman 7	7	0	We don't want your solutions, phony!	[]
Townsman 8	4	0	Give me that!  Yeah!	[]
Townsman 9	7	1	Damn you Marsh! Get out of town!	['damn']
Townsman 10	2	0	You fraud!	[]
Randy	4	0	Mr. Garrison, help me!	[]
Mr. Garrison	7	0	I, I do not know you, sir.	[]
Townsman 11	2	0	Up your-	[]
Townsman 12	1	0	Arrn!	[]
Kyle	3	0	Yeah, take that!	[]
Stan	5	0	Dude, that's my dad!	[]
Kyle	3	0	...Oh, yeah. Sorry.	[]
Anchor	74	3	The spontaneous combustion problem escalates as more and more people go back to holding in all their farts.  Meanwhile, the ozone layer continues to deplete as others refuse to hold in their farts for fear of combustion. As we all know, the cause for all of this is Randy Marsh, the son of a bitch who calls himself a scientist. We caught up with Mr. Marsh earlier today and he had this to say:	['farts', 'farts', 'bitch']
Randy	8	0	I-I don't know what to say.	[]
Anchor	29	3	What an asshole! I hate that guy, and so do you. And now, on to the weather. It's fucking hot, thanks to Randy Marsh, son of a bitch!	['asshole', 'fucking', 'bitch']
Kyle	5	0	Dude, those people are pissed!	[]
Stan	3	0	I know, huh?	[]
Kyle	4	0	Where's your dad?	[]
Stan	15	0	He's hiding down in the basement. I I don't know what to do.	[]
Kyle	14	0	Well, you have to help him, just like I have to help my dad.	[]
Radio Talk Show Host	30	0	Still more up next from the heat wave caused by Randy Marsh. A giant glacier is melting above South Park and the entire town is doomed. And now, these messages.	[]
Bob Dole	32	0	Having a hard time with male potency?  Well, I don't, and I'm Bob Dole. What's wrong with you? Christ, I'm Bob Dole and I can get it up.	[]
Blonde	4	0	Are you a lawyer?	[]
Gerald	1	0	Yes.	[]
Blonde	6	0	We want to sue Randy Marsh.	[]

Randy	2	0	Hm. Really?	[]
Stan	19	0	Dad, you've got to work! People are dying, dad. You've got to come up with a solution!	[]
Randy	24	0	Not me. I'm not a scientist, I'm a hack. Even if I found a solution, those people would still all hate me.	[]
Stan	14	0	Well, that doesn't matter! I learned something from the Stations of the Cross.	[]
Randy	1	0	What?	[]
Stan	65	0	See, at first, Jesus was all like, Why me? And he was all pissed off and stuff. But then he saw that what mattered most was everybody else. So he stopped thinking about his own misery, and did what had to be done. Right as Jesus was dying,  he raised his hand and said, The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.	[]
Randy	18	0	You're right, Stanley. You're absolutely right.  Hey, that Bible sounds like kind of a good book.	[]

Townsman 16	7	0	Could I borrow one of your rocks?	[]
Randy	35	3	It's all about moderation. If you never fart, you combust, but if you always fart, you deplete the ozone. So we must fart only at appropriate times or when it's really, really funny.	['fart', 'fart', 'fart']
Townsman 17	1	0	Huh?	[]
Randy	25	1	I know you all hate me, but please, for your own sake, fart in moderation. You can keep stoning me now, if you want.  Ow.	['fart']
Mayor McDaniels	17	0	And so we salute Randy Marsh and his unified theory of moderation that has saved us all.	[]

Cartman	9	0	Hey you guys, I am really pissed off now.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Dude! You're still alive, Cartman?	[]
