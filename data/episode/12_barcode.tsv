Pip	4	0	What do you mean?	[]
Cartman	42	2	Well. First I kick you in the nuts as hard as I can, then you kick me in the nuts as hard as you can, and we keep going back and forth until somebody falls. The last one standing gets the arrowhead.	['nuts', 'nuts']

Anchor	32	0	...and finally tonight, a young boy from South Park, Colorado found something very interesting during a field trip today. Here with a special report is a quadraplegic Swiss man on a pony.	[]
Quadraplegic Swiss man	20	0	Thanks, Tom, the little eight year old was very shocked indeed when he came across a very ancient triangular object.	[]
Kyle	28	0	Well, I was just digging around, and I was all like, 'dude, I found this triangle' and my friends were like, 'dude' and I was all like 'dude.'	[]
Cartman	37	2	...and I told him. I said, 'Kyle, I will kick you in the nuts.' But he didn't give it back to me. So I kicked him square - in the nuts, and he cried - like Nancy Kerrigan!	['nuts', 'nuts']
Kyle	3	0	You liar, Cartman!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Screw you, triangle thief!	[]
Quadraplegic Swiss man	24	0	And so, the little boy will take his discovery home and perhaps donate it to science... mwell a little later. Back to you, Dave.	[]
Dave	18	0	Thanks Tom. Those are some cute, cute kids, except for that last one-he's a little tubby.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Eeyy!	[]

Kenny	15	0	(Yeah, and I got this nice marble sack to go with this carrot stick, see?)	[]
Kyle	8	0	What would we use a marble sack for?	[]

Chef	8	0	Come on, man. What is this all about?	[]
Leonard Maltin	27	2	If Barbra Streisand saw the same report I did, then those boys are in grave danger. If you were Barbra Streisand, where would you be right now?	['streisand', 'streisand']

Milo	3	0	Are you sure?	[]
Barbra Streisand	10	0	I'm sure! He knew about the symbol of Krewluck!	[]
Milo	8	0	Then why don't we go get it?	[]
Barbra Streisand	60	0	A cop showed up - he's a clever one - I can't blow everything now that I'm this close. Everything must be handled very carefully.  How many years has it been, Milo? Thirty? Forty? For so long I have waited to find the other triangle, and now I am so close. The Dawn of Zinthar is close at hand!	[]
Ike	1	0	Cokeshen.	[]

Leonard Maltin	10	1	Are you sure Barbra Streisand has a condo up here?	['streisand']
Chef	13	0	It was just a rumor. A lot of big celebrities have mountain condos.	[]
Leonard Maltin	7	0	Then we've got to keep looking.	[]
Chef	23	0	Alright. Leonard Maltin, this has gone far enough! I ain't drivin' another mile until you tell me what this is all about!	[]
Leonard Maltin	12	1	Haven't you ever been curious about the insanity Barbra Streisand exhibits?	['streisand']
Chef	11	1	Well, I always heard she was kind of a bitch, but-.	['bitch']
Leonard Maltin	31	2	More than a bitch! She's a calculating, self-centered egotistical bitch! She was born in a small town, her mother was a jackal, and her father was an insurance salesman.	['bitch', 'bitch']
Chef	4	0	Woohoohoohoo. An insurance salesman?	[]
Leonard Maltin	38	0	When she was five, she knew that she wanted to be a famous singer, but by the time she was six, her ambitions became to rule the univese. She learned of an ancient diamond, the Diamond of Pantheos.	[]
Chef	17	0	Okay. You know what? Never mind, I don't need to know all this!  Forget I asked!	[]
Leonard Maltin	45	1	Before she was seven the keepers of Pantheos learned of this insane little girl's wish. The diamond was split up, and buried at opposite ends of the world. But then, during the shooting of My Fair Lady, Barbra Streisand found one of the triangles.	['streisand']
Chef	11	0	And the other triangle is the one that little Kyle has?	[]
Leonard Maltin	28	1	Yes, Mr. Chef. If Babs gets ahold of that other triangle, she will fulfill her prophecy, and become the most threatening thing ever known to mankind. Mecha-Streisand!	['streisand']
Chef	19	2	Mega-Streisand? Oh, man, I don't know what the hell that means, but it doesn't sound good.	['streisand', 'hell']
Stan	6	0	Man, the bus sure is late.	[]
Cartman	16	0	Hmmm. I wonder what I should do with my triangle, now that it is mmyy triangle.	[]
Kyle	12	1	Dammit Cartman! I gave it to you so you would shut... up.	['dammit']
Barbra Streisand	9	0	Oh, hello there, little boys. How are you today?	[]
Stan	1	0	Fine.	[]
Barbra Streisand	25	0	That is great. My name is Mrs. Jones, and I am a very friendly, nice person.  I hear that one of you found my triangle.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Your triangle?	[]
Barbra Streisand	29	0	Yes. You see, that triangle is part of my kidney dialysis machine. I'm so glad you found it, because without it I was sure to die within hours.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Oh no you don't! Finders Keepers!	[]
Barbra Streisand	4	0	But I'll die.	[]
Cartman	35	2	Well, I guess we'll have to roshambo for it. I'll kick you in the nuts as hard as I can, then you kick me square in the nuts as hard as you can...	['nuts', 'nuts']
Barbra Streisand	21	0	I want to give you a big cash reward for finding it. It's worth a lot of money to me.	[]
Cartman	2	0	It is?	[]
Stan	9	1	Hey, no wonder that Barbra Streisand lady wanted it.	['streisand']
Barbra Streisand	5	0	Oooh, hahahah. Who is that?	[]
Kyle	14	0	Oh, just this really really old lady who wishes she was still only 45.	[]
Stan	17	0	Yeah, and you should have seen her nose. It was big enough to land stealth bombers on.	[]
Cartman	13	1	Yeeh, stealth bombers  Yeah, and talk about a bitch, I haven't seen-	['bitch']
Barbra Streisand	38	0	ENOUGH!!  Oh, Haa-ha. Anyway, if you'll come with me in my car, I'll take you up to my condo where I'll kill you - I I mean-uh, uh give you - moneyy - for the triangle.	[]
Cartman	21	1	Sweet! I'm gonna be rich. Bet you wish you hadn't given me that triangle back now, huh, Kyle? Dumbass!	['dumbass']
Kyle	13	0	Wait. Isn't there some rule about not getting into cars with strnagers?	[]
Cartman	7	0	No, not when money is involved, stupid!	[]
Director	2	0	And. Action!	[]
Sidney Poitier	28	1	Rebecca, I'm a man. A man like any other with dreams and emotions. And that's why I'll never put a foreign object up my ass.	['ass']
Director	18	0	Cut, great, print that. Excellent work, Sid. Take five, guys, let's set up for the next shot.	[]

Sidney Poitier	1	0	Excellent!	[]
Barbra Streisand	19	0	Eh. Soon, the triangle of Zinthar will be mine, and I will be the biggest, most famous person ever!	[]
Cartman	5	0	Ugh. Llet me go! Seriously!	[]
Stan	4	0	Yeah, let us go!	[]
Barbra Streisand	21	0	You fools have no idea the powers that you are meddling with! I'll teach you to meddle with my triangle!	[]
Cartman	10	0	Eey!  It's not my triangle, it's Kyle's!	[]
Kyle	11	0	Hey! Don't try to pass it back on me, fatass!	[]
Cartman	6	0	Eechh! Screw you, hippie! Eeeh-eh.	[]
Barbra Streisand	6	0	Wheeere is the triangle of Zinthar?!	[]
Cartman	4	0	I don't remember.	[]
Kyle	7	1	Goddammit tell her! I wanna go home!	['goddammit']
Barbra Streisand	7	0	Maybe this will help jar your memory...	[]
Cartman	5	0	No! Don't!  AAAAAA! AAAAADUH!	[]
Barbra Streisand	4	0	NOOOW do you remember?!	[]
Cartman	7	2	WAAAGH! Damn your black heart, Barbra Streisand!	['damn', 'streisand']
Stan	12	0	Ugh. I don't know how much more I can take, dude.	[]
Barbra Streisand	11	0	Alright. You asked for it!I'm gonna tell you now...	[]
Chef	18	1	Eeeeh-I don't know, man. Maybe Barbra Streisand doesn't have a place up here after all.	['streisand']
Leonard Maltin	11	0	Well, looks like we'll have to go to plan B.	[]
Chef	24	1	There's a plan B? Why the hell have we been driving around all night and day for, when there's a plan B.	['hell']
Leonard Maltin	10	0	Have you ever heard of the band called, The Cure?	[]
Chef	16	0	Ooh, come oonn! Don't tell me The Cure has something to do with this too!	[]
Leonard Maltin	8	0	No, no. Just the lead singer.  Oh! Ah!	[]
Chef	9	0	Who-o-oa! What's the matter, Leonard Maltin?	[]
Leonard Maltin	11	0	She's close! She's very close-I can feel her.	[]
Chef	1	0	Where?	[]

Cartman	14	0	Okay, okay. I'll tell where the triangle is. It's inside my shoe.	[]
Kyle	15	0	Aagh! For Christ's sake, Cartman, when was the last time you changed your socks?	[]
