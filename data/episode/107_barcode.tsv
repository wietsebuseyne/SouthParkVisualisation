Stan	6	0	Dude, I wonder where Kyle is.	[]

Cartman	9	1	Butters?! You're gonna take THAT butt hole?! Why?!	['butt']
Kyle	9	1	Because Butters isn't a total dick to me!	['dick']
Cartman	8	1	I have never been a dick to you.	['dick']
Kyle	17	1	Oh please! All you ever do is call me names and rip on me for being Jewish!	['jewish']
Cartman	12	1	Kyle, when have I ever ripped on you for being a Jew?	['jew']
Kyle	51	18	Oh yeah?! Well you're a stupid Jew! You're a Jew! Shut your God-damned Jew mouth! Good job, Jew! Jew... Shut up, Jew! You're Jewish!! Dude, he's Jewish! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew?!

['jew', 'jew', 'damned', 'jew', 'jew', 'jew', 'jew', 'jewish', 'jewish', 'jew', 'jew', 'jew', 'jew', 'jew', 'jew', 'jew', 'jewish', 'fuck']
Cartman	7	0	Okay, except maybe for that one time.	[]
Kyle	15	1	You've always been a dick to me, Cartman, and I'm not inviting you.	['dick']
Cartman	30	0	Kyle, you don't understand! Casa Bonita is my most favorite place  in the whole world. I'll just, I'll just die if you don't take me! Please!	[]
Kyle	6	0	Sorry, my mind's made up.	[]
Cartman	90	5	Well fuck you, Kyle!! I don't wanna go to your faggy birthday party anyway! I'd much rather hang out at home than have to be around you and your Jew mom for a day!  Kiss my balls, asshole!!!  Dude, I totally didn't mean that, Kyle.  I really really wanna go to Casa Bonita. I'm sorry we had that fight just now. You know, I mean, I said some things, you said some things, but, I think it was good and we-we've moved past it.	['fuck', 'faggy', 'jew', 'balls', 'asshole']
Kyle	8	0	I'm not inviting you to Casa Bonita.	[]

Kyle	10	0	I'm not inviting you, Cartman. You can't go.	[]
Cartman	27	1	No! Noooo!  Casa Bonita! Noooo!  AAAAH!!  Oh... God-damnit, I have to get invited to go! I'm just gonna have to start being nice to Kyle!	['damnit']
Cartman	2	0	Hi Kyle.	[]
Kyle	5	0	That isn't it, Cartman.	[]
Cartman	4	0	What isn't it?	[]
Kyle	13	0	That's not being nice! That's just putting on a nice sweater!	[]
Cartman	6	0	...I don't understand the difference.	[]
Kyle	5	0	I know you don't.	[]
Cartman	13	0	Jimmy! Hey Jimmy, wait up!  Dude, uh I need your help on something.	[]
Jimmy	14	0	Well, sure, Eric. W-w-what seems to be the p-p-p-prrroblem?	[]
Cartman	31	0	Well, everybody likes you, Jimmy, a-and you seem to be really good with people, so, I was wondering if you could tell me, how do you act nice to people?	[]
Jimmy	19	0	Well, the best thing is not to act nice, Eric. Uh, the best thing is to be genuinely nice.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Okay, so how do you act genuinely nice to people?	[]
Jimmy	35	0	Well, Eric, pah part of being nice is just making people smile and laugh. The best way to do that is by telling a fan-tastic joke or a humorous anti-d- ant'duhh ...anecdote.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Like what?	[]
Jimmy	10	0	Well, like, try this one on for size: Knock knock.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Who's there?	[]
Jimmy	9	0	Ing-mar ...Bergman.  Now you say, Ingmar Bergman who?	[]
Cartman	46	1	Take that, Jimmy!  And that! And don't you ever talk bad about Kyle again!  Kyle is my friend! And if you say you had sex with his mom one more time, I'm gonna really let you have it! You hear me?!  Oh, Kyle. Hey.	['sex']
Kyle	13	0	Do you really think that beating up a handicapped kid is being nice?	[]
Cartman	9	0	Uh...  He-hey Kyle! Knock knock.  Knock knock, Kyle!	[]
Kyle	5	0	Yeah, Casa Bonita, this Saturday!	[]
Butters	7	0	Wow, that's gonna be so fun!	[]
Stan	10	0	Yeah, it'll be awesome. Just the four of us.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Yeah!)	[]
Cartman	2	0	Hey Kyle.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Well?	[]
Cartman	2	0	Well what?	[]
Kyle	14	0	How are you going to try to get invited to Casa Bonita this time?	[]
Cartman	13	0	I'm not, Kyle. I know you already told Butters he could go.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Oh. Well... yeah. I, I did.	[]
Cartman	71	1	So, fine, Kyle, but honestly, I never meant to make you feel like you didn't matter at all to me. I know we argue all the time and I give you tons of crap, but we've also been through a, a lot together, and... maybe that alone doesn't make us friends, but it makes us something. So, ...whatever, you know, just... ah I hope... things will be cool.	['crap']
Kyle	9	0	I'm still not inviting you to Casa Bonita.	[]
Cartman	8	0	I know, Kyle. I'll see ya later.	[]
Kyle	13	0	Eh... hey, Cartman?  You really don't care that you can't go?	[]
Cartman	22	0	I care, sure, but I hope it doesn't mean you and me and Stan and Kenny can't hang out anymore.	[]
Kyle	28	0	That's exactly what I wanted to hear from you all along. Ah uh I still have to take Butters, but... I hope things can be cool too.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Good.	[]
Kyle	19	0	And, and hey, if for some reason Butters can't go to Casa Bonita, you can take his place.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Sweet, whatever.  Bingo!	[]
Butters	6	0	What's this all about, Eric?	[]
Cartman	6	0	Butters, can you keep a secret?	[]
Butters	4	0	Well, sure I can!	[]
Cartman	30	0	For the past five days I've been looking out into space for a school project. This morning, at 3:45 a.m. I... caught first sight of something terrible.	[]
Butters	3	0	Nnn-how terrible?	[]
Cartman	12	0	A meteor. A meteor the size of Wyoming, heading right for earth.	[]
Butters	1	0	What??	[]
Cartman	31	0	Now look, ah I could be wrong. I ...pray that I'm wrong, but, I just want you to take a look and... see what you think.  Do you see anything?	[]
Butters	4	0	I just see stars.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Keep looking. Sometimes it takes your eyes a minute to adjust.	[]
Butters	25	0	Nope, uh I don't see any...  Oh wait. Oh my God! I see it. I see it! It's a meteor! Oh my God!	[]
Cartman	11	0	Oh my God! Does it look like it's getting closer?	[]
Butters	9	0	It is! It is getting closer! Oh my God!	[]
Cartman	19	0	Oh my God! That meteor is the size of Wyoming and it's on a collision course for Earth.	[]
Butters	9	0	When do you think uh it'll get here?	[]
Cartman	28	0	I, I don't know, I, have to do some calculations.  10 to the power of 1 base 9 divided by pi plus 5 minus 3. Oh Jesus.	[]
Butters	1	0	What??	[]
Cartman	16	0	According to my calculations, that meteor is going to hit Earth in less than four hours.	[]
Butters	7	0	Oh, you mean we're gonna die?!	[]
Cartman	26	0	No! No, Butters, we are going to live! Do you hear me?! We are going to live! We just... We've gotta find a bomb shelter!	[]
Butters	7	0	Wha...? Where is there a bomb shelter??	[]
Cartman	16	0	Stan's Uncle Jimbo! He has a bomb shelter in his backyard! Come on, Butters! Hurry!	[]
Butters	1	0	AAAAHH!	[]
Butters	2	0	Oh Jeez!	[]
Cartman	9	0	Here we go! The bomb shelter's down here!	[]
Butters	4	0	Oh God! Oh Jesus!	[]
Cartman	18	0	All right, we should be safe in here. This dried food and water should last us for weeks.	[]
Butters	17	0	But what about everyone else? I have to tell my parents so they can come here, too.	[]
Cartman	17	0	No! Butters! I can't let you risk it. I'll go up and get the others.	[]
Butters	3	0	Are you sure?	[]
Cartman	46	0	I'm not sure of anything anymore.  Now Butters, listen: No matter what happens, no matter what you hear, do not come out! If I don't make it back in time with the others, then it will be up to you to repopulate the Earth.	[]
Butters	15	0	But I'm the only one down here. What am I supposed to repopulate with?	[]
Cartman	23	0	Well, you know, with your wiener.  Just stay down here until you hear word from me. And... pray, Butters... pray for all mankind.	[]
Butters	4	0	Oh God, oh God!	[]
Kyle	12	0	Where is Butters? We were supposed to leave here forty minutes ago.	[]
Sheila	14	0	Well I think we better just go without him, Kyle. It's getting late.	[]
Kyle	8	0	Yeah, screw him. Let's go.  Oh, finally!	[]
Cartman	14	0	Happy Birthday, Kyle. I just wanted to stop by and give you your present.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Oh. Thanks, dude.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Hope you have a good one. See you later.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Oh wait. Cartman.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Yes?	[]
Kyle	13	0	Uh Butters didn't show. You wanna go to Casa Bonita with us?	[]
Cartman	22	0	Butters didn't show? I I can't believe it. Uh are you sure you told him the right time and everything?	[]
Kyle	12	0	I told him 5:30 and we gotta get going. You in?	[]
Cartman	25	0	Well I... really would need to go home first and get my... Weh no no, I guess I have everything I need. Oh, okay, sure.	[]
Kyle	5	0	All right, let's go.	[]
Sheila	6	0	Okay, boys. Get in the car.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Casa Bonita, here we come! Casa Bonita! Casa Bonita!	[]
Sheila	4	0	Oh, hello Chris, Linda.	[]
Chris	9	0	Hello everyone. Have any of you seen our son?	[]
Kyle	11	0	Butters was supposed to go with us to Casa Bonita tonight.	[]
Chris	31	0	We know, but... he hasn't been home since last night. The police have been looking everywhere, but...  Well, thank you. Uh, please, let us know if you find out anything.	[]
Linda	2	0	Oh Butters!	[]
Kyle	3	0	Aw dude, weak.	[]
Cartman	13	0	Yeah. Man, that sucks about Butters.  Well, let's get going, shall we?	[]
Kyle	17	0	Nah. Dude, I c-I can't go to have a birthday party while Butters is missing.	[]
Stan	5	0	Yeah, it's kinda weird.	[]
Cartman	24	0	Ee-yeah yeah. I think you're right, but, on the other hand, I think Butters would want us to go. You know Butters...	[]
Kyle	10	0	Nah, I can't. We should help look for him.	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Sheila	15	0	That's very good of you, boys. We can postpone Casa Bonita until next Saturday.	[]
Cartman	29	0	Next Saturday?? I'll never be able to keep Butters in the...  In the... depths of my heart for that long. I sure hope he... turns up before then.	[]
Stan	15	0	Dude, we should check over at Stark's Pond. Butters always hangs out over there.	[]
Kyle	9	0	Yeah. And then we can try the football field.	[]
Sheila	5	0	I'll drive you boys.	[]
Cartman	18	1	Oh, God-damnit! How am I gonna keep Butters down in that bomb shelter for a whole week?!	['damnit']
Captain	37	0	All right, folks, this is the little boy we're looking for:  Leopold Stotch, also known as Butters. He's been missing for two days and was last seen at the school. Let's go find him.	[]
Butters	11	0	Dried food rations. Add water to feed flavored square...  Hello?  Hello??	[]
Cartman	1	0	Butters!	[]
Butters	1	0	Hwaaaah!!	[]
Cartman	8	0	Butters! Oh God, it was... It was horrible!	[]
Butters	5	0	Wuh, wait, well, what happened??	[]
Cartman	15	0	The meteor... struck the Earth sooner than I predicted. There was no time... no time...	[]
Butters	8	0	What about my parents. Did you see them?	[]
Cartman	38	0	There was mass confusion! Pa... panic! People were crawling all over each other in the streets! It was... awful! When it hit, millions were evaporated instantly. The rest of us... walking around in a... cloud of... toxic... radiation.	[]
Butters	6	0	Oh my God, let me see!	[]
Cartman	28	0	No Butters!! If you come up, you'll get infected too! You best wait for the radiation level to go down. Probably... next week sometime. After Saturday. Ugh...	[]
Butters	11	0	How many survivors are there? You should all come down here.	[]
Cartman	23	0	We can't come down there, or else, we'll contaminate you, Butters. No... we just have to survive the best we can.	[]
Butters	15	0	Wow... Eric, I can never thank you enough for everything you've done for me.	[]
Cartman	36	0	Thank me by living, Butters. Live. And... rebuild.  I've got to go. Remember, wait one week for the toxic levels to go down. On Saturday.  G-goodbye!  All right. Just six days, Butters. Sit tight.	[]
Field Reporter	22	0	Tom, it has now been three days since the Stotch child has gone missing. Townspeople continue to search, but hope... is dwindling.	[]
Captain	30	0	All right, folks. I wanna thank you for all your efforts. Three days is a long time, but we've got to keep going if we're gonna find him.	[]
Cartman	18	0	Heh you're not going to find him. Not until after Saturday when I go to Casa Bonita.	[]
Captain	26	0	Many times in cases like these a child can trap themselves. It is important that we spread our search to duct pipes, wells, and bomb shelters.	[]
Cartman	3	0	What what what?	[]
Captain	22	0	I say we need to move the search to ducts, wells, and bomb shelters. Let's move out, people! Every second counts!	[]
Cartman	1	0	UUuuugh!!	[]
Butters	36	0	But if you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me.Oo-oo-ooooo-oo girl, baby please don't go. Eh,Oo-oo-ooooo-oo girl- Eric?  Eric, is that you?	[]
Cartman	19	0	Oh God! They're coming! They're coming! We gotta get out of here! They're coming this way!	[]
Butters	5	0	Who's coming this way?	[]
Cartman	37	0	The cannibals! Don't you know? The meteor destroyed all of society, Butters. Now Earth is ruled by packs of wild humans gone mad! Those of us who survived are now being hunted by flesh-starved cannibals!	[]
Butters	5	0	Oh God! I hate cannibals!	[]
Cartman	27	0	They're coming this way! I can hear them coming. They'll find you down here for sure. And when they do, they'll eat you alive.	[]
Butters	1	0	Noooo!	[]
Cartman	37	0	We've gotta get you out of here! Come on! Oh oh no wait, I forgot! The toxic radiation! Hey wait! We can use this box!  There we go. This should keep you protected from the toxins.	[]
Butters	6	0	But I can't see nothin'.	[]
Cartman	36	0	Believe me, Butters, you don't wanna see what's up there. Now come on. I'll guide you to a safer location. </> There you go. Two more steps and you're at the top.  Good.	[]
Butters	6	0	Are we out in the destruction?	[]
Cartman	20	0	Yes. There's nothing but smoldering bodies all around you. Burnt out buildings, and what used to be our town.	[]
Butters	2	0	Aw man.	[]
Cartman	12	0	All right, this way, Butters. Just follow the sound of my voice.	[]
Cartman	20	0	Right now we're walking by what used to be people's houses, now just smoldering burnt piles of rubble.	[]
Butters	5	0	Huh... Oh, it's terrible.	[]
Cartman	21	0	We're coming now to the crater where the meteor hit. A hole in the Earth over two miles in diameter.	[]
Butters	1	0	Whoa!	[]
Cartman	23	0	Here we are at the old gas station. It survived a lot of the impact. We might be safe here.  Oh my God!	[]
Butters	1	0	Whaaat??	[]
Cartman	7	0	It's a cannibal! Stay back, cannibal!	[]
Butters	1	0	AAAAHH!	[]
Cartman	26	0	We've got to fight them off!  Stay away from Butters! He's humanity's last hope!  Awww! He bit me! He bit off my hand!!	[]
Butters	1	0	Waaaaaah!	[]
Cartman	18	1	Aw man, he's eating my hand like a piece of chicken! Can you hear the bones crack?	['crack']
Butters	1	0	Ooohhhh!	[]
Cartman	32	0	Wait! Look here! There's a dead body with an axe in the back. I'll pull out the axe and use it to chop off the cannibal's head. Hunh!  Die!	[]
Butters	5	0	Ooooh, what happened? What happened?!	[]
Cartman	24	0	The cannibal! The cannibal's dead, Butters! But he bit me,  which means soon I will have a taste for human flesh as well.	[]
Butters	2	0	Oh no!	[]
Cartman	20	0	We have no choice, Butters! We have to lock you away somewhere where even I can't get to you!	[]
Butters	3	0	Uh w-where??	[]
Cartman	21	0	Look! There's an old refrigerator!  Get inside, Butters! I'll break off the handle so nobody can get to you!	[]
Butters	4	0	Aren't you coming?	[]
Cartman	44	0	Too late for me. I can already feel my... body start to... change.  No! Must... fight... it... Don't open this door for anybody, Butters! No matter what you hear, stay inside for four days! Here's some water and food from the shelter.	[]
Butters	14	0	Eric, you're the ...best friend in the whole world. I... I love you.	[]
Cartman	15	0	I love you too, man. I just  You look so delicious! Must eat your brains!	[]
Cartman	21	1	Hah!  It's Wednesday! It's Wednesday!  Only three more days till Casa Bonita.  Oh, that would be so bad-ass!	['ass']
Butters	120	1	Finally I can breathe a-  Oh my God. Oh my God, the meteor took out everything! It's all destroyed. Nothing left.  Hello? Are there any, are there any other survivors? Hello? Oh. That must have been where the library was. And that was probably the school. Hello?  Oh. I forgot, I gotta watch out for radioactive cannibals.  Is that a cannibal? Sir? Ma'am?  Oh. Aww, it's a little dog.  Well, hello there, Mr. Dog. Looks like you and me are the only ones who survive the meteor, heh. We should stick together, huh, Mr. Dog? Well come on, we gotta start cleanin' up this mess, and rebuild this civilization. Boy, that meteor sure did make everything stinky.	['stinky']
Cartman	46	0	We're on our way to Casa Bonita! We're gonna be there very soon. You're gonna love Casa Bonita, Stan. There, there's this one part where you can dress up in Old Western clothes and get your photo taken in a fake jail.	[]
Stan	1	0	Really?	[]
Kyle	5	0	Yeah, it's pretty cool.	[]
Cartman	53	0	Pretty cool. So, um, should we go to Black Bart's Cave first or watch the puppet show? I think we should go through Black Bart's Cave right away 'cause, we're gonna wanna do it seven or eight times. And then we'll watch the cliff divers before the puppet show.	[]
Stan	14	0	Dude, it's Kyle's birthday. We should do whatever he wants to do.	[]
Cartman	22	1	What? Fuck Kyle.  Ha ha, j-just kidding, birthday joke. Of course we'll do whatever Kyle wants, uh. Happy Birthday, Kyle.	['fuck']
Cartman	5	0	Happy Birthday to you. Happy-	[]
"Stan, Cartman, Kenny"	11	0	Birthday to you. Happy Birthday dear Kyle. Happy Birthday to you. .	[]
Butters	34	0	You take away the biggest part of me.  Woo-oo-ooooo-oo-oo, uh baby please don't go.  Woo-oo-ooooo-oo-oo, I just had to find my say to you tan...	[]
Worker	1	0	Hello?	[]
Butters	7	0	HAAAAGH! Who are you? Are you infected?	[]
Worker	2	0	With what?	[]
Butters	7	0	You're not a cannibal, are you?	[]
Worker	1	0	No	[]
Butters	28	0	Oh.  Oh good. You're a survivor, like me. Look, Mr. Dog, another survivor. And it's a lady, too. That means we can repopulate the earth. Yippee!	[]
Worker	6	0	Kid, what are you doin' here?	[]
Butters	72	0	I'm rebuilding society. Here, take a look.  This is the library, and over here is the bank. That over there I'm thinking into a P.F. Chang's or a Bennigan's. And this  is a memorial to Eric Cartman, the person who gave his life so that I could rebuild society. Well ma'am, I guess we should start repopulatin' the earth, huh?  I'm ready whenever you are.	[]
Worker	17	0	Kid, I don't know what you think is going on, but this place is a dump.	[]
Butters	16	0	Hey, that's not very nice! This is my first society! I'm doin' my best!	[]
Worker	31	0	No, I mean you're at the garbage dump. The town is right over there, everybody is fine, and I think they've been looking for you for over a week.	[]
Butters	8	0	Oh...  Ma'am, can I use your phone?	[]
Cartman	16	0	We're here! We're here! Casa Bonita!  Aw man, this is gonna be so great!	[]
Sheila	30	0	Wait up, Eric. We need to stay together.  Uh, hold on boys, that's my cell phone.  Hello? Yes. Oh, that's great!  Boys, they found Butters.  He's okay.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Oh, awesome.	[]
Stan	6	0	I knew he'd turn up.	[]
Sheila	9	0	Yes, Eric Cartman is with us. Why?  Oh really?	[]
Kyle	1	0	What?	[]
Sheila	28	0	Yes, I will certainly let him know. Thank you.  Well, it appears that Eric here is responsible for Butters missing, because he wanted to go to Casa Bonita.	[]
Kyle	1	0	What?	[]
Sheila	18	0	Eric, the South Park Police are already on their way here to have a little talk with you!	[]
Cartman	3	0	But... Casa Bonita.	[]
Kyle	13	0	I should have known better! You never cared about my birthday at all!	[]
Cartman	5	0	But I...  but...  Stand back!	[]
Stan	3	0	Cartman, stop it!	[]

Captain	7	0	All right, kid! End of the line!	[]
Cartman	3	0	Ah.  Uh.  Yeeeesss!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Jesus Christ!	[]
Captain	29	0	Well kid, you made an entire town panic, you lost all your friends, and now you're going to Juvenile Hall for a week! Huh, was it worth it?	[]
Cartman	1	0	Totally.	[]
