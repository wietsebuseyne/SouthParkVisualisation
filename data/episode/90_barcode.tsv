Tweek	4	0	Oh God! Oh Jesus!	[]
Tweek's Mom	15	0	What if that had been a child abductor pretending to be a police officer, Tweek?	[]
Richard	37	0	He would have sprayed your brains all over the floor and then taken your body off to the woods.  You've got to be on your toes, Tweek. Alright, now go to bed and get some rest.	[]
Tweek's Mom	2	0	'Night, pumpkin.	[]
Stan	8	1	I hope this movie doesn't suck ass.	['ass']
Kyle	2	0	It will.	[]
Cartman	2	0	One please.	[]
Tweek	9	0	Wait, that's not the usual ticket-taker guy!	[]
Kyle	1	0	So?	[]
Tweek	6	0	So? I don't know him!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Dude, relax.	[]

Tweek	7	0	I don't know you!  Ah, AAAH!	[]
Man in Wheelchair	37	0	Oh, hey, kid!  Oh, thank God you happened by. My- my chair ran out of juice right on these train tracks. If you hadn't had shown up, well... Well, anyway, could you give me a push?	[]
Tweek	2	0	Huh uh!	[]
Man in Wheelchair	37	0	No, no, you don't understand. I'm, I'm paralyzed from the neck down. I push the chair with this device in front of my mouth, but it's it's not working, so you see-	[]

Man in Wheelchair	12	0	Please, this, this isn't funny, kid. You have to help me.	[]
Tweek	13	0	But it could be a trick!  Ugh. That's a pretty good trick.	[]
Tweek	1	0	AaaaAAAHH!	[]
Man	16	0	Relax, Tweek. I am not here to hurt you. I am the Ghost of Human Kindness.	[]
Tweek	5	0	The Ghost of Human Kindness?	[]
The Ghost of Human Kindness	9	0	You have never seen the likes of me before.	[]
Tweek	4	0	What do you want?	[]
The Ghost of Human Kindness	14	0	You have lost faith in humanity, lad. Something I cannot bear to see happen.	[]
Tweek	19	0	Huh-uh, how can I help it? It seems that everywhere I turn, someone is out to get me.	[]
The Ghost of Human Kindness	26	0	That is the world of the news reports. It is the world that adults preoccupy themselves with, but it is not the world as it is.	[]
Tweek	3	0	It isn't?	[]
The Ghost of Human Kindness	45	0	Look here, Tweek. This woman is on her way to the retirement home.  She doesn't get paid; she volunteers her time to talk with lonely elderly people who want nothing more than a friend.  But do you hear about her on the news? No.	[]
The Ghost of Human Kindness	29	0	Now gaze upon this humble house, Tweek. Inside there are two people who have adopted needy children.  They were strangers to those kids once. Now they are loving parents	[]
The Ghost of Human Kindness	33	0	Now, look here, boy.  A car has broken down with a flat tire, and two complete strangers have stopped to help.  Will their kindness be reported on the news tomorrow? I think not.	[]
The Ghost of Human Kindness	6	0	Are you starting to understand, boy?	[]
Tweek	30	0	I think so. You mean that, even though all the news is about murderers and abductors, those kind of people... only make up a very small part of the world.	[]
The Ghost of Human Kindness	15	0	That's right, lad. So do you think you can learn to trust people now?	[]
Tweek	3	0	I'll... try.	[]
The Ghost of Human Kindness	19	0	Good. Then why don't you get into the back of my van, and I'll drive you home.	[]
Tweek	2	0	Your van?	[]
Officer 1	5	0	Alright Johnson, give it up!	[]

Tweek	1	0	No	[]
Detective	30	0	Then we aren't too late. His name is Frederick Johnson. He's been abducting children by dressing up like the Ghost of Human Kindness for over a year now.	[]
The Ghost of Human Kindness	17	0	And I would have gotten away with it again if it weren't for you meddling policemen!	[]
Liane	4	0	What's going on?	[]
Sharon	10	0	A stranger was caught trying to abduct the Tweak boy.	[]
Sheila	5	0	An abductor in our town?	[]

Sheila	9	0	Yes, we need a barrier to protect our kids.	[]
Townsfolk	6	0	Rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble...	[]
Randy	27	0	Wait, that's it. A wall. We could build a huge city wall all around South Park so that we have complete control over who comes in.	[]
Richard	9	0	That's... not a bad idea, a city wall.	[]
Sheila	8	0	But who can we get to build it?	[]
Mayor McDaniels	16	0	...And so, we want you to design and build a great wall, all around the city.	[]
City Wok Owner	11	0	I don' build wall. I just own un' operate City Wok.	[]
Gerald	24	0	We just think that you're the best person to put up a wall. We're sure you've got it in your blood.	[]
City Wok Owner	61	1	Oh, I get it. Just because I Chinese, you think I build wall. That i' bullshit! I'm not stereotype, okay?! Just because I'm Chinese doesn't mean I go around building wall! I'm just a normal person like all o'you! I eat ahrice and drive ahreally slow, just like the rest o'you! I'm not stereotype!	['bullshit']
Sharon	5	0	Please, Mr. Tuong Lu Kim.	[]

Randy	12	0	Stan, our abduction problems are over. We got the new Child Tracker.	[]
Stan	2	0	Child Tracker?	[]
Sharon	16	0	It's a little electrical device that can tell us where you are anywhere on Earth.	[]
Randy	16	0	If anybody takes you, we'll be able to locate your exact location within two meters.	[]
Randy	7	0	There, I think that's got it.	[]
Stan	9	0	...Dude, no way! I'm not wearing Child Tracker!	[]
Randy	9	0	You can barely even tell you have one on.	[]
Stan	15	0	I'm not going to school like this! What will all the other guys say?!	[]
Sharon	6	0	I wouldn't worry about that.	[]
Cartman	6	0	So weak. So weak, dude. Man.	[]
Kyle	17	0	Why did you go and have to be abducted, Tweek? Now all our parents are freaking out!	[]
Tweek	5	0	I didn't mean to.	[]
Tuong	80	9	Okay. Finary.  Oh no.  It's those God-damned Mongorians again! Stop! Stop right there, Mongorians!  God-damnit, stop!  Stop breaking down my city wall you stupid Mongoriaaans!

Kyle	7	0	But, wait. Where's the other team?	[]
Randy	5	0	There is no other team.	[]
Stan	1	0	Huh?	[]
Richard	30	0	Well, we've... put a wall around the city to keep outsiders out. You don't think we want a bunch of strangers coming in to play ball, do you?	[]
Stan	14	0	But if there is no other team, then it won't be any fun.	[]
Randy	10	0	Don't worry, it'll still be fun for us.	[]
Townsfolk	8	0	Go Cows! Go Cows! Go Cows! Go Cows!	[]
Jimbo	4	0	Play ball!  Steeeeee-riiike	[]
Townsfolk	3	0	Yeah! Woohoo! Yeah!	[]

Sharon	5	0	Congratulations on your victory, boys.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Dude, we weren't playing anybody.	[]
Randy	5	1	Yeah, and you kicked ass!	['ass']
Mr. Donovan	19	0	Isn't it awesome havin' a great wall around our city? Nobody in town except for our good friends.	[]
Townsfolk	7	0	Yeahah! Alright! Yeah. Right on! Right on!	[]
Richard	4	0	Guys! Sh, quiet everyone.	[]
News Anchor	15	0	And this newest study reveals more about child abductions than we apparently knew before, Tom.	[]
Sharon	3	0	Turn it up.	[]
Tom	49	0	That's right, Chris. This newest study shows that the majority of child abductions are NOT committed by strangers, but by somebody the child knows in their own town.  The report further states that it is because the child trusts the individual that problems occur in the first place.	[]
Chris	15	0	Well, I guess this means the enemy is in our own backyard, so to speak.	[]
Tom	3	0	Sure does, Tom.	[]
Chris	10	0	Alright, thanks, Chris. Is the weather going to turn su-	[]
Richard	14	0	Well, if you'll all excuse us, I think we'll be going now.	[]
Gerald	4	0	Yeah. Come along, Kyle	[]
Sharon	10	0	Stanley, time for us to get back to the house.	[]
Stan	7	0	I'm not done with my pizza.	[]
Sharon	2	0	NOW, Stanley!	[]
Tuong	100	2	Eh. Eh, eh, there we go.  All finished. My Mongolian Missile Defense system.  Those Mongolians try to break down my city wall again, they gonna get a big heat-seeking missile surprise!  Oh! Hello Mongolians. Yeah. You come to break down my city wall?  Oh, you gonna throw that baseball at my wall?  Oh no! Not a baseball! I'm pretty scared.  Well, you know what? I might have something here that's a little bigger than a baseball.  Say hello to my little friend!  Aw, crap.  Ooohhhh  God-damned Mongolians!! You break down my city wall foda last time!!	['crap', 'damned']
Stan	7	0	Dude, this is worse than Child Tracker.	[]
Richard	10	0	'Sokay, boys. Just act as if we weren't here.	[]
Sharon	7	0	Right. Do what you normally would do.	[]
Kyle	6	0	You're such a fatass, Cartman.	[]
Cartman	8	1	At least I'm not a stupid Jew.	['jew']
Sheila	3	0	What what whaaat?	[]
Mr. Mackey	22	0	M'kay, kids, so, now, who can tell me what year the first moon landing took place?  Uh, how about you, Clyde?	[]
Mr. Donovan	2	0	Nineteen six-	[]
Mr. Mackey	20	0	No helping!  M'kay, I'm not really sure havin' all the parents here is a good idea, m'kay?	[]
Richard	14	0	Well, maybe things could be better if we could trust people like the Stotches!	[]
Chris	10	0	Us? Your family's all be the shifty-eyed ones!	[]
Richard	2	0	Oh yeah?!	[]
Mr. Mackey	15	0	Oh, this is too much to take.  Mom, Dad, could you please leave me alone?	[]
Mr. Mackey's Father	11	0	We just wanna make sure nobody hurts you, Junior, m'kay?	[]
Mr. Mackey	2	0	M'kay.	[]
Tuong	162	1	Hahahaha! My masterpiece!  When those Mongolians come next time, I pour this sweet and sour pork on their heads. Haha, sweet and sour pork so hot and sticky, Mongolians'll stick ahright up to the wall! And scream UhwOoOoOoOoo! Oh I can't wait.  Oh, I get it. A Trojan Mongolian horse. Mongolians a-hiding inside thinking that I'll bring it in city wall, then Mongolians pop out and destroy wall from the inside out without gettin' any sweet and sour pork on their heads! Okay. I'll pray around.  Oh! Oh rook! Rook, my very own Mongorian Trojan horse! Gee, what a surprise! I guess Mongorians aren't such crappy, smelly people after all!  Yeah. Great! Rwow!  Yeah, what a great present! I'm just gonna push it inside the gate and soon tell all my friends.  Oh, it's sweet and sour pork!  Oh! I'm going to get you Nogodians, if it's the last thing I do!	['crappy']
News Anchor	31	1	And so all the residents of Manhattan are prepared to evacuate if Ms. Clinton's ass gets any bigger. And in other news, new findings on the increase in child abductions.	['ass']
Richard	6	0	Oh Jesus, turn it up, honey!	[]
News Anchor	47	0	The study shows that the most likely abductors of children... are the parents themselves!  The study reveals that nine out of every ten abduction cases are committed by the child's mother or father. The bottom line being that your children aren't safe, even from you!	[]
Richard	4	0	Where are you going?	[]
Mrs. Tweek	17	0	Uh. I'm just going to go upstairs and see if Tweek is still in his bed.	[]
Richard	8	0	Oh?  I think I'll go with you.	[]
Mrs. Tweek	7	0	It's okay. I can do it.	[]
Richard	8	0	I just want to make sure that you-	[]
Mrs. Tweek	17	0	That I don't abduct him? How do I know that you haven't done it already?	[]
Richard	7	0	Me? I would never abduct our son!	[]
Mrs. Tweek	8	0	That's not what the new study says!	[]
Richard	15	0	Well what are we supposed to do, eh-? How can we protect Tweek from ourselves?	[]
Randy	12	0	Here you go, Stanley. This should hold you over for three years.	[]
Stan	7	0	But why do I have to leave?	[]
Randy	25	0	The news says that at your age you aren't safe with us, son. You have to get out of here before we abduct you.	[]
Sharon	7	0	Good-bye, son.  Remember to eat right.	[]
Gerald	11	0	Look out for your brother, Kyle. You're the man now.	[]
Sheila	10	0	Oh, boys! Don't ever forget that we love you!	[]
Linda Stotch	4	0	Be careful out there!	[]
Stan	6	0	Where are we supposed to go?	[]
Randy	13	0	We can't tell you because we can't know where you are!	[]
Sheila	4	0	Oh, this is terrible!	[]
Mr. Donovan	10	0	Go on, kids! Go! Go and don't look back!	[]
Randy	8	0	Good-bye, kids. We'll... never forget you.	[]
Stan	9	0	Dude, sometimes I think our parents are really stupid.	[]

Tuong	26	0	Ah. Hey daw. O'er 'ere. O'er 'ere, dog. Got som'in sweet and souh foh ya.  Good dog! That's it! Keep licking, dog!	[]
Tuong	13	0	Hahahahahaaa! I'm free, Mongolians! And now I'm gonna make you PAY!	[]
News Anchor	28	0	Finally, some good news tonight. It's been several days since any child abductions have taken place. The main reason: parents don't know where their children are.	[]
Randy	4	0	What's the matter?	[]
Sharon	11	0	Oh, it's just... I was wondering if Stan's okay.	[]
Randy	12	0	Oh, I'm sure he's made it somewhere safe by now.	[]
Sharon	22	0	Do you really think we did the right thing, Randy? Sending all the young kids in town to live on their own?	[]
Randy	5	0	Sweetheart, you saw the news...	[]
Sharon	2	0	I know.	[]
Randy	31	0	Don't you worry. I'm sure that Stan and all the other kids are somewhere safe, off in a whole new city by now, making a new life for themselves.	[]

Tuong	7	1	God-damned Mongolians attacked city wall again!	['damned']
Man in Back	1	0	Mongolians?	[]
Randy	10	1	What the hell are they doin' here?! Rabble! Rabble rabble!	['hell']
Adults	4	0	Rabble rabble rabble rabble!	[]
Richard	8	0	Wait a minute. Those Mongolians are... our children.	[]
Sheila	2	0	Ike? Kyle?	[]
Sharon	8	0	My son has become a Mongolian? No! Noooo!!	[]
Richard	21	0	Oh God. What have we done? We sent our children away, and now they don't even remember who they are.	[]
Mr. Donovan	6	0	Kids? Don't you remember us?	[]
Randy	25	0	Wait wait. I learned some Mongolian in college.  Ah, let's see. Uh. K-kids, uh, Bi kute. Bi salnek kute. Uh-d tah tasobarro.	[]

Butters	6	0	Huh, I'm over here, Dad.	[]
Chris	1	0	Oh.	[]
Sheila	16	0	We're sorry, kids. We just let all those sensationalist news reports go to our heads.	[]
Richard	18	0	Oh my God, do you see what this means? The Ghost of Human Kindness was right all along.	[]
Mr. Donovan	15	0	You mean how he said we should trust each other, or how he abducted children?	[]
Richard	19	0	The uh... no, the part about being more trusting. We should follow what he said, not what he did.	[]
Adults	4	0	Wow, yeah. Oh yeah.	[]
Randy	37	0	No, no. You know who was right all along? The Mongolians.  They knew that you just can't wall yourself off from the outside world. Putting walls up never helps anything. Tearing them down brings us together.	[]
Adults	3	0	Whoa! Wow. Right!	[]
Chris	6	0	Yeah, the Mongolians were right. Yeah.	[]
Tuong	13	0	Aw, you'd better not say what I think you're gonna say.	[]
