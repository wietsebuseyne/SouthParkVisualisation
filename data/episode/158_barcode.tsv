Randy	20	0	...In my Easter Bonnet, with all the frills upon it, I'll be the grandest lady in the Easter parade.	[]
Randy	17	0	Look at that one, huh? Half purple and half yellow with a chikadee sticker. I'm good.	[]
Stan	11	0	Uh, can I ask a question? Why do we do this?	[]
Randy	13	0	Wha... what do you mean, Why do we do this? It's Easter!	[]
Stan	7	0	Right, so, why do we color eggs?	[]
Randy	9	0	Wulll, ssso that the Easter bunny can hide them.	[]
Stan	3	0	Yeah, but why?	[]
Randy	15	0	Stanley, Easter celebrates the day that Jesus was resurrected after being crucified for our sins.	[]
Stan	13	0	So we dip eggs in colored vinegar and a giant rabbit hides them?	[]
Randy	3	0	That's right.	[]
Stan	38	0	You don't see the missteps in logic with that?  Look, I'm just saying that somewhere between Jesus dying on the Cross and a giant bunny hiding eggs there seems to be a, a gap of information.	[]
Randy	6	1	Stanley, just dye your Goddamned eggs!	['goddamned']
Stan	12	0	I don't feel like coloring eggs! I don't get it!	[]
Randy	5	0	What is wrong with him?!	[]
Sharon	18	0	Well, he's just getting older, Randy. Maybe he's figured out the Easter bunny isn't real.	[]
Randy	4	0	You know so little!	[]
Cartman	23	0	And I want a Baltor soldier doll for Easter, and five Crash'n'Go RC cars, you got that?! Do you have that?!	[]
Mall Bunny	7	0	Ahh, don't you think that's-	[]
Cartman	32	1	Nono! You don't ask me questions! You are a rabbit! I am a human. So if you don't bring me what I want for Easter, I can fucking kill you!	['fucking']
Aide	1	0	Smile!	[]
Cartman	3	0	Bye, Easter bunny!	[]
Mall Bunny	3	0	Oh my God.	[]
Stan	11	0	All right, can you explain to me what's going on?	[]
Mall Bunny	1	0	Huh?	[]
Stan	44	0	What is the deal with the coloring the eggs and you hiding them and all that? What does that have to do with Jesus dying on the Cross?  It is symbolic? Are you trying to reference something that happened in Biblical times?  Answer me!	[]
Mall Bunny	14	0	Look, kid ahh, I'm j-, I'm just a guy in a costume.	[]
Stan	26	0	I know that! But I figure you must have some knowledge of what Easter's about if you're playing the Easter Bunny at the mall!	[]
Mall Bunny	11	0	Huhuh, Easter's just Easter. Just, just go with it, kid.	[]
Stan	19	0	No, I'm not gonna just go with it! I'm gonna find out what's behind all this!	[]
Mall Bunny	49	0	I need a break. Can I have a break?  We have a problem. Somebody's onto us. Yeah, he's askin' a lot of questions. Only a matter of time before he finds out what Easter's really about. Yes, I understand what must be done. Call the others.	[]
Stan	4	0	Mom? Dad?  Anybody home?	[]
Randy	8	0	Not now, Stanley, I'm on the toilet!	[]
Stan	6	0	Dad! You've gotta help me!	[]
Randy	7	1	Hang on, I'm taking a crap.	['crap']
Stan	7	0	Dad! There's Easter bunnies chasing me!	[]
Randy	1	0	What?	[]
Stan	22	0	They chased me from the mall! I don't know what they want!  They're coming in! Dad, open the door!  Dad?	[]
Randy	10	0	We... need to talk, Stan.  Ih, it's okay guys.	[]
Gray Hare	1	0	Randy?	[]
Randy	13	0	Yeah. 'Cause it turns out the kid we're after is my son.	[]
Purple Hare	1	0	Ohhh.	[]
Randy	13	0	Tell the Grand Hare everything is okay. I'll take it from here.	[]
Randy	25	0	I wanted to keep this from you, Stan. I really wanted to wait until you were older but... you just had to keep asking questions!	[]
Stan	8	0	Why were those other rabbit guys chasing me?!	[]
Randy	52	0	We have to be careful when we think somebody's onto us.  We are all part of a secret society, Stan. A very ancient, very important society of men who follow the way of the Rabbit, and protect the secret of the Easter bunny. We are called... the Hare Club For Men.	[]
Stan	5	0	Does Mom know about this?	[]
Randy	12	0	Duh, it's the Hare Club For Men. Chicks wouldn't understand.	[]
Stan	4	0	I don't understand!	[]
Randy	20	0	I belong to a secret society that has been around for thousands of years! Our identities have to be protected!	[]
Stan	8	0	Could, could you, take off, the ears, please?	[]
Randy	29	0	Stan, you don't seem to understand how serious this is! The secret of Easter that we protect is something that could rock the foundation of the entire world!	[]
Stan	7	0	So what is the secret of Easter?	[]
Randy	20	0	I can't tell you. You have to be allowed into the Society first, but... but perhaps... it's time.	[]
Randy	28	0	I always knew this day would come, when my son would be brought into the society. Reminds me of the day I was brought in by my father.	[]
Stan	5	0	Grandpa's in it too?	[]
Randy	20	0	Of course. Marshes have been in the Hare Club For Men for generations. All the way back to the beginning.	[]
Stan	14	0	Dad, do I have to wear this bag over my head the entire time?	[]
Randy	33	0	You aren't a member yet. You can't know where our secret meetings take place. We're going to a distant location, an old building near a lake about 40 minutes away.	[]
Stan	6	0	You mean the old Galveston Lodge?	[]
Randy	1	1	Dammit.	['dammit']
Hare 1	2	0	Hey Bill.	[]
Hare 2	2	0	Evenin' Marcus.	[]
Hare 3	6	0	Heh heh hey, look at you!	[]
Hare 4	2	0	Hey everybody.	[]
Hare 5	8	0	Stan Marsh, welcome! You must be very excited.	[]
Stan	2	0	Must I?	[]
Marvin	7	0	There he is! There's my grandson!	[]
Stan	2	0	Hi Grandpa.	[]
Marvin	6	0	I'm proud of ya, Billy.	[]
Stan	1	0	...Stan.	[]
Pink Hare	17	0	Tonight, we determine if a new member is worthy of protecting the Secret. Bring out... the rabbit.	[]
Hares	20	0	Sanctum Piter oteum, Deus ore uneum. Hippitus hoppitus reus homine. In suspiratoreum, lepus in re sanctum. Hippitus hoppitus Deus Domine.	[]
Pink Hare	6	0	All hail the cute rabbit, Snowball!	[]
Hares	2	0	Hail Snowball.	[]
Pink Hare	11	0	Stan Marsh, are you ready to hear the secret of Easter?	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Randy	20	0	Are you sure, son? Once you hear the secret, you will be bound to The Hare Club For Men forever.	[]
Stan	5	0	Yeah, I wanna know already.	[]
Pink Hare	17	0	Very well. At the Last Supper, Jesus Christ met with his 12 Disciples. It was there that-	[]
Gray Hare	3	0	They found us!	[]
White Hare	2	0	Protect Snowball!	[]
Brown Hare	3	0	They're everywhere!	[]
Randy	14	0	Come on, we've gotta go!  Stan, take Snowball and get out of here!	[]
Stan	6	0	Where am I supposed to go?	[]
Randy	5	0	Just get out of here!	[]
Layman	4	0	Where is the rabbit?!	[]
Hare 6	5	0	Where are you taking us?	[]
Hare 7	6	0	No! I'm not goin' anywhere!	[]
Stan	2	0	Jesus Christ!	[]
Layman	17	0	Who did you give the rabbit to?!  Search the area! The boy could not have gotten far!	[]
Stan	2	0	Oh no...	[]
Stan	1	0	Help.	[]
Kyle	2	0	What happened?	[]
Stan	39	0	My Dad's in a rabbit-worshiping cult called the Hare Club For Men they protect the secret of Easter but before they said what it was they were attacked by ninjas and put me in charge of Snowball.	[]
Kyle	8	0	...I'm kind of finger painting right now.	[]
Stan	37	0	Dude, they took my Dad away. They even shot one of his fellow hares. And now they're after me!  Do you know anything about Easter? What is the connection between Jesus and rabbits and colored eggs?	[]
Kyle	8	1	Dude, I'm Jewish. I have no idea.	['jewish']
Randy	5	0	Nelson.  Nelson? Nelson, say something.	[]
Nelson	8	0	My legs. I... I think they're broken.	[]
Randy	12	0	Nelson, do you know where we are? Where did they take us?	[]
Nelson	10	0	Don't know... we traveled for hours... kept blacking out...	[]
Randy	1	0	You...	[]
Kyle	10	0	Hi, we'd like to speak to a  Professor Teabag?	[]
Butler	6	0	What is it in regard to?	[]
Kyle	4	0	The history of Easter.	[]
Teabag	13	0	Sorry boys, it's a little late for me to be giving lectures.	[]
Stan	11	0	Please? Do you know anything about the Hare Club For Men?	[]
Teabag	7	0	The Keepers?  The Guardians of the Secret?	[]
Stan	10	0	My Dad is in it. This... rabbit is too somehow.	[]
Teabag	3	0	Come on in.	[]
Teabag	45	0	The Hare Club For Men has been around for centuries. One of its most famous members was Leonardo da Vinci.  Behold the Last Supper. The dinner Christ had with his disciples the night before he was crucified. What food do you see on the table?	[]
Stan	2	0	Just bread...	[]
Teabag	17	0	Really? Look to Jesus's right.  The food which is a little different color than the others.	[]
Kyle	7	0	It kind of looks like... an egg.	[]
Teabag	14	0	Yes. The egg marks the secret. It lies directly in front of...  Saint Peter.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Who is Saint Peter?	[]
Stan	11	0	He was the disciple that Jesus made into the first pope.	[]
Teabag	25	0	Eggsactly. But there's something the Church didn't tell you. In actuality, Peter wasn't a man at all. Saint Peter... was a rabbit.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Peter Rabbit.	[]
Teabag	27	0	Of course, the Church wouldn't allow da Vinci to paint Peter as a rabbit, so he painted him as a man, but left clues. Look closely.	[]
Kyle	5	0	I don't see it.	[]
Teabag	2	0	Look closelier.	[]
Stan	5	0	He looks like a guy.	[]
Teabag	28	0	Look more closelier.  With laser technology we can look beneath the paint, the way da Vinci originally painted it.  That... is Saint Peter.  The original Pope of Christianity.	[]
Kyle	5	0	I don't believe it.	[]
Teabag	22	0	Proof is everywhere. Look at the Pope's hat.  It makes no sense, except that it was originally designed...  for a rabbit.	[]
Stan	11	0	But why would Jesus want a rabbit to run his church?	[]
Teabag	54	0	Because Jesus knew no one man could speak for everyone in a religion. Men can be intolerant; rabbits are pure. But the Catholic Church buried the truth, put a man in charge, and the Hare Club For Men has been decorating eggs ever since to keep the secret in da Vinci's painting alive.	[]
Kyle	7	0	So... the Vatican took Stan's dad?	[]
Pope Benedict	13	0	You dare to mock God by telling people St. Peter was a rabbit?	[]
Randy	10	0	You monster! You have no right to wear that hat!	[]
Pope Benedict	22	1	Trying to tell people that St. Peter was a rabbit is blasphemy! You must admit you are wrong or burn in hell!	['hell']
Randy	16	0	It's saying stupid things like that that made Jesus wanna put a rabbit in charge.	[]
Layman	18	0	I'm sorry I couldn't bring you the rabbit, Your Holiness, but they know where it is!	[]
Pope Benedict	16	0	The rabbit you call Snowball is a threat to Christ's Church. Where is the rabbit?!	[]
Randy	24	0	I don't know! And even if I did know... well, I'd probably tell you because I don't wanna be here anymore.	[]
Layman	5	0	Take him to be tortured!	[]
Pope Benedict	16	0	Tortured, huh, but Bill, all this... torturing and ninjas, it just doesn't seem very Christian.	[]
Bill	17	0	You asked for the help of the American Catholic League, let us do our job! Take him!	[]
Randy	10	1	No! No, you bunny-hating bastards! Don't do this!	['bastards']
Stan	16	0	I don't get it. Why would the pope be holding my Dad hostage for Snowball?	[]
Teabag	22	0	I believe Snowball must be a direct descendant of St. Peter himself, and therefor the true heir of the pope's throne.	[]
Butler	4	0	Mr. Teabag! Get out!	[]
Stan	3	0	They found me!	[]
Teabag	17	0	Boys, get out of here!  Head to the woods! I'll try to buy you some time.	[]
Bill	7	0	Check upstairs!  Upstairs clear! Try the office!	[]
Ninja 1	2	0	In here!	[]
Ninja 2	3	0	What's that?	[]
Ninja 1	1	0	PEEEEPS!	[]
Kyle	3	0	So what now?	[]
Stan	14	0	If the pope has my Dad... I have to give him what he wants.	[]
Kyle	8	0	You aren't just gonna hand Snowball over?	[]
Stan	61	0	What choice do I have?! There's nobody left who can help us!  Wait... unless... maybe there is.  Here, hold this.  Jesus, I know we haven't talked in a long time, and I know that every time you appear we end up killing you somehow, but... I don't know what to do. And I could really use your help.	[]
Kyle	9	1	I think the rabbit just crapped on my jacket.	['crapped']
Announcer	10	0	Live, from the Vatican, it's our Easter Vigil coverage.	[]
Reporter	47	0	As Holy Saturday comes to an end, the Easter vigil at the Vatican begins. Thousand have turned out to hear the Pope and celebrate the Resurrection.  For this Easter vigil the Pope is also showing his divine grace by feeding the poor, with a massive rabbit stew.	[]
Violet Hare	8	0	NOOO! Noo! No, don't put m-  AAAAAAAAAAH!	[]
Pope Benedict	4	0	Bill, this seems extreme.	[]
Bill	24	0	The child who has the rabbit has to know that we are willing to kill the hostages if he doesn't hand it over.	[]
Italian Cardinal	10	0	Your Holiness, a child has arrived with a the rabbit!	[]
Bill	2	0	Ya see?	[]
Randy	16	0	Oh thank God! Hand it over, Stan! They're gonna kill me! Give them the rabbit!	[]
Pope Benedict	4	0	Yes, hand it over!	[]
Stan	17	0	First, you have to promise you won't hurt it! And that you'll let everybody go!	[]
Pope Benedict	2	0	We promise.	[]
Bill	6	0	We swear it, on the cross.	[]
Randy	6	0	Just hand over the bunny, Stan!	[]
Stan	2	0	Okay, fine.	[]
Randy	14	0	Stanley, why did you do that? I would have proudly died for that rabbit.	[]
Stan	6	0	You said hand over the bunny.	[]
Randy	10	0	No! That is not the way we're remembering it!	[]
Bill	4	0	Take them into custody!	[]
Stan	4	1	Hey, what the hell!	['hell']
Pope Benedict	10	0	Bill, we have zeh rabbit, it's all we need.	[]
Bill	15	1	Don't be soft, Your Holiness! These whores must be punished in front of everyone!	['whores']
Kyle	6	1	You swore on the cross, fatso!	['fatso']
Bill	10	0	Yeah. Too bad for you... it was a double cross!	[]
Randy	7	0	Oh, we should've seen that coming!	[]
Pope Benedict	12	0	Bill, I'm not sure that double-crossing people is very Christian.	[]
Bill	7	0	It is what Christ would've wanted!	[]
Jesus	6	0	Who are you to say that?!	[]
Pope Benedict	4	0	It... can't be.	[]
"Stan, Kyle"	1	0	Jesus!	[]
Singer	19	0	He is risen. He is risen. Let the voices sing his praises on this holy day. He is risen!	[]
Cardinal	7	0	Jesus, we thought you died. In Iraq.	[]
Jesus	20	0	I have the power of resurrection. Or have you forgotten? You all seem to have forgotten a lot of things.	[]
Stan	6	0	Jesus, you did answer my prayer!	[]
Jesus	9	0	Actually, I was answering the prayer of Nick Donovan.	[]
Purple Hare 2	5	0	Ohh, that's me Neato!	[]
Jesus	32	0	This is exactly why I put a rabbit in charge of the Church, Benedictus! Because men are so easily led astray. St. Peter was a rabbit. And a rabbit should be Pope.	[]
Bill	2	0	Kill him!	[]
Pope Benedict	1	0	What?!	[]
Bill	8	0	He goes against the Church. He must die!	[]
Pope Benedict	17	0	All right, that does it, Bill. I'm pretty sure that killing Jesus is not very Christian.	[]
Bill	11	0	You are soft! Weak! You leave me no choice: take them!	[]
Jesus	4	0	What are you doing?!	[]
Pope Benedict	4	0	I am the Pope!	[]
Bill	34	0	You are no longer able to fulfill your duties to the Lord!  The Easter vigil will go on as planned!  Every Hare Club member, young and old, will watch as their precious savior dies!	[]
Jesus	5	0	What is your problem, guy?!	[]
Bill	11	1	Lock up those two Jews!  We'll deal with them later.	['jews']
Stan	2	0	No! No!	[]
Reporter	22	0	A strange turn of events here at the Vatican: Pope Benedictus has stepped down, ushering the new era of... Pope Bill Donohue	[]
Bill	16	0	My people! This Easter I'm gonna start by making our rabbit stew ten times meatier!	[]
Randy	7	0	No! Listen! We aren't rabbits!  Oof.	[]
Pope Benedict	3	0	Forgive me, Jesus.	[]
Jesus	10	0	We'll never get out in time to stop him!	[]
Kyle	6	0	Don't you have any superpowers?	[]
Jesus	24	0	Not as a mortal. Only in death. Wait. That's it. We have no choice, Kyle. You're going to have to kill me.	[]
Kyle	1	0	What?	[]
Jesus	13	0	Stab me with this.  If I die I can resurrect outside the bars.	[]
Kyle	6	0	N-no way! Do it yourself.	[]
Jesus	9	0	Suicide is blasphemy. There's no choice here, Kyle!	[]
Kyle	18	1	Dude, you don't understand, I'm a Jew. I have a few hang ups about killing Jesus.	['jew']
Jesus	12	0	Just make it quick.  Through the neck. I'll arise again immediately.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Don't make me do this.	[]
Jesus	8	0	My son, there is no time! Do it!	[]
Kyle	7	0	Eric Cartman can never know about this.	[]
Jesus	6	0	I understand. And Kyle, happy Easter.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Happy Easter, Jesus.	[]
Jesus	1	0	Awgh!	[]
Kyle	1	0	...Jesus?	[]
Bill	14	0	Behold, no longer will Easter be about bunnies and colored eggs! Kill the rabbit!	[]
Cardinal	3	0	Sorry, little bunny.	[]
Stan	1	0	Snowball!	[]
Tourist	1	0	Jesus?	[]
Jesus	7	0	Stop! That rabbit is of holy descent!	[]
Bill	6	0	Why won't you go away?!	[]
Jesus	9	0	One man cannot be the voice of the Church!	[]
Bill	17	0	Enough of this blasphemy! I'm the Pope now! That means I am the voice of God!	[]
Jesus	9	0	Not anymore. I'm removing you from your position.	[]
Crowd	1	0	YAAAY!	[]
Stan	3	0	All right Jesus!	[]
Crowd	10	0	Sanctum Piter oteum, Deus ore uneum. Hippitus hoppitus reus homine.	[]
Cardinal	19	0	Your Holiness, what should we tell the world about how to run their lives?  It isn't saying anything.	[]
Italian Cardinal	7	0	Yes, just as a-Jesus intended it.	[]
Randy	15	0	Stanley, I'm so proud of you. You've learned so very much this Easter.	[]
Stan	17	0	Yeah. I've learned not to ask questions. Just dye the eggs and keep my mouth shut.	[]
Randy	4	0	That's my boy.	[]
Crowd	10	0	In suspiratoreum, lepus in re sanctum. Hippitus hoppitus Deus Domine.	[]
