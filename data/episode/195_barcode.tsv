Butters	16	0	What do you guys wanna do first? I hear they have a new inner tube slide.	[]
Cartman	22	0	No! Dude, we gotta go to the wave pool first. It's so dope, as long as there aren't any minorities.	[]
Jimmy	7	0	Wha-what are you talking about, Eric?	[]
Cartman	21	0	You know, there's always like five or six minorities wearing their T-shirts in the wave pool, pisses me off.	[]
Stan	8	0	We're here! It's the water park!	[]

Butters	4	0	You said go ahead.	[]
Stan	10	0	Come on Kyle, let's go check out the fireboat.	[]
Kyle	7	0	No dude, Butters' pee is in there.	[]
Stan	18	0	Aw come on, look at all this water. It doesn't matter if one person pees in it.	[]
Butters	20	0	Yeah, come on, Kyle, I'm not the only person who's peed in the pool. Lots of people do.	[]
Kyle	4	0	No they don't!	[]
Stan	4	0	Yeah, they do, Kyle.	[]
Jimmy	14	0	To be perfectly frank, I peed in the pool about tututwenty five seconds ago.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Dude!	[]
Stan	11	0	Come on, show us how long you can hold your breath.	[]
Kyle	1	0	NO!	[]
Cartman	151	0	What has happened to this place? I don't recognize it anymore. It used to be so fun and special. What is life worth living for? The dream is dead, our land is gone; There's a hole in my heart and I can't go on. There are too many minorities (minorities) At my water park (my water park). This was our land, our dream (our dream), and they've taken it all away. They just keep coming and coming (minorities). I tried to go and tell the police, But even the authorities Are minorities At my water park. There's no place for me to sit anymore, And the lines just keep getting crazier. There are Mexicans all around me. The lazy river has never been lazier. It's a 40 minute wait to go down one slide, And the instructions are in Spanish on the Zip Line ride!	[]
Ride operator	8	0	Guarden los brazos y piernas dentro del paseo-	[]
Cartman	5	0	Just do it in English!	[]
Cartman	96	0	There are too many minorities (too many) At my water park (somebody do something). Where did they all come from? Why can't they leave this land alone? And it's such a tragedy (feel a bit like dying). We looked the other way too long. We've got to change our priorities And get all these minorities Out of my water park (Minorities) Mexicans and Asians, (Black people), I think I even saw a Native American (gross). God I'm asking please, get all of these minorities Out of my water park (my water park).	[]
Stan	9	0	After this, you guys wanna hit the hurricane slides?	[]
Butters	2	0	You bet!	[]
Kyle	8	0	I'm not getting back in the water.	[]
Stan	4	0	Aw come on, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	15	0	Dude, I just found out that everybody pees in pools. Why would I go back?	[]
Stan	5	0	Not everybody pees in pools.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Do you pee in the pool?	[]
Stan	3	0	Not today... yet.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Aw, come on!	[]
Stan	16	0	Well dude, what are you gonna do? Just hang out here at the table all day?	[]
Kyle	2	0	Most likely.	[]
Cartman	11	0	You guys! You guys, we have got problems of Biblical proportions!	[]
Stan	5	0	Dude, where have you been?	[]
Cartman	24	0	I've been counting. Do you know there are two hundred and five Mexicans here? and there are a hundred and ninety black people!	[]
Kyle	2	0	So what?	[]
Cartman	25	0	So?! Guess how many white people are at the water park today? One hundred and forty three! There are actually more minorities here than us!	[]
Kyle	8	0	Well then they're not minorities, are they?	[]
Cartman	4	0	...What do you mean?	[]
Kyle	18	1	Dumbass, if there's sixty percent of them to forty percent of us, then who's the minority?!	['dumbass']
Cartman	5	0	The black and brown people.	[]
Kyle	5	0	No, you're the minority!	[]
Cartman	36	0	Do I look like a minority to you, stupid?! Now look guys, I did some calculations: just last year, there were almost ninety percent normal people to minorities. That's fifty percent rise in one, year!	[]
Stan	11	0	This is more math than I've ever seen you do.	[]
Cartman	28	0	Because it's important! A fifty percent rise each year means that in three years the world will be only... minorities. That's 2012! The Mayans predicted this!	[]
Butters	2	0	The who?	[]
Cartman	20	0	The Mayans! They knew that minorities would take over the world by the year 2012! And now it's happening!	[]
Stan	7	0	I'm gonna go on the slides.	[]
Butters	1	0	Whoopie!	[]
Cartman	42	0	You guys! You guys have to do something to stop this! Come on!  Well, looks like at least you've got some sense left in you, Kyle. So what are we gonna do to keep the Mayan prediction from coming true, buddy?	[]
Kyle	6	1	Blow it out your ass, Cartman!	['ass']
Elderly Woman	11	0	Eugene, that is disgusting! Did you just pee in the pool?	[]
Elderly Man	19	0	Aw, come on, look how big this pool is. One person peeing in it isn't gonna hurt anything.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Eewww!	[]
Water Tester	3	0	Oh my God.	[]
Pi Pi	12	0	Ah, gentlemen, I am da Pi Pi. How can I heelp you.	[]
Assistant	11	0	Pi Pi, we have some dire news concerning your water park.	[]
Water Tester	17	0	I've just finished some tests. The water in your park is now ninety eight percent pee.	[]
Pi Pi	6	0	Yes, uhso whatsuh is the problem?	[]
Assistant	21	0	Pi Pi, you know that acceptable pee levels in any water park is eighty three percent.  You have to shut down.	[]
Pi Pi	17	0	What?! I can'tuh close down now, it'she my biggesteh weekend. Everyone is having uhtheh fun.	[]
Water Tester	21	0	You're endangering people's lives!  If those pee levels hit a hundred percent, there's no telling what'll happen!	[]
Lawyer	13	0	And what proof... do you have that the pee levels will go up?	[]
Water Tester	49	0	One in three people admit they pee in pools. Add another for people who do but don't admit it; that's two in three. You've got just over five hundred people out there; that's three hundred and thirty two people about to pee in your water!	[]
Pi Pi	56	0	Gehntlemen, pleaseh. I come-a from ada Venice.  Venice is almost all pee. And we doin' just fine. We swim-a in the pee, we sing-a in the pee. You can't barge in here and tell me thuh, that I have to close down just because my wahter park has-a too much pee.	[]
Water Tester	6	0	You have to evacuate people now!	[]
Lawyer	25	0	He said he's not doing it! And as his lawyer I advise you gentlemen to leave and take your wild pee theories with you!	[]
Water Tester	23	0	If one more person urinates in your pool, it could set off a chain reaction. Then the pee will be on your hands.	[]
Butters	9	0	Oh b-hoy, the waves are startin' up again!	[]
Stan	5	0	This is sweet, huh Kenny?	[]
Jimmy	4	0	What what's that?	[]
Man 1	3	0	It's pee!	[]
Man 2	5	0	Look out for the pee!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Aaaaah! Gross!	[]
Pi Pi	6	0	Aaaaa, it's-a the peeee!	[]
Floating Man	1	0	Aaaah!	[]
Stan	7	0	Aaaah!  Oh my God, they killed Kenny!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Aw, sick!	[]
Fire Marshal	14	0	I want that entire water park contained and quarantined until I get some answers.	[]
Randy	4	0	What's going on?	[]
Fire Marshal	8	0	I told you people to keep civilians back!	[]
Randy	10	0	Sir, please, my son is in there! What's happened?	[]
Fire Marshal	30	0	We don't know yet, all right?! There's been a pee breach and a lot of people are dead. Now I'm sorry, but you're gonna have to-	[]
Officer 1	9	0	Captain, these two men claim to know the situation.	[]
Water Tester	16	0	We warned the owner of the park, but he refused to shut down. This was inevitable.	[]
Fire Marshal	6	0	So this is all pee-related.	[]
Water Tester	8	0	Yes, I... tested the pH levels this morning.	[]
Fire Marshal	1	0	And?	[]
Water Tester	7	0	It was almost all pee, no H.	[]
Randy	8	0	Oh my God. I've gotta help him!	[]
Fire Marshal	2	0	Stay back!	[]
Randy	13	0	You can't just leave my son in there with all that pee!	[]
Officer 2	13	0	Sir, it's possible with the crane we could help any survivors out.	[]
Water Tester	9	0	I think that would be a very bad idea.	[]
Fire Marshal	4	0	And why is that?	[]
Water Tester	21	0	Anyone inside there is contaminated. We have reason to believe that when people are exposed to that much pee, they... change.	[]
Fireman 1	2	0	Change how?	[]
Water Tester	31	0	All right uh brubring in, bring in the monkey.  We've only tested the theory on monkeys so far. This monkey is healthy and normal in every way, but now, watch.	[]
Fire Marshal	8	0	My God, he's become full of rage!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Aahhh...	[]
Stan	9	0	Kyle, quick! You've gotta swim over to us!	[]
Kyle	2	0	No way!	[]
Jimmy	7	0	You've gotta swim over here, Kyle.	[]
Butters	3	0	Come on, Kyle!	[]
Kyle	5	0	Dude, that's all pee!	[]
Stan	11	0	Well if you don't swim in you're gonna die!	[]
Kyle	9	0	I'll die if I do swim in it!	[]
Stan	12	0	Kyle, it's just pee! It's not that big a deal!	[]
Kyle	20	0	Yes it is a big deal! Why do you think everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom?!	[]
Stan	12	0	...Well, not everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom.	[]
Kyle	1	0	...What?!	[]
Stan	7	0	Come on, dude, you've gotta swim.	[]
Kyle	11	0	You don't wash your hands after going to the bathroom!	[]
Stan	4	0	Not... all the time.	[]
Kyle	3	0	That is gross!!	[]
Stan	23	0	Why? It's not like you're peeing on your hands! There's more germs on most furniture than there is in pee!	[]
Butters	13	0	Yeah, if anything you should wash your hands before you touch your weiner!	[]
Stan	3	0	Kyle, come on!	[]
Kyle	8	1	Ha, Goddamnit!  Haaa. Ohhhh. Ahh, ohh, uhh, agh,	['goddamnit']
Butters	7	0	Do you need to wash your hands?	[]
Cartman	2	0	Help! Help!	[]
Man 1	6	0	Here! Hey kid, grab this stick!	[]
Cartman	21	0	Yes! Yes help me! Yes, help me I'm just a little boy! You have to help me!  Oh, oh, oh.	[]
Man 2	3	0	Are you okay?	[]
Cartman	5	0	Haa-aa. Yes, thank you.	[]
Man 2	7	0	Well what are we gonna do now?	[]
Woman 1	7	0	We've gotta just wait it out.	[]
Woman 2	5	0	Yeah, but for how long?	[]
Man 3	8	0	We need to find somethin' to paddle with.	[]
Cartman	85	0	Day one. It has happened. The Mayans were right. The only thing they got wrong was the date. It is 2009, and I appear to be the last of my species alive. Now it's just me, all alone, with minorities. What will the minorities do with me? I'm sure that's what on all of their minds. I have to make myself seem useful to them or they will surely not let me live.  Does anyone need medical help? I am a doctor.	[]
Sharon	12	0	Randy, Randy, calm down. I can't understand what you're saying.	[]
Randy	15	0	It's the pee!  It's all pee, and nobody can go in or out!	[]
Sharon	4	0	What is all pee?	[]
Randy	16	0	Sharon, the water park had a pee meltdown! They think a lot of people have died.	[]
Sharon	7	0	What?! What about Stan?! Is he okay?!	[]
Randy	26	0	I don't know! The whole water park has been quarantined! They're worried anyone left alive could be... sssome kind of raging, hate-filled mutants.	[]
Sharon	7	0	Randy, you've got to do something!	[]
Randy	36	0	Calm down, Sharon, all right?!  Calm down! They're trying to find an antidote. Once they believe they can neutralize the enraging effects of the pee, they'll, they'll go in to look for survivors.	[]
Fire Marshal	28	1	I said keep the media out! If the public hears about this we'll have a full-scale panic on our hands!  Damn it where is that antidote?!	['damn']
Researcher 1	40	0	Here! Here! We think we have it, sir!  It's the best we could come up with in such a short time! We aren't sure of the ramifications, but it does appear to neutralize some particles of the urine.	[]
Fire Marshal	10	0	All right, let's test it. Bring in the monkeys!	[]
Water Tester	11	1	Let's hope to Christ this works.  No, damn it, no!	['damn']
Fire Marshal	4	0	They're still angry.	[]
Researcher 1	5	0	This one's really angry.	[]
Fire Marshal	10	0	It's out of control!  Find an antidote that works!	[]
Kyle	9	0	Dude, why aren't people coming to help us?	[]
Stan	4	0	I don't know.	[]
Pi Pi	24	0	Why? Why didn't Pi Pi leesten? They tried to warn-a the Pi Pi, but-a the Pi Pi not-a belieeve them.	[]
Stan	3	0	Who are you?	[]
Pi Pi	29	0	Oh I, I'm so sohhry. This all-eh my fault. I should've-a shut my water park-a down when it reached-a ninety percent-a pee.	[]
Kyle	11	0	Yeah, well people should  know that peeing in pools is  bad!	[]
Pi Pi	37	0	But wait-a. Maybe you boys-a can help-a Pi Pi. In-a the maintenance room-a there's the emergency release-a valve-a. If you open the door then the pee can be lowered.	[]
Jimmy	7	0	Okay, w-where's the maintenance room?	[]
Pi Pi	60	0	That is-a the problem. The maintenance room is a way down on the basement-a level. I would do it but-a Pi Pi is-a no good at-a swimming. Somebody will have to dive-a down into the pee, then stay there to turn the release-a wheel. So, who can hold their breath-a the longest?	[]
Kyle	1	0	No.	[]
Butters	10	0	You said you could hold your breath the longest, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Not in pee!	[]
Pi Pi	34	0	Please-a you have to hurry!  I'll draw you-a the map, and instructions how to shut off-a the valve-a. It'll be as easy as-a peeing in the shower.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Oh who pees in the shower?	[]
Stan	18	0	...Well, it's not like you suddenly have to pee, you're gonna get out of the shower.	[]
Butters	13	0	Well yeah, seeing all that running water makes me always need to pee.	[]
Kyle	12	1	You don't pee in the shower, dude, that's fucking disgusting!	['fucking']
Pi Pi	25	0	Boys-a please-a, we've got to get this-a boy to the drainage-a valve-a or we're all-a gonna die!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Jesus Christ!	[]
Cartman	60	0	It has been many, many hours since the Apocalypse, and all I keep thinking is Why me? Why am I the only one of my race God chose to survive in this minority-run world? When the smoke has cleared I'm sure the minorities will start rebuilding, building the world... in their way. I can see it now. Nooo...	[]
Teacher	10	0	All right, Eric Cartman, let's hear your book report.	[]
Cartman	14	0	I read Treasure Island, because I was so happy when I saw that movie.	[]
Teacher	13	0	Hey! You're living in a minority-speaking country now! Say it right!	[]
Cartman	10	0	...because I was so happy when I seen that movie.	[]
Teacher	1	0	Good.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Noooo...  Trying to find a job will be even harder.	[]
Senor Lopez	16	0	You don't expect to make the same amount of money that minorities make, do ya?	[]
Cartman	7	0	Well, I do just as much work.	[]
Senor Lopez	14	0	You're trash around here. You'll never make as much as a minority.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Noooo...  Eventually the minorities will do away with me altogether.	[]
Coucilman	10	0	All those in favor of putting white people in camps?	[]
Audience	1	0	Aye!	[]
Coucilman	3	0	All those opposed?	[]
Cartman	1	0	Noooo...	[]
Coucilman	3	0	The minorities win!	[]
Cartman	30	0	NO! No I don't wanna live in your world, do you understand?! Your world is cold and devoid of any humanity! Just kill me! Kill me now! DO IT!	[]
Pi Pi	41	0	Okay, there. We are almost-a ready for the diving-a. Now if you run into any da problems you just tug-a three times on the cable and the Pi Pi will-a pull you back-a to the surface.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Let's just get this over with!	[]
Pi Pi	12	0	You've got-a the map and-a Pi Pi's instructions?	[]
Kyle	1	0	Yes.	[]
Pi Pi	14	0	Good-a. Now just one last thing.  You need to drink-a some pee.	[]
Kyle	1	0	What?!	[]
Pi Pi	11	0	You just need to drink about-a three cups of pee.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Why?!	[]
Pi Pi	29	0	You swim-a down deep in the pee, you get-a the pressure, the bendza. You have to fill-a inside your body with some-a pee to compensate.	[]
Stan	10	0	That's true dude, didn't you see The Abyss?	[]
Kyle	7	0	I am not, not, d-rinking pee!	[]
Pi Pi	37	0	But only you can hold-a the breath a long time, just swim down and-a release the valve! If-eh you don't you get-a the benza, then you fail and we all-a die!	[]
Stan	5	0	Just drink the pee, Kyle.	[]
Butters	6	0	Please, Kyle, I wanna go home.	[]
Pi Pi	46	0	What's-a the problem? When-a you pee either in the toilet or in the shower it all goes to the sewer. The sewer all goes-a to the ocean, the ocean is the water we all drink, we are always drinking-a the pee!	[]
Kyle	17	0	That doesn't make me feel better! I wouldn't even be able to keep it down.	[]
Pi Pi	19	0	Sure you will, you drank only pee for nine months when you lived-a in your mother's belly.	[]
Kyle	1	0	No!	[]
Water Tester	46	0	Make way! Make way! I need to speak to the fire marshal! Sir! Sir, I just got off the phone with my colleagues at the university! They've also been testing antidotes on monkeys! They're claiming that they've had success using simple Musa acuminata.	[]
Researcher 2	5	0	Wait, you mean a banana.	[]
Water Tester	1	0	Yes.	[]
Fire Marshal	18	0	Is it possible... the antidote is something as simple as a banana? Get another monkey!  All right, Connors.	[]
Fireman 2	4	0	Holy God, it works!	[]
Police Captain	10	0	All right, let's start moving in, everyone! Check the-	[]
Water Tester	19	0	Hold on, ih it is a promising lead, but this antidote hasn't yet been tested on a human.	[]
Randy	11	0	I'll do it.  You can test the antidote on me.	[]
Fire Marshal	7	0	You sure you want to do this?	[]
Randy	13	0	Give me the banana.  Ugh. Awgh. Aaagh! Awwwwgh! Awwgh, wagh.  Aww, ooogh, Aaaaaaaah.	[]
Researcher 3	3	0	He looks agitated...	[]
Randy	3	0	Aaaaaahhh. Aw, awww.	[]
Fire Marshal	7	0	He's losin' it! Stevens, your gun!	[]
Randy	9	0	No, wait, wait! Ugh. Eugh. I... I'm okay.	[]
Water Tester	4	0	He's all right!	[]
Fireman 3	3	0	The banana worked!	[]
Stan	3	0	Come on, dude!	[]
Kyle	5	0	I'm thinking about it!	[]
Jimmy	14	0	Well it's probably bu-better if you don't think about it, Kyle.	[]
Pi Pi	14	0	There's no more time-a. You have to drink-a the pee NOW!	[]
Kyle	3	0	Gah, ah.  Gaagh.	[]
Pi Pi	10	0	Come on, you have to drink aaall-a the peeeee.	[]
Butters	5	0	You can do it, Kyle!	[]
Kyle	3	0	Aaahh. Well-  AAAAH!	[]
Pi Pi	15	0	All right, now you can open the release-a valve. Okay, so let's-a	[]
Butters	2	0	Hey look!	[]
Randy	1	0	Stan!	[]
Stan	7	0	All right, they finally came for us.	[]
Kyle	5	1	Are you fucking kidding me?!	['fucking']
Randy	11	0	Wait here a minute, Stan, I'm gonna call your mother.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Guys? Guys!  Oh it's true! You all did survive!	[]
Butters	3	0	Hawww, you lived?	[]
Cartman	22	0	Oh my God, you guys! I really thought I was the only non-minority on Earth! How many of our species survived?	[]
Kyle	9	0	That wasn't the Mayan apocalypse, you racist idiot!	[]
Cartman	30	0	It wasn't? So then, you mean... we do have until 2012. Well, it may be only three years, but... I intend to live those precious years to the fullest!	[]
Kyle	15	0	Will somebody just get me to a hospital? I need to get my stomach pumped!	[]
Stan	10	0	Aw come on, it was just a little pee, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	26	1	Goddamnit, don't you get it?! I hate pee! I'm grossed out by pee! The only thing I find more disgusting than pee is bananas!	['goddamnit']
Water Tester	7	0	All right everyone, quick! Here you go!	[]
Butters	3	0	What's this?	[]
Fire Marshal	8	0	You all need to eat your banana immediately!	[]
Kyle	4	1	What the hell for?!	['hell']
Stevens	10	0	Eat the banana or we have to put you down!	[]
Kyle	1	0	AAAAAAAA!	[]
