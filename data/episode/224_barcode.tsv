Stan	10	0	Throw it here! Throw it here!  Yeah! Nice one, Clyde!	[]
Betsy	7	0	Clyde! Clyde! Clyde, get up here! Hurry!	[]
Betsy	3	0	What is that?	[]
Clyde	2	0	A toilet?	[]
Betsy	31	0	That's right. It's a toilet, Clyde. And where is the toilet seat? It's up, because you left it up, again! We've been through this countless times, Clyde.	[]
Clyde	10	0	Okay mom, just not in front of my friends okay?	[]
Betsy	28	0	No, not okay. Because you aren't getting the message! What if I'd fallen in? Start listening to me! Put it down! Put it down!  Thank you.	[]
Cartman	27	0	Dude, that sucks, Clyde. A mom shouldn't be able to put rules on toilet-time like that. Toilet-time is the last bastion of American freedom.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Is your mom always like that dude?	[]
Clyde	13	0	Look, could you guys just not say anything about this in school, please?	[]
Cartman	6	0	Of course, man. It's cool.	[]
Cartman	27	1	Clyde, Clyde! What have I told you about pissing on the seat? And Clyde's all like Ah, okay mom, fuck! Not in front of my friends!	['fuck']
Kyle	6	1	Cartman, it was actually really lame.	['lame']
Cartman	17	1	I know, right. Women are just jealous 'cause they have to sit outwards to pee and crap.	['crap']
Butters	51	1	Wait a minute! You're supposed to poop on the toilet facing out?  But I thought you sit on the toilet this way.  So that you have that nice little shelf for your comics and chocolate milk? Well, because you got the flusher right here. No?  Oh jeez, that's embarrassing.	['poop']
Betsy	5	0	Clyde! Clyde!  There you are!	[]
Clyde	1	0	Mom?	[]
Betsy	7	0	Clyde Donovan, you come home this instant!	[]
Clyde	1	0	Why?	[]
Betsy	17	0	What have I told you about putting the toilet seat down after you go to the bathroom?	[]
Clyde	5	0	Mom, I'm in class.	[]
Betsy	25	0	How many times do I have to tell you Clyde? I was trying to get ready for work and the toilet seat was up, again.	[]
Roger	12	0	Betsy, come back home. It's just not that big a deal.	[]
Betsy	30	1	No, Roger! It's a disgusting habit and I'm sick and tired of it. If I had sat down, I would have gotten toilet water all over my vagina.	['vagina']
Butters	5	0	My grandma is from Virginia.	[]
Betsy	19	0	You're coming home right now, and you're putting the seat down where it belongs. Let's go.	[]
Cartman	40	1	Dude, I'm telling you it was fucking hysterical. Clyde had to get up in the middle of class and follow his mom home to put the seat down. He was so embarrassed, dude, I thought he was gonna die.	['fucking']
Kyle	6	0	I know, fatass. I was there.	[]
Cartman	19	2	His mom... His mom goes: Clyde you're an asshole and now I have toilet water in my vagayjay.	['asshole', 'vagayjay']
Kyle	17	0	That's not what she said. You're putting extras on again. It's not that funny.	[]
Cartman	12	0	I know dude. The bathroom is the last bastion of American freedom.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Don't you just feel a little bad for Clyde?	[]
Cartman	2	0	Nuh-uh.	[]
Kyle	22	0	Well you should. The poor guy shouldn't be screamed for something that just isn't that big a deal at all.	[]
Kyle	4	0	What's going on?	[]
Stan	8	0	They are trying to save Clyde's mom.	[]
Kyle	2	0	From what?	[]
Cartman	10	0	They're saying Clyde left the toilet seat up again.	[]
Fireman 1	14	0	Hang it there. You're going to be fine okay? Stay with me now.	[]
Fireman 2	9	0	I'm sorry, there's nothing we can do.	[]
Roger	1	0	What?!	[]
Fireman 2	22	0	When she fell into the toilet, she also made it flush. It created a suction that's literally pulling out her insides.	[]
Roger	9	0	Can't we disconnect the toilet from the plumbing?	[]
Paramedic	19	0	Yes, we'll have to, but when we do that the change in pressure will rip out her organs.	[]
Clyde	8	0	But she's not gonna die, is she?	[]
Fireman 2	9	0	Why did you leave the toilet seat up, son?	[]
Betsy	33	0	Clyde! Clyde!  Clyde, I want you to know I don't blame you for this. We should have been h-h-harder on you all those times you left the toilet seat up.	[]
Clyde	4	0	Mom, I'm sorry.	[]
Betsy	42	0	Shhh! Sh! I.. don't... have a lot of time, Clyde. Just please put the toilet seat down from now on for your sister's sake, please. Oh, God, please let me go. Let me go. Do it! Do it! Do it!	[]
Clyde	1	0	Mom?	[]
Stephen	57	0	I'll always remember Betsy Donovan's kind nature, more than anything. She always treated people with dignity and respect.  What a tragedy she had to leave us so soon. But I'm sure Betsy is hoping that her death will help women everywhere, just take that extra second to look before they sit on a toilet.	[]
Linda	40	0	I'd like to say on behalf of the departed, that it isn't a woman's responsibility to see that the seat is down. It's a man's responsibility to put it down. It's not that hard.	[]
Women	5	0	Yeah, yes. That's right.	[]
Man With Grey Hair	35	1	Putting the toilet seat down isn't that hard. So is it too much to ask women to just look and put it down before they go plopping their butts blindly to the toilet bowl?	['butts']
Woman With Brown Hair	64	1	My God, people. This is a funeral! Please have some respect! There's a little boy here who has lost his mother!  He'll never see her again, because he couldn't take that sixth-tenths of a second to put the seat down when he was done peeing.  And now little Clyde's mother is dead, and the blood is on his penis.	['penis']
Terrance	15	1	Crap. It's too bad we didn't find any treasure on the subway, Phillip.	['crap']
Phillip	4	0	Oh, hello, Ugly Bob.	[]
Ugly Bob	4	0	Hello Terrance. Hello Phillip.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Mom, get the door!	[]
Terrance	8	0	You're looking hideously ugly today, Ugly Bob.	[]
Ugly Bob	8	0	How come you guys say stuff like that?	[]
Phillip	5	1	Because you're goddamn ugly...	['goddamn']
TSA Agent 1	9	0	Hello ma'am, we're the Toilet Safety Administration.	[]
Liane	2	0	The what?	[]
TSA Agent 2	19	0	After the recent tragedy, new safety regulations require us to check every toilet for security. Can we come in?	[]
Liane	2	0	Oh sure.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Who are these buttholes?	[]
Liane	15	0	It's the Toilet Safety Administration, hun. They're gonna do something to the potty.	[]
Cartman	10	0	My potty? What are they going to do to it?	[]
Cartman	6	0	Hey, hey! That's my bathroom!	[]
TSA Agent 1	12	0	Oh yeah, we're gonna have to completely redo this ma'am.	[]
Liane	1	0	Oh.	[]
TSA Agent 1	23	0	You need to have this counter moved to a minimum of six inches, but we'll go ahead and install your safety belt.	[]
Liane	2	0	Safety belt?	[]
TSA Agent 2	18	0	Federal law requires all toilets to be fitted with a safety harness so that nobody can fall in.	[]
Cartman	13	0	Dude, you can't make me wear a seatbelt to take a dump.	[]
TSA Agent 2	10	0	This is for your safety. A woman died, you know.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Yeah but the blood's on Clyde's wiener, not mine.	[]
Kyle	22	0	Sir, we are really worried about our friend Clyde. Everywhere he goes people are telling him he had blood on his wiener.	[]
Attorney	4	0	Uh-uh, go on.	[]
Stan	26	0	We keep trying to tell him maybe this all isn't his fault. Maybe the people who made the toilet are to blame for what happened.	[]
Kyle	10	0	So we were just wondering if we could sue somebody.	[]
Attorney	5	0	You can always sue somebody.	[]
Kyle	15	0	All right, you see, Clyde. Okay, we wanna help him sue whoever invented the toilet.	[]
Attorney	19	0	You got it.  Here we go, the inventor of the toilet.  Sir Thomas Harrington. In England, died in 1692.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Aw, he's dead?	[]
Stan	7	0	So then we can't sue him?	[]
Attorney	23	0	Why not? You can always sue somebody. It's just gonna take some special protocol. We would have to perform a sue-ance.	[]
Jimmy	6	0	A...a...a...a sue-ance?	[]
Attorney	23	0	You bet. Here at Hoffman and Turk we specialize in suing the dead. If you hire us, we'll work hard, for you.	[]
Stan	2	0	Wow, really?!	[]
Kyle	4	0	You hear that Clyde?	[]
Attorney	33	0	Now look. I'll be asking all of you to have a very open mind and a willingness to face you fears.  I warn you boys. A sue-ance can be very... expensive.	[]
Stan	2	0	How expensive?	[]
Attorney	5	0	How much do you have?	[]
Kyle	9	0	Clyde got $3000 from his mom's life insurance	[]
Attorney	10	0	Wow! That's exactly how much a sue-ance costs.	[]
Jimmy	4	0	Wow, that's weird.	[]
Randy	6	1	Aw, damn it.  He, hey officer.	['damn']
Officer	15	0	If you're stting on the toilet you need to wear your safety belt, sir.	[]
Randy	24	0	Yeah, I know, I had it on. I just took it off for a second to get the uh... to get to the uh...	[]
Officer	9	0	The address here is 260 Avenue de los Mexicanos?	[]
Randy	9	0	Oh, come on, don't give me a ticket!	[]
Officer	10	0	Gotta wear your safety belt or you could fall in.	[]
Randy	11	0	I'm not gonna fall in. I'm not a chick.	[]
Officer	24	0	The law is the law sir.  You can pay this by mail or appear in court on that date. Have a good day, sir.	[]
Randy	3	1	Yeah thanks.  Asshole.	['asshole']
Officer	3	0	You say something?	[]
Randy	17	2	No, I was talking to my asshole. C-C'mon, asshole. Let's get back to work.	['asshole', 'asshole']
Cartman	21	1	This is unbelievable. Stupid Toilet Safety Administration. You can't even take a crap at IHOP without a forty minute line!	['crap']
R. Booth	11	0	Shoes off, belts off! Sharp objects go in the plastic tray!	[]
Man 1	3	0	This is inhumane.	[]
R. Booth	3	0	Shut up! Sir.	[]
R. Wiley	6	0	Taking a dump today, ma'am?	[]
Woman 2	5	0	No, just need to pee.	[]
R. Wiley	9	1	I'll just need to check inside your aaasshole.	['aaasshole']
Cartman	26	1	Hey, how about you people speed it up in here? I'm about to crap my pants and I demand access to the toilet right now!	['crap']
R. Wiley	11	1	All right, do you mind if I touch your balls, sir?	['balls']
Cartman	14	2	What? Yes I'd mind! Do you mind if I touch your fucking balls?	['fucking', 'balls']
Gerald	4	0	Okay, I'm done.	[]
R. Wiley	10	1	Alright, sir. I just need to check inside your aaasshole.	['aaasshole']
Gerald	15	1	I don't need you wiping my ass for me. I'm a grown man.	['ass']
R. Wiley	10	0	Yes, you're a big boy, aren't you, sir?	[]
Gerald	6	0	Yeah, I'm a big boy.	[]
R. Wiley	6	0	That's a big boy, sir.	[]
Gerald	11	1	I'm a big boy. I took a big boy poop.	['poop']
R. Wiley	1	0	Yes.	[]
Attorney	28	0	Alright boys, sit down and clear your minds. The sue-ance is about to begin. Doors and windows are locked. You boys have your $500 in cash ready?	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Attorney	48	0	Alright. Then I've got this big bowl set here to catch all money we're about to make. Now. Let us start.  We call out to the land of the dead. Sir John Harrington. Your presence is requested. Appear to us, John Harrington. We have a subpoena.	[]
Jimmy	5	0	Jeez, it's not working.	[]
Attorney	14	0	John Harrington. My client is due compensation for negligence.  What is your name, spirit?	[]
Spirit	12	0	Burns. Jimmy Burns. What's it to you? Who are you, mugs?	[]
Attorney	21	0	That's how people talked in the past.  We have a claim against a John Harrington. Do you know him, spirit?	[]
Burns	18	0	Well, maybe I do and maybe I don't. Might need a little something to jar my memory.	[]
Attorney	10	0	We gotta grease him. Put a hundred in the box.	[]
Burns	11	0	Oh yeah, Harrington. I know him. Always going round inventing things.	[]
Attorney	9	0	Yes, that's him. Is his personage amongst you?	[]
Burns	9	0	Well, maybe it is and maybe it isn't.	[]
Attorney	4	0	Give him another hundred.	[]
Burns	20	0	Yeah, I've seen him around, alright. He was just down that way, bragging about some porcelain machine and whatever.	[]
Spirit 2	2	0	Nooo! Nooooo!	[]
Attorney	16	0	By the power of Christ, we sue you!  By the power of Christ, we sue you!	[]
Spirit 2	5	0	You can't sue me!	[]
Attorney	35	0	Quick, put the other $300 in the box!  This actually went really, really well. Always happens some bureaucrat tries to block the first sue-ance attempt, but this was good. We'll get him tomorrow.	[]
Clyde	4	0	So that's it?	[]
Attorney	30	0	Yeah, we're gonna need about 400 more dollars tomorrow. I know you're sad about your mom, Clyde, but don't worry. We're going to win this thing.	[]
R. Wiley	9	0	Put your coffee in the plastic tray please, sir.	[]
R. Booth	4	0	Shoes off. Belts off.	[]
Randy	2	0	Yeah yeah.	[]
R. West	6	0	Got any metal in your pockets?	[]
R. Wiley	7	1	I just need to check your asshole.	['asshole']
Randy	2	0	So ridiculous.	[]
R. Wiley	2	1	Asshole clear.	['asshole']
Randy	1	0	Thanks.	[]
R. West	5	0	Pick your coffee up, sir.	[]
R. Wiley	12	0	Anyways, he says I'm getting nothing anyway, so then you can...	[]
Randy	5	0	Hey, what's that thing?	[]
R. Wiley	9	0	That's a camera. It's a security camera.	[]
Randy	8	0	Aw, you people have me on camera now?	[]
R. West	16	0	It's okay, sir. There's just one person viewing the monitors in a discrete location.	[]
Cartman	36	0	Exactly how long are we going to sit around as our freedoms are stripped away one by one. It's time for us to stand together, and say, we want the government out of our bathrooms.	[]
People	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Cartman	34	0	Now listen. All we have to do is agree as a community to all bolt our toilet seats down. If they can't raise or lower, there's zero chance of anyone falling in.	[]
Mr. Garrison	16	0	Hey, yeah. If there's no toilet seats, the government can't make toilet seat laws.	[]
Jimbo	5	0	Alright, let's do it.	[]
Sheila	19	0	No, no, hold on. If the seat can't raise up the men will just pee all over it.	[]
Man 3	4	0	No, we won't.	[]
Woman 3	3	0	Yeah, you will.	[]
Cartman	32	0	Well, sorry if women might have to deal with a little splash of pee on the rim, but it's a far better solution than having the government in out bathrooms, right?	[]
Woman 4	18	0	How about we agree to that, if men will agree that they will always sit down to urinate.	[]
Stephen	18	0	Well, no, you can't make men sit down to pee. How could we play sink the boat?	[]
Randy	12	0	Yeah, how will Nelson and I make an X on sleepover nights?	[]
Man 4	30	2	What about us loggers? Hardworking man who like to stand up after they have taken a poo and then turn around and but the poo in half with their urine?	['poo', 'poo']
Cartman	28	0	Well, sorry, but if we don't want the government treating us like children, we might have to give up being able to pee out feces in half.	[]
Man 4	19	0	But folks been logging round these parts for generations. My pappy taught me logging. And his pappy before him.	[]
Randy	11	0	Yeah, I think we've just gotta live with the TSA.	[]
Attorney	23	0	Oh, oohh! The spirits of the dead are looking over the subpoena. Motion for summary judgement on behalf of the plaintiff? Ah, aaaah!	[]
Jimmy	4	0	What's happening now?	[]
Attorney	29	0	Our motion has been denied by the judge.  Concentrate boys!  This specter is like none I have ever encountered. I managed to avert liability within injunction against out claim.	[]
Stan	5	0	So what does that mean?	[]
Attorney	28	0	We'll hit him with a class action lawsuit tomorrow. We'll need all your friends and family to sign a petition and kick in 50 bucks each.	[]
Kyle	1	0	What?	[]
Attorney	14	0	Hang in there, Clyde. This is all to make the world a safer place.	[]
Monitor Man	2	0	Security breeeach!	[]
Reporter	42	0	An embarrassing day for the toilet safety administration. Shocking outrage ensued after an unknown terrorist managed to get through TSA security with a gun and a baby. Leaving the toilet seat up. The head TSA chief of operations had this to say:	[]
R. West	1	0	Shiiiit!	[]
Reporter	15	0	Meanwhile, outraged civilians are claiming they're finally fed up with the overblown government bureaucracy.	[]
Randy	36	0	What good is the TSA if they aren't protecting us? Why have we given up freedom if a terrorist can take a hostage in a bathroom with a baby and a gun on the toilet?	[]
Woman 5	6	0	And the toilet seat was up.	[]
Randy	13	0	We've all stood by as our mother government has taken out dignity.	[]
Cartman	3	0	That's right.	[]
Randy	11	0	Now it's time for us to take responsibility for ourselves.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Randy	9	0	It is time for us all to grow up.	[]
Cartman	3	0	That's right.	[]
Randy	7	0	It is time for a sue-ance.	[]
People	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Cartman	9	1	Wait, what? What the fuck is a sue-ance?	['fuck']
Reporter 2	39	0	Tom, I'm standing outside the South Park courthouse where experts have successfully summoned the ghost of toilet inventor Sir John Harrington. Now that the spirit has crossed over from the dead, lawyers are gonna try and sue him.	[]
Attorney	11	0	Sir Thomas Harrington, your extreme negligence has cost tax payers millions.	[]
Spirit	2	0	No! No!	[]
Attorney	15	0	You will be sued, spirit. Thy liability is without question.  Appear before this court, Harrington.	[]
Spirit	1	0	Never!	[]
Attorney	7	0	Quick, everyone, get our all your money.	[]
Betsy	2	0	Clyde? Clyde?	[]
Clyde	1	0	Mom?	[]
Betsy	16	0	This lawyer is a fraud. He has been swindling you and your friends for your money.	[]
Attorney	6	1	Fuck me, it's a ghost.	['fuck']
Betsy	23	0	You can't sue the dead, Clyde. Putting the toilet seat down is a matter of simple etiquette. It's common sense, Clyde!	[]
Cartman	5	0	Oh boy, here we go.	[]
Betsy	29	0	Don't try and blame mommy's death on anything but your failure to something I have asked you time and time again to do.  It's your fault!	[]
Spirit 2	25	0	Now hold on a second! It's not anyone's fault.  I am sick an tired of all this nonsense over my porcelain toilet machine.	[]
P. Sanchez	6	0	There he is, Sir John Harrington.	[]
Mr. Garrison	3	0	Quick, sue him!	[]
Sir Harrington	49	0	You can't sue me.  You're all using my toilet invention the wrong way.  When you have to sit and take a Sir Harrington you're supposed to be facing this way.  So you can use the little shelf for your books, and your quill and your ink.	[]
Butters	15	0	A-ha! I told you you should sit on it that way! I told you!	[]
Sir Harrington	34	0	Why would I design it so that when you're finished taking a Sir Harrington, you have to stand up, turn around and look right down at your Harrington to flush. That's gross.	[]
Randy	20	0	Yeah, but... but if you sit on it that way, you have to take your pants all the way off.	[]
Sir Harrington	14	0	Of course! Why do you think I designed toilet rooms with a laundry hole?	[]
Randy	9	0	That's what that hole is for? Oh.  Oops.	[]
Cartman	40	1	So then... so then Clyde's mom's ghost was all like Clyde, what have I told you Clyde, you asshole! And Clyde is all like Mom, leave me alone! I'm seriously. Stop, please! Dude, it was a riot.	['asshole']
Clyde	6	0	That's not what I said.	[]
Cartman	61	1	Hah. Yeah, well, I'm just glad that stupid TSA crap is over with. I know you've had a tough week, Clyde. But at least your mom didn't die for nothing. I mean, we're kinda right back at the bathroom being the last bastion of American freedom. So technically, your mom did die for nothing, but... Clyde? Clyde?	['crap']
Cartman	4	0	Clyde, you there? Hello?	[]
