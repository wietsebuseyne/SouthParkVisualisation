Cartman	12	0	Would you look at that? It's just incredible, isn't it?	[]
Stan	16	0	I still can't believe it, even though it's right there in front of me.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Yeah, it's just so astounding.	[]

Kyle	13	0	This is serious. They've been going out for almost two weeks now.	[]
Jimmy	6	0	Well, so, w-who is she?	[]
Cartman	30	0	Her name's Tammy Warner. She's the only girl in school whose family is actually poorer than Kenny's. It's really kind of beautiful if you ask me.	[]
Butters	12	0	Hey, you guys! You guys, I think we have a big problem!	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Butters	6	0	Well, apparently Kenny has a girlfriend!	[]
Stan	9	0	Yeah, dude, Tammy Warner. She's a fifth grader.	[]
Butters	5	0	Um, does Kenny like her?	[]
Kyle	11	0	I guess so. She's, like, his first real girlfriend ever.	[]
Butters	4	0	Oh, no. Oh, geez!	[]
Cartman	5	0	Butters, what's the problem?	[]
Butters	40	1	Well, I just talked to Brad Dixon. Tammy Warner is bad news. All the fifth graders call her a slut, on account of she gave this kid Dave Darsky a B.J. in the parking lot of TGI Friday's.	['slut']
Kyle	1	0	What?!	[]
Butters	14	1	It's true! Ask anybody in fifth grade. Tammy Warner is a total slut!	['slut']

Kenny	2	0	(But what?)	[]
Kyle	8	0	W-well, we've heard that she's...	[]
Cartman	26	1	Kenny.  Your girlfriend is a notorious whore. She even gave a kid named Dave Darsky a B.J. in the parking lot of TGI Friday's.	['whore']
Kenny	1	0	(Huh?)	[]
Cartman	6	1	Your girlfriend's a slut, dude.	['slut']

Kenny	12	0	(Yeah, I was kinda thinking we could go to TGI Friday's.)	[]
Tammy	3	0	TGI Friday's?	[]
Kenny	5	0	(Yep. I like the food!)	[]
Tammy	71	0	Yeah, okay. But...  Kenny. Listen. Uh, there's somethin' I need to talk to you about. There's a lot of rumors goin' around about me, that I agreed to give a boy a B.J.? Well, it's true.  But it was before you and I were together, and it wasn't my fault!  See, I was watchin' the Disney Channel, and that show came on with the Jonas Brothers.	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Jonas Brothers?)	[]
Tammy	62	0	You know that teenage boy band? Every time I see them I get so tingly. I just completely lose control.  And then Dave Darsky showed up and took me to TGI Friday's,  and it just happened. But it was only for one second, and I had my eyes closed. I know it's terrible. Can you... can you forgive me, Ken?	[]
Clerk	12	0	There you are, young man. Two tickets to the Jonas Brothers concert.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Thanks.)	[]
Cartman	12	1	The Jonas Brothers? Dude, Kenny, what the hell is wrong with you?	['hell']
Kyle	9	1	Aren't those the queermos on the Disney Channel?	['queermos']
Kenny	19	0	(Yeah. Tammy said if I got her the tickets for the concert, she would give me a B.J.!)	[]
Stan	3	0	A B.J.?	[]
Kyle	9	0	You want Tammy to give you a B.J.?	[]
Kenny	3	0	(Of course, dude!)	[]
Cartman	26	0	Kenny! You're gonna let a girl put her mouth on your wiener? Do you know how disgusting that is? Girls' mouths are full of germs!	[]
Stan	5	0	Yeah, dude, that's gross.	[]
Kenny	10	0	(I don't care. I've gotta get some protection.)	[]
Kyle	4	0	What kind of protection?	[]
Kenny	8	1	(I'd like a box of condoms, please.)	['condoms']
Clerk 2	11	1	Box of condoms. Certainly, little boy. What kind would you like?	['condoms']
Kenny	7	0	(Uhm, I'll take one of those.)	[]
Clerk 2	4	0	These here? Why, certainly.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Cool!)	[]
Kyle	9	0	Kenny, aren't you a little young for this?	[]
Kenny	11	0	(No, I'm not young and I want a B.J.)	[]
Cartman	38	2	Just because you have condoms doesn't mean you're safe, Kenny! Statistically speaking, the most bacteria-ridden place on the planet is the mouth of an American woman! And you're gonna let that near your penis?	['condoms', 'penis']
Kenny	3	0	(Yep! Woo-hoo!)	[]
Tammy	16	0	Go, baby! Whoooo! Kenny, you're the best for bringing me here. Isn't this awesome?	[]

Jonas Brothers	39	0	I can't wait till the day I kiss you. Until then I have to tease you. 'Cause my mom doesn't like it when I'm naughty. She'll make me clean my room if I'm naughty.	[]

Usher	6	0	All right, right this way, girls.	[]
Roadie	14	0	Yeah, come on in everyone. The band is waiting for you.  Uh, not you.	[]

Nick	11	0	And see if you'll wear purity rings from now on.	[]
Tammy	2	0	Purity rings?	[]
Joe	21	1	We all wear purity rings. It means we are going to be pure and not have sex until we're married.	['sex']
Kevin	19	0	And it means we stay away from bad stuff and avoid people who swear and watch naughty TV shows.	[]
Nick	6	0	That's just how we roll.	[]

Kyle	33	1	Alright alright Kenny, calm down. You're too young to be getting BJs anyway. It's good you and Tammy are making a commitment to each other that isn't based on sex.	['sex']
Kenny	25	2	(Yeah.)  (It isn't fair I was so close to getting a blow job and I'll never get one now - this is fucking bullshit...)	['fucking', 'bullshit']

Stan	16	1	They're rings that says they're not gonna have sex or do anything naughty anymore.	['sex']
Butters	20	1	Huh... a ring that says you'll be together but not have sex... Isn't that called a wedding ring?	['sex']
Jonas Brothers	148	2	I've got a ring on my finger to remind me what I cannot do. Can't just do whatever I feel like, I've got to stay right, just and true. I can't hang out with my buddies and get into trouble,  'Cause now we're both wearing these rings for each other. But who needs sex and drugs and partying  When we can cook a meal, then sit around and watch Netflix... Bay-bay! I've got a ring on my finger to remind me that I must behave. No need to chase after girls; it's a promise I can never break. I made a commitment and it is forever,  So we can spend every waking minute together. And if we get bored it won't be a problem,  'Cause we can just hang out with other couples who wear these rings... Bay-bay!	['sex', 'drugs']
Purity Boy 1	30	0	Yeah, we found out that once you wear purity rings, it's best to hang out with other couples that do. Got more in common. Isn't that right, Sarah?	[]

Kevin	5	0	Yeah, you tell 'em, Joe.	[]
Disney Exec 1	17	0	Boys, I know you're tired, but the purity rings are important to the company's image.	[]
Joe	7	0	We don't care about the company.	[]
Director	11	0	And you're gonna say that to the boss's face?	[]
Kevin	8	0	We aren', we aren't afraid of him.	[]

Director	7	0	Uh we'll just leave you alone.	[]
Mickey	9	0	So uh, I guess we have some issues, haha?	[]
Kevin	6	0	We... need to talk about something.	[]
Mickey	17	0	Oh boy! I just love flying all the way to Colorado to hear about your problems, haha.	[]
Joe	16	0	Look, we just want our concerts to be about our music, and not about purity rings.	[]
Mickey	58	1	Oh Gosh, fellas, let me explain this to you one more time. You have to wear the purity rings because that's how we can sell sex to little girls, haha. See, if we make the posters with little girls reaching for your junk, then you have to wear purity rings or else Disney Company looks baaad, haha.	['sex']
Joe	12	1	Well we don't wanna be selling sex to little girls anymore.	['sex']
Mickey	4	0	The rings stay on!	[]
Joe	10	0	Well, well, maybe we'll just refuse to go onstage.	[]
Mickey	32	4	You don't... Fucking..Talk to me. Like that, haha. You little... piece of... shit, Haha!  Get the fuck up. Get the fuck up! Haha.  Now, do we have a problem?! Haha.	['fucking', 'shit', 'fuck', 'fuck']

Stan	8	0	You want your Grey's Anatomy back, Kenny?	[]
Kenny	19	1	(Oh, Grey's Anatomy. Cool! Oh man, this is a great DVD. We're gonna have the ... sex, yeah.)	['sex']
Stan	14	0	You guys, I think this is serious. There's something really wrong with him.	[]
Kyle	16	1	It's that ring. Somehow, putting on that ring has turned Kenny into a boring turd.	['turd']
Cartman	7	1	Oh my God, look at this!  Motherfucker!	['motherfucker']
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Cartman	20	1	Jonas Brothers talk music, faith in God, and purity rings. These Disney douche bags are the ones causing all this!	['douche']
Kyle	12	0	Yeah, this all happened the day after he went to that concert!	[]
Stan	15	0	All right, come on guys, we're not sitting back and watching our friend die!	[]
Kyle	11	0	Hold tight, buddy. We're gonna find a cure for you.	[]

Mickey	19	0	Yeah, that's good. Get a close-up on their purity rings. Close-up on the purity rings, haha.	[]
Host	42	1	That's wonderful, boys.  It's good that little girls can see a concert and not have it be about sex. We understand that at the concert tonight you'll be dousing girls in the audience with white foam. Is that correct?	['sex']
Nick	2	0	Uh huh.	[]
Joe	3	0	Yeah. Uh huh.	[]
Kevin	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Nick	1	0	Yeah.	[]

Stan	4	0	Excuse us. Excuse us.	[]
Girl 2	8	0	Hey, what do you think you're doing?!	[]

Cartman	7	1	Hey! Hey, those Jonas Brothers are assholes!	['assholes']
Stan	10	1	Yeah, their purity rings turned our friend into a douche!	['douche']
Joe	1	0	Huh?	[]
Kyle	14	2	What the hell do you think you're doing spreading this crap to kids?!	['hell', 'crap']
Mickey	19	2	Who the hell are these guys?  Are they from DreamWorks? Goddamn Eisner trying to hurt this company again, haha?	['hell', 'goddamn']
Cartman	30	1	This whole thing is a freaking sham! I see what you're doin' now! You're tryin' to sell sex to young girls and then confuse them by  teh- ...tehhhh	['sex']
Kyle	1	0	Cartman?	[]
Mickey	10	0	You aren't ruining my plans this time, DreamWorks, haha!	[]
Stan	7	1	Dude, who the hell did that?  Hwa?	['hell']
Kyle	1	0	Dow...	[]

Mickey	29	1	They almost ruined everything, haha. How did something like this happen, haha?  Wake up. Wake up, you little prick! Haha.  Who do you work for? DreamWorks?  Answer me, haha!	['prick']
Stan	7	0	We... don't work for any-body.	[]
Mickey	23	0	Oh boy, I sure believe that, haha.  You just tried to ruin Disney Company's big night for your own amusement, huh?! Haha.	[]
Cartman	7	1	The hell did you do to us?!	['hell']
Mickey	3	0	SHUT UP!  Haha.	[]
Announcer	19	0	And now, Disney Channel presents... the Jonas Brothers 3-D concert spectacular!  Live from Red Rocks Amphitheater in Colorado!	[]
Male Host	17	0	Truly a night of magic as we're set for the biggest concert event of the year!	[]

Kenny	5	1	(And not getting a blowjob...)	['blowjob']
Male Host	16	0	We understand the Jonas Brothers are getting ready. What's going on backstage must be exciting.	[]
Mickey	14	0	You'd better start talkin', haha!  You'd better start talkin' right now, haha!	[]
Stan	21	0	We told you: we aren't working for another studio and there isn't a plan to sabotage your big night.	[]
Kyle	14	0	We came on our own 'cause our friend's purity ring is killing him.	[]
Mickey	9	0	You're lying! I'll cut you up, haha!	[]
Joe	20	0	You see? We were right about the purity rings! A nice Christian symbol can't be used for profit gains.	[]
Kevin	5	0	We've all angered God.	[]
Mickey	174	7	You think God is in control here, haha?! I am in control! I've been in control since the '50s in case you haven't noticed, haha!  You three faggots are going onstage, and  YOU three faggots aren't going to stop me! NOBODY IS RUINING THIS EVENT!! Haha. I've worked too long and too hard to have anybody  fuck this up!  Where would you be without me, Jonas Brothers? Haha. Your music sucks and you know it! Haha. It's because you make little girls' 'ginies tickle! And when little girls' 'ginies tickle, I make money! Haha. And that's because little girls are fucking stupid! Haha. And the purity rings make it okay to do whatever I want! Haha. Even the Christians are too fucking stupid to figure out I'm selling sex to their daughters! I've made billions off of Christian ignorance for decades now, haha! And do you know why?!  Because Christians are retard-ed! Haha.  They believe in a talking dead guy! Haha.  Ohhh. Haha. Hello, folks.	['faggots', 'faggots', 'fuck', 'fucking', 'fucking', 'sex', 'retard']
Audience	1	0	BOOO!!	[]
Mickey	11	0	Now now, take it easy, haha. Here's the Jonas Brothers.	[]

Roadie	9	0	It's over, Mr. Mouse. Everyone's tuning out.	[]
Mickey	9	1	NO! NO GODDAMNIT! NO! SHUT UP! SHUT! UP! AAAAAAGH!	['goddamnit']
Father	11	0	That's it girls. No more Disney TV for a while.	[]
Reporter	26	0	Tom, the Disney Jonas Brothers 3D Television Special has failed, costing the Disney Company millions, and once again Mickey is pissed off and throwing a fit.	[]
Mickey	13	0	Vengeance is mine! You are all ants and I am your destroyer, haha.	[]
Reporter	22	0	The Disney purity ring venture will now most likely prove a marketing bust, as Mickey returns to Valhalla to slumber and feed.	[]
Tammy	16	0	Aw Ken, look what we've become. We're way too young to be this boring.	[]
Kenny	13	0	(I agree. Let's put in this DVD and watch Grey's Anatomy.)	[]
Tammy	18	0	No! I don't want to watch Grey's Anatomy, Ken. Let's take off these rings, Ken.	[]
Kenny	11	0	(Take off the ring? You can take off the ring??)  (Really?)	[]
Tammy	37	2	Let's take them off and just be kids again. There'll be plenty of time to wear rings and be boring and lame when we reach our late 30s and we're boring and lame anyway.	['lame', 'lame']
Kenny	4	1	(Yeah. Screw this crap!)	['crap']
Tammy	5	0	Oh I feel better already!	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Me too!)	[]
Tammy	11	0	What say you and me... go to T.G.I. Fridays?	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Woo-hoo!!)	[]
Father Maxi	53	1	And so, as we commit this young child to the earth, let us all be reminded that syphilis is still a deadly disease, and it can be caught even if using protection. This young boy learned the hard way that there's no guarantee... For the world of oral sex is a world...	['sex']
Cartman	31	1	I told him... A woman's mouth is the most germ-ridden place on earth, I said. Statistically the most unsafe place for a man to put his penis, I said.	['penis']
Kyle	4	0	Well, now we know.	[]
Cartman	6	0	And knowing is half the battle.	[]
