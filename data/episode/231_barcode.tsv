Dan	12	0	Artonius Jackson catches the ball , he's running down the sideline-  Ohhhh!	[]
Randy	7	0	BOHHHHH! Did you see that hit? BOOOOM!	[]
Dan	12	0	Jackson stops at the 45 and he is slow to get up.	[]
Randy	11	0	That was a great hit boys. Remember that at practice tomorrow.	[]
Commentator	30	0	Yeah, Jackson took a real shot and...  well I'm not sure what he's doing now, but uh, it appears as if he's looking for his keys, Dan.	[]
Dan	24	0	Yeah, and that doesn't make a lot of sense, because ever since his concussion in '06, he doesn't even have a license.	[]
Commentator	22	0	Coach Martin is coming over to tell him that now, but Jackson appears to think he's in a car driving home.	[]
Dan	38	0	Well, during this time out we're happy to be joined by the commissioner of the NFL, Roger Goodell. Commissioner, a lot of hoopla about concussions this year in the NFL. How's the league handling all that?	[]
Goodell	31	0	Well, there certainly are interesting statistics coming out, Dan, and we are deeply concerned, anduh and waiting to see if there's... really any direct correlation between football and head trauma.	[]
Dan	35	0	Oh, and it looks like some of the MFL alumni are takin' the field now. There's All-Pro safety Martin Gregors , and fullback Jim Harris. Looks like his pants are down around his ankles.	[]
Commentator	20	0	Somebody should let him know. Oh, and Old Surehand Mike Tafthill , who seems to be baking an imaginary cake, Dan.	[]
Dan	27	0	Yeah, not sure if that's meant to be a cake or, or perhaps a, a loaf of bread, but he definitely thinks he's baking something.	[]
Butters	15	0	Boy, I just don't get football. Guess that's why I suck at it.	[]
Stan	12	0	You don't suck at football, Butters, you suck at all sports.	[]
Butters	21	0	That's true. Old Eric tells me I should work at a Thai massage parlor, I'm so good at sucking.	[]
Cartman	4	0	That's right, Butters.	[]
Dan	15	0	And with that the Browns are ready to kick it off back to the Broncos	[]
Randy	22	0	All right all right, here we go boys! Watch them on the kickoff, all right? Special teams are the most important plays.	[]
Kyle	6	0	We don't have kickoffs anymore.	[]
Randy	1	0	Huh?	[]
Stan	18	0	The school said they're the most dangerous plays, so they don't have us do 'em anymore.	[]
Randy	8	1	Wait wait wait, wait. Whoa! What! The! FUCK?!	['fuck']
Principal Victoria	15	0	Okay, before we get started with this PTA meeting, does anyone have any outstanding issues?	[]
Randy	18	0	Yeah, I'd like to talk about this genius new rule in the football program about no kickoffs?	[]
Mr. Mackey	18	0	Uh, yes, we've decided to go without kickoffs because of the concerns raised over concussions, m'kay?	[]
Randy	34	0	Oh yeah, we don't want our kids getting hurt playing football! But I think I have a way to make it even better! Why don't we have the players just wear bras?!	[]
Mr. Adler	1	0	Bras?	[]
Randy	31	0	Yeah, the players should all wear bras! And instead of helmets, they should wear little tinfoil hats, 'cause, you know, it's the future and we shouldn't be so barbaric!	[]
Linda	10	0	How would the bras and tinfoil hats make it safer?	[]
Randy	36	0	Oh, you're all not getting it! See, while we're at it, we'll have a balloon instead of a ball, and whoever catches the balloon tries to run while all the other players hug!	[]
Mr. Mackey	9	0	Huh. You you think the students would like that?	[]
Randy	19	0	Oh they'd love it! A sport where safety is all that matters? How about we call it sarcastaball?!	[]
Mr. Mackey	14	0	Hnkay, would, would you mind being the coach of the South Park sarcastaball team?	[]
Randy	14	0	Jesus Christ! Yes, I would love to be the coach of the sarcastaball team!	[]
Stan	8	0	Dad, do we really have to wear bras?	[]
Randy	14	0	Yes Stan, this is what people want! Don't worry, you look really cool.	[]
Butters	13	0	I got the balloon, Coach Marsh. Er, what should I do with it?	[]
Randy	17	0	Oh, you know, try to get it into the end zone, but be really polite about it.	[]
Butters	18	0	Okay! Hey, hey, heh excuse me. Pardon me. Heh,  you guys look terrific. Wow, this game is great!	[]
Principal Victoria	5	0	How's it going, coach?	[]
Randy	28	0	How's it going? Awesome! Nobody's getting hurt and the kids are learning valuable life lessons! 'Cause hugging and safety are what the world is all about!	[]
Principal Victoria	7	0	So you're happy with these changes?	[]
Randy	11	0	Happy? I'm thrilled! Look at how much better this is!	[]
Principal Victoria	1	0	Okay.	[]
Anchor	26	0	Is football safe for your kids? Concerned Parent Randy Marsh says No, and has started a movement to reform the sport, gathering followers by the hundreds.	[]
Randy	53	0	Oh, this is good! Nice for you all to turn out in record numbers to show your support for sarcastaball!  Yeah yeah, we're, we're through with our kids getting knocked on the ground and tackled! Let's make sarcastaball the official school sport nationwide!  Go on, pat yourselves on the back!	[]
Anchor	20	0	Showing just how much one concerned parent can do, Marsh then found himself in front of the leaders of Washington.	[]
Randy	30	0	Yeah, yeah! Let's do that! We got the economy in the toilet, a big election coming up, but this country's number one priority should be making football safer!	[]
Kyle	17	0	This is ridiculous! Are we really going to go out there and play North Park like this?!	[]
Clyde	20	0	I can't even remember if we're supposed to hug the fullback or compliment him. I'm so confused.	[]
Stan	26	0	This game is stupid. I have no idea how to go out on the field and be as nice as I can to the other team!	[]
Cartman	6	0	Yeah, you know what?  Screw this!	[]
Butters	27	0	Hey, whoa! Well I can't believe what I'm hearing!  We've been practicing and gettin' ready for this game, and you fellas just wanna quit?!	[]
Kyle	10	0	We don't even understand how this game is played.	[]
Butters	57	0	This great game isn't about plays. It's about sportsmanship. And compassion. And when I look around this locker room, well I see some of the nicest, most compassionate guys I've ever met!  Well Token, you're nicer than anybody I know.  And Clyde! Well you give better hugs than anyone out on that field!	[]
Cartman	3	0	That's true.	[]
Butters	56	0	Are we just gonna let North Park walk away with a victory because we think they know how to be nicer than us?  Bein' nice is about what's inside you! When your enemy is nice to you, you just be nice right back! And if they give you two balloons, well you give them three!	[]
"Clyde, Kenny"	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Butters	38	0	And when they try an-and thank you for those balloons, you say Ah I don't need any thanks! I did it 'cause it was the right thing to do! And then you give them a smile!	[]
Boys	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Butters	72	0	And when that other team tries to cover you, well that's when you gotta reach deep down. Right down to your creamy center. Well that place, well that place inside of you where, where all the goouey happy-lovin' goo sits and you just gotta use that and be the nicest, most compassionate player you've ever been, and let the world know that we will not fall down so easy!	[]
Boys	2	0	Yeah! Yeah!	[]
Cartman	9	0	Let's do this.  Stan, hook up my bra.	[]
Goodell	55	0	As commissioner of the NFL, I am so thrilled to see our nation's youth embrace sarcastaball over traditional football. Oh, but why stop there? Since football is so barbaric, we should change too. So let's give a biiig welcome to the new coach of the Denver Broncos, Randy Marsh.  Congratulations, Marsh. Good job!	[]
Randy	14	0	Oh thank you, commissioner! I'm thrilled to be a part of this! Thanks!	[]
Goodell	2	0	Nice going!	[]

Kyle	3	0	We can't.	[]
Clyde	7	0	We don't have a coach, Kyle.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Who needs a coach? We have Butters.	[]
Butters	1	0	Huh?	[]

Butters	9	0	I was havin' happy dreams, about a girl and-!	[]
Stephen	16	0	All right Butters, let's... it's happy feelings, let's just not talk about it.	[]
Butters	7	0	Okay Dad!  Oh! Saaave that, for later.	[]
Announcer	14	0	The score is zero to zero as the Steelers kick off to the Broncos.	[]
Cheerleader 1	3	0	Go Broncos, Go.	[]
Dan	50	0	Manning has the ball. He's saying some really great things about the other team. Manning met by LaMarr Woodley. He's giving the balloon to Woodley. The referee comes in.  Oh, the referee is calling that a touchdown! Oh wait, now another official is signalling that's a safety!	[]
Randy	6	0	Oh yeah, nice going, replacement refs!	[]
Dan	13	0	They're gonna have to sort this one out with a side judge.	[]
Side Judge	8	2	Fuck it, it's a fucking field goal!	['fuck', 'fucking']
Randy	3	0	YEAH!  YEAH! WOO!	[]
Reporter 1	15	0	Coach, three to nothing victory over the Steelers. You must feel like a reeeal winner.	[]
Randy	15	0	Yeah, well, the other team was just so awesome on offense I was really scared.	[]
Reporter 1	20	0	Coach Belichick says,  No way we can beat the Broncos. They've had the same coach for almost a day.	[]
Randy	21	0	Oh yeah, I'm just the guy who invented sarcastaball! There's no way I'd know how to coach it!	[]
Reporter 2	7	0	Guess we'll find out on Sunday.	[]

Manning	10	0	Practice on Monday? That's just what I wanna do!	[]
Randy	3	0	That's IT!	[]
Cartman	6	0	Hey Butters, you got a minute?	[]
Butters	3	0	Wuh sure, Eric.	[]
Cartman	43	0	I don't now what to do. Kids are starting to make fun of me because, I'm no good at sarcastaball. I suck at being nice and polite. I'm so good at sucking I should work at a Thai massage parlor.	[]
Butters	14	0	Uh-uh oh, no E-eric, you're, why you're a great player.	[]
Cartman	11	0	No, I just don't have the mojo you have, Butters.	[]
Butters	34	0	Oh, well, ye-Eric, ah I told you: everyone has a creamy filling inside them, where all the feelings of compassion and joy come from. Oh, didn't your dad ever tell you that?	[]
Cartman	6	0	...I don't have a dad.	[]
Butters	94	0	...Oh right, I, I'm sorry. Well, everyone has a creamy filling, Eric. And and some people have so much of that filling that it, that it comes out sometimes. A lot of times, when I go to sleep, and especially if I've had them wonderful dreams that make me feel really good, sometimes I wake up, and when I wake up, I I realize some of my goo has come out.  But I always make sure I keep it, just in case I ever run out of all my sunshine happy feelings.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Youuu save it all?	[]
Butters	19	0	My goo doesn't come out every night, but I sure do seem to have a surplus of it.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Butters, do you think your goo might work on someone else?	[]
Butters	13	0	I don't know. Weh I never really thought of it that way.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Hm, it's kind of a grapey, bleachy flavor.	[]
Butters	6	0	Do you feel warm and compassionate?	[]
Cartman	6	1	Holy shit I think I do.	['shit']
Jim Rome	56	0	Welcome back to Rome. We're gonna talk some sarcastaball. I can't wait. I can't wait to talk sarcastaball because it's really compelling.  Joining me now is the coach of the Denver Broncos and the inventor of sarcastaball, Randy Marsh. Thanks for calling in, Randy. Really happy to have you on the show.	[]
Randy	9	0	Yeah, it's awesome to be on your show.	[]
Jim Rome	22	0	Randy, first off, thanks for taking the sports that we all love and turning it into a sarcastic nightmare. Way to go.	[]
Randy	28	0	Thanks, Jim. 'Cause it's totally what I intended. You know, when I came up with the idea I was sure it was gonna end up like this.	[]
Jim Rome	68	0	Well it certainly makes for an exciting game. How about last night's nail-biter that ended zero to zero? That's a game I wanna watch twice. That's a game I wanna watch four times. Check that: I'll watch that game... five times.  Good luck on Sunday. I'm sure that'll be another game that I could watch... twelve times. Check that: thirteen times.	[]
Randy	2	0	Thanks Jim.	[]
Sharon	11	0	Randy, aren't you gonna come join your family for dinner?	[]
Randy	34	0	Oh yeah, I've totally got time to do that, Sharon! In fact, how about I go downstairs and make a four-course meal for all of you? Check that: a seven-course meal?	[]
Sharon	12	0	Randy, something's happened. Are you un-able to stop being sarcastic?	[]
Randy	9	0	Oh, right! I can't stop being sarcastic now!	[]
Sharon	15	0	I'm telling you, Randy, I think this sport is doing something to your brain.	[]
Randy	16	0	Right, it's doing something to my brain! And now I can't stop being sarcastic!	[]
Sharon	4	0	Do you mean that?	[]
Randy	10	0	Yes! I totally mean it!  Help me, Sharon. Help me.	[]
Butters	27	0	All right, first string, cover those wideouts. Tell 'em how much you like their outfits! Clyde, Token! Hug those two players and give their quarterback a kiss.	[]
Spectators	1	0	Awwwwww!	[]
Stan	3	0	Cartman, you idiot!	[]
Butters	17	0	Stay positive, Stan! All right guys, cuddle up, cuddle up!  Now what is goin' on out there?	[]
Cartman	16	0	That kid is provoking us! He's saying mean things to try and piss us off.	[]
Clyde	8	0	Yeah. We need more of your mojo, Butters.	[]
Butters	9	0	Oh, all right. Well all right, here you go.	[]
Doctor	15	0	Uh hum. Mmm.  I'm sorry, Mr. Marsh, but there appears to be permanent damage.	[]
Randy	11	0	Oh boy, this is great! My week just keeps getting better.	[]
Sharon	6	0	How do we fix this, doctor?	[]
Doctor	18	0	You don't. I'm sorry, there... just isn't enough research in how sarcasm affects the brain.	[]
Randy	29	0	So that's it.  I should just go home and forget about what this sport has done to me. Let thousands of people play sarcastaball and get hurt too!	[]
Doctor	20	0	Ohh, rreally? You, you think there's a correlation between sarcasm and sarcastaball?  Really?  That's fascinating. Please, go on.	[]
Randy	24	0	No, sarcastaball has nothing to do with it. I just... I just really enjoy being sarcastic and so I must be finding an excuse.	[]
Doctor	40	0	You know, I have a 50-year-old Alzheimer's patient out in the waiting room who can't even remember his family, but... let's forget about him and focus on how sarcastaball might be damaging people's brains.	[]
Randy	21	0	My son is out there playing that game! It's heartwarming to see you have such high regard for his safety!	[]
Doctor	46	0	Okay, well I've got a better idea. Let's get all the funding for cancer research and genetic diseases, let's, let's take all that money and make commercials that say Hey America, sarcasm might not be such a great thing for your brain.	[]
Randy	7	0	Thank you, doctor. Thank you so much!	[]
Jim Rome	46	0	Jim Rome here. Hey, I love sarcastaball just as much as the next guy, but sometimes it's so thrilling I need an extra burst of energy to get me through a game. That's when I reach for a bottle of this.  Butters' Creamy Goo.	[]
Voice-Over	51	0	You play hard. You need a sports drink that gives you that extra boost.  Sports these days are all about being nice, so take your game to the next level . With Butters' Creamy Goo.  You'll be filled with feelings of good tidings and be nicer than a ray of sunshine.	[]
Butters	2	0	Like me!	[]

Voice-Over	25	0	Butters' Creamy Goo is chock full of all the essentials an athlete needs. Commitment! Compassion! And Comradery! And now it's available in quart size!	[]
Singer	9	0	Go and chug a bottle of Butters' Creamy Goo!	[]
Voice-Over	6	0	Best served just above room temperature.	[]
Butters	23	0	42! Red 13! Sunshine and happy thoughts! Sunshine and happy thoouughts! HUT!  Oh no, that kid's gonna intercept it!  Good job, kid!	[]
Randy	2	0	STAN?! Stan!	[]
Stan	1	0	Dad?	[]
Randy	9	0	Get in the car, Stan! We're going home!	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Sharon	13	0	We're sorry, Stanley, we don't want you playing this sport anymore.	[]
Mr. Mackey	7	0	Hey, get off the field! M'kay?!	[]
Randy	100	2	Everyone! Everyone, listen! There's something you all need to know about sarcastaball. It turns out... it's totally safe.  Yeah, it's super safe! It's like sooo safe that we should have every kid play it-ugh!  Oh! Sorry, sorry. Hang on. Gotta not be so sarcastic. Ahem, let me try that again. Listen everyone... if you let your kids play sarcastaball, you're a fucking genius! Ogh!.. Gyugh! Cut, sorry. Let me try this again.  Look, what I'm trying to say is, we should have like, 10 sarcastaball leagues, because then everyone-! Would-  God damn it!	['fucking', 'damn']
Sharon	12	0	Stanley, just get your things and come on. We're going home!	[]
Stan	12	0	Whoawhoa, you can't, you can't tell me what to do!	[]
Randy	13	0	Yeah, we're your parents! We can't tell you what to do!	[]
Sharon	20	0	Don't you see what this sport has done to your father? Do you want to end up like him?	[]
Stan	11	0	Oh right, like he doesn't exaggerate every disease he gets!	[]
Sharon	5	0	Ohohh Randy, it's happening!	[]
Butters	27	0	Mr. Marsh, listen. I know you care about your son, but he's a heck of a player! He's good at tickling, laughing, and getting along.	[]
Randy	16	0	Look, the point has been made, okay?! I'm warning you, being this sarcastic is dangerous!	[]
Stan	43	0	We're not being sarcastic, Dad! Is it so hard to believe that we really enjoy a sport that has no violence? Is it so hard for you to believe that when Butters says Competitiveness can be compassionate, he's being completely sincere?	[]
Randy	13	0	I don't see how anyone could play this game with any sincerity.	[]
Cartman	28	0	That's because you're too grumpy and negative to believe it. What you need... is a sports drink that can boost your levels of caring and goodness.	[]
Stan	7	0	Yeah Dad. You need some of this.	[]
Randy	3	1	... This is cum.	['cum']
Stephen	64	2	And you can just sit here in your room and think about what you've done!  Just because people try and make football a little safer by changing a kickoff rule doesn't mean YOU need to take it to Oh, who don't we just drink each other's cum?! Sarcasm like that is homophobic, chauvinistic, and completely lacking in maturity! Any questions?!	['cum', 'homophobic']
Butters	7	0	What's sarcasm and what's com?	[]
Stephen	9	0	We'll talk about that when you're older!	[]
Randy	16	0	Come on everybody. Let's work on that kickoff change and get back to some football.	[]
Jim Rome	137	0	Welcome back to Rome. Some of you might have seen me on TV last night. Turns out the drink I endorsed was semen. Turns out a little kid was just bein' sarcastic. That kid's probably grounded for a month. Check that: I'm sure he's grounded for two months. And a week. Football needs to be made safer, so why don't we have players in bras drinking semen? Yeah, that's a fastball right there. That's a real stroke of philosophic genius! More little kids drinking semen to finally bring back real football, and I don't know what else to say but So long, sarcastaball, it was nice knowin' you. Let's just hope nothin' like this ever happens again. Probably won't. Not for another year. Check that: couple of days.	[]
Butters	3	0	DAD! Hey Dad!	[]
Stephen	1	0	What?!	[]
Butters	7	0	My wiener is all stiff and pointy!	[]
Stephen	35	0	Oh, well, Butters, that's just the friendly compass. See, whenever you have friends in the area, your little compass there tells you where they are. It's pointing up because Jesus is your friend.	[]
Butters	2	0	Thanks, Dad.	[]
