Kyle	17	0	Mr. Garrison, didn't the guy who shot John Lennon say it was because of this book?	[]
Mr. Garrison	23	0	Uh-yes, apparently John Lennon's killer said he was inspired by The Catcher In The Rye, but he was just a kook!	[]
Cartman	26	0	Whoa, you're telling us this book is filthy, inappropriate, and made a guy shoot the king of hippies? Can we please read this right now?!	[]

Randy	57	1	Walking out of the house he found a bloody pu- What? He immediately stuck up his im...fected ba-  That was all long ago in some brief lost spring, in a place that is no more. In that hour the vaj frogs begin and the scent off Scrotie's infected anus becomes its strongest. Oh... Oh, man.	['anus']
Sharon	1	0	Well?	[]
Randy	17	0	It's... it's awesome. Sharon it's it's the best book I've ever read.	[]

Cartman	14	0	And if I'm going down, both Kyle and Kenny are definitely going down!	[]
Stan	8	0	Well dude, somebody has got to go down!	[]
Cartman	6	0	Butters, what are you up to?	[]
Butters	9	0	Oh hey fellas. I'm just watching the Kardashians	[]
Kim	15	0	Today my sisters and I are gonna have to wash something. It's gonna blow!	[]
Butters	14	2	Kim Kardashian is sooo sexy. Her butt is like a biiig mountain of pudding.	['sexy', 'butt']
Stan	7	0	Butters, listen: you are in big trouble!	[]
Butters	2	0	I am?	[]
Cartman	12	0	Yeah, you remember that book you wrote? Stan's mom found it.	[]
Butters	6	0	Oh no. Which book was that?	[]
Cartman	13	0	Dude, the book you left with us when you were sleepwalking last night!	[]
Butters	48	0	I don't even remember that.  But it all makes sense now. Ever since I read The Catcher In The Rye I've been having these... blackouts. Crazy thoughts of wanting to kill the phonies. I must have channeled all my angst into dark writings in my sleep!	[]
Sharon	11	0	Alright boys, we need to get to the bottom of this.	[]
Sheila	16	0	We've all read the book now and it is very shocking to say the least.	[]
Stan	10	0	Okay, well... a-actually it was all written by... Butters.	[]
Cartman	3	0	That's right.	[]
Randy	4	0	Butters? Is that true?	[]
Butters	11	0	Yeah, though I barely remember it, but I know I did.	[]
Gerald	16	0	Well Butters, we think... that this is one of the BEST books we've ever read.	[]
Butters	1	0	Huh?	[]
Kyle	1	0	What?	[]
Gerald	5	0	Yeah, it's really amazing.	[]
Butters	2	0	Oh, thanks.	[]
Sheila	20	0	We were actually so moved by your book, Butters, that we brought Mr. Needlebaum from Penguin Publishing to read it.	[]
Mr. Needlebaum	18	0	Mr. Butters, we would like to offer you a deal for first publishing rights to your brilliant novel.	[]
Stan	7	0	Hey, wait a minute, that's ours!	[]
Kyle	4	0	Yeah, we wrote that!	[]
Randy	7	0	Ohkay boys, you already told the truth.	[]
Kyle	12	0	No, no, w-we we really did write it. Tell them, Butters.	[]

News Anchor	46	1	It is being called the most disgusting, foul, sickening book ever written, and it is also being called literary genius.

News Anchor	17	0	The book has already sold millions of copies worldwide aaand has been translated into twenty six languages.	[]

Cartman	10	1	Butters, what the fuck do you think you're doing?!	['fuck']
Butters	5	0	Just enjoying myself. Why, Eric?	[]
Kyle	11	1	Butters, you know goddamned well you didn't write that book!	['goddamned']
Butters	6	0	But, you told me I did!	[]
Stan	14	1	Yeah, but that was when we thought we were gonna get in trouble, asshole!	['asshole']
Red	12	0	Hey hey, you leave Butters alone! He's a very fragile artist.	[]
Lola	8	0	He's so brooding and full of angst.	[]
Butters	4	0	Yeah, I'm broooding.	[]
Cartman	14	1	Butters doesn't deserve any credit for Scrotie McBoogerballs! We deserve all the credit!	['mcboogerballs']
Rebecca	6	0	Oh God, you guys are pathetic!	[]
Lola	12	0	Yeah, get a life and stop mooching off others' success for once.	[]
Stan	2	1	God-damnit!	['damnit']
Kyle	22	0	Butters, do you really think it's fair to lie like this?! Let me tell you, if you don't have the-	[]
Butters	49	0	No, let me tell you somethin', fellers! You always take advantage of me, and after reading The Catcher in the Rye, I've learned you're nothing but phonies! I'm not letting you trick me this time! So the four of you can just suck on my wiener!	[]
Cartman	3	1	That inconsiderate jerk!	['jerk']
Announcer	76	1	Today on Today: We meet the author of the book that has swept the nation, and has now spawned TV's most popular game show, How Long Can You Listen To Scrotie McBoogerballs On Audiobook  And Not Vomit?  The book is full of disgusting words and acts, including Sarah Jessica Parker, who is mentioned four hundred and sixty-five times.  Matthew Broderick, are you upset your wife is made fun of so much in the book?	['mcboogerballs']
Broderick	31	0	Well, obviously. I just think it's wrong to make fun of anybody's physical appearance. My wife is a beautiful woman and I know that most people agree with me.	[]
Announcer	22	0	Uh huh, and Matthew, how come a transvestite donkey witch is standing next to you, and why is it wearing a dress?	[]
Matt Lauer	15	0	Joining us now is the author of the book, Leopold Stotch, along with his parents.	[]
Stephen	2	0	Hello Matt	[]
Linda	2	0	Hi everyone.	[]
Matt Lauer	8	0	You must be pretty proud of your son.	[]
Stephen	14	0	Oh, we certainly are. We're thrilled to learn he's so very talented.	[]
Meredith Vieira	12	0	And we also learned that your son is grounded. Is that correct?	[]
Stephen	15	0	Yes, we did have to ground him for the language in the novel of course.	[]
Butters	10	0	I have to come right to my room after school.	[]
Stephen	7	0	But we are very very proud nonetheless.	[]
Al Roker	15	0	Young man, now that you are a respected author, have you met any famous people?	[]
Butters	24	0	Not yet, but as soon as I'm not grounded anymore, I'm hopin' to meet Kim Kardashian. I wanna jump on her belly.	[]
Matt Lauer	39	1	All right, uh, yeah huh. Butters, my favorite part of your novel was when Scrotie McBoogerballs slid his head up into the horse's  Sorry, I uh, was that chapter a slam on health care reform as people suggested?	['mcboogerballs']
Butters	8	0	Uh... yeah, pretty much, I think, think so.	[]
Meredith Vieira	11	0	Is that why the doctor character pulls out all the strings?	[]
Al Roker	33	0	Little boy, are you ever worried somebody might take your book wrong and try to kill someone, like when that guy tried to shoot Ronald Reagan after reading The Catcher in the Rye?	[]
Butters	18	0	Oh, is that who the book was tellin' me to kill? Ohhh.  Kill Ronald Reagan.  Kill Ronald Reagan.	[]
Al Roker	6	0	Ronald Reagan is dead now, Butters.	[]
Butters	6	0	Oh really?  Oh yeah, gosh dangit.	[]
Stan	49	0	More and more of us are against this book every day! The author is cruel and offensive! And for these reasons, we demand this book be banned from all school, stores, and libraries! This book is nothing but smut and vulgarity purely for the sake of smut and vulgarity!	[]
Assemblyman 1	13	0	That's just because you're too young to understand the underlying themes.	[]
Cartman	11	0	There are no underlying themes! We know that for a fact!	[]
Assemblyman 2	9	0	You just fail to understand what the author meant.	[]
Kyle	13	0	The author meant to be as gross as possible because it was funny!	[]
Assemblyman 3	9	0	No, no no, that's such a simplistic view.	[]
Stan	12	1	Goddamnit there is no deeper meaning in this book! Read it again!	['goddamnit']
Assemblywoman 1	19	0	Oh, so you're suggesting that the author just arbitrarily made fun of Sarah Jessica Parker for no reason?	[]
Kyle	1	0	Yes!	[]
Assemblywoman 1	6	0	But what would be the point?	[]
Cartman	14	1	There is no point! It's just because Sarah Jessica Parker is fuckin' ugly!	['fuckin']
Assemblywoman 2	20	0	No writer would take the time to make fun of Sarah Jessica Parker just because they think she's ugly.	[]
"Stan, Kyle, Cartman"	3	0	Yes they would!	[]
Assemblywoman 2	19	0	It is because Miss Jessica Parker is a metaphor in the book for oppression felt by the lower class.	[]
Stan	10	0	What? Dude, that is not in the book at all!	[]
Assemblyman 2	14	0	Boys, this book is an important look at how liberals are hurting this country.	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Assemblywoman 2	11	1	Wait, Scrotie McBoogerballs is the most conservative-hating liberal in literature!	['mcboogerballs']
Assemblyman 2	5	0	What book did you read?!	[]
Stan	7	0	There's nothing about liberals or conservatives!	[]
Assemblyman 4	17	1	Ohohh yeah, then why did Sarah Jessica Parker's butt-cheese end up in Scrotie's milkshake?	['butt']
Field Reporter	41	0	Breaking news from acclaimed author Leopold Stotch. The artist has announced that he is working on a second novel as a followup to his wildly successful bestseller. We got a statement from the writer, who is still grounded in his room.	[]
Field Reporter	13	0	Can you give the public any idea what the new book is about?	[]
Butters	16	0	Well, it's kind of about love and betrayal! The inner workings of the human mind!	[]
Field Reporter	11	0	Will it be as sick and disgusting as your first book?	[]
Butters	17	0	Oh it's raunchy alright! I know what my readers want, and I'm going to deliver!	[]
Stephen	9	0	Butters, away from the window! You are being grounded!	[]
Butters	11	0	Sorry Dad, I was just bein' the voice of a generation.	[]
Stan	10	0	I can't believe they won't ban our book!	[]
Kyle	13	1	I know! It's so much worse than Catcher in the retarded Rye!	['retarded']
Kenny	4	1	(It's fucking disgusting!)	['fucking']
Cartman	19	0	All right you guys, I know what we have to do.  We've got to kill Sarah Jessica Parker.	[]
Kyle	1	0	What?!	[]
Cartman	31	0	Think about it, guys. If somebody kills Sarah Jessica Parker, then they'll assume that somebody did it because of what was in the book. Then the book will get banned.	[]
Kyle	8	0	Dude, we're not killing Sarah Jessica Parker!	[]
Cartman	19	0	Shhh.  Be right with you.  We don't have to kill her, we can just help her get killed.	[]
Stan	10	0	Shut up, Cartman! Just face it. We lost this one.	[]
Cartman	17	0	Kenny... we only have to help her get killed and then we totally get back at Butters.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Okay.)	[]
Cartman	5	0	Ms. Jessica Parker, over here.	[]
Matt	27	1	Well, the day has finally arrived. The eagerly awaited second novel from the author of Scrotie McBoogerballs hit the shelves this morning and apparently, bookstores are jammed.	['mcboogerballs']
Meredith	6	0	Al, how is it out there?	[]
Al	54	0	I don't know if you could see this, guys, but uh, the line stretches all the way around the block. People waiting for their turn to get inside the bookstore and read the novel.  And they brought trash bags and buckets to throw up in. Just a festive atmosphere here, Matt and Meredith.	[]
Meredith	18	0	Well, we've got our vomit buckets ready too, because coming up, a very special in-studio treat.	[]
Matt	59	0	That's right, we are going to have a reading of the first five chapters of the book here live in our studio. Na-now we must warn you that this is from the same author who wrote the most graphic, obscene novel of all time, so... brace yourselves for some very harsh language. Take it away Morgan Freeman.	[]
Morgan Freeman	82	12	The Poop That Took A Pee Chapter 1: Douglas had to poop. His butt was all stinky because he had to poop so badly. There was a gross woman named Rebecca who was sunbathing all naked, and she was fat. Douglas walked up to her and said, I need to poop. Okay, Rebecca replied, I like poop. Douglas squatted down  over the fat sunbathing lady and went poop. The poop sat there on Rebecca's boobs looking like a wiener.  Chapter 2...

Cartman	10	0	Doing good, Ms. Jessica Parker! Just hang out, right there.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Guys, stop, stop!  We don't have to do this!	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Huh?)	[]
Kyle	5	0	Butters wrote a second book!	[]
Cartman	2	0	So what?	[]
Stan	21	0	So dude, if Butters wrote a second book, then everyone's gonna know he couldn't have written the first one!	[]
Kyle	8	0	We can get people to believe us now!	[]
Cartman	3	0	Oh dude, sweet!	[]
Morgan Freeman	28	3	Why are we here? Douglas cried as poop came out his wiener, in a long, thin strip. It was... wiener poop, which is the grossest poop of all.	['poop', 'poop', 'poop']
Shopper 1	16	1	The pee he got on the woman's leg, and she screamed, pooping out her boobs.	['boobs']
Shopper 2	15	2	And so when the pee got mixed with the poop, it smelled like a butt.	['poop', 'butt']
Stan	9	0	Aw dude, this is even lamer than we thought.	[]
Cartman	9	0	People are gonna want Butters' head on a platter!	[]
Shopper 3	9	0	Are you reading this, Marsha? What do you think?	[]
Marsha	18	0	So far I think it's, it's incredible! Ih, it might be better than his first book.	[]
Shopper 4	19	0	I agree. It wasn't as edgy, but it's like, he he's gone back to his roots.	[]
Cartman	1	0	What?!	[]
Stan	9	0	You can't be serious! You people like this?!	[]
Shopper 5	6	0	Some of the imagery is unbelievable	[]
Kyle	10	1	A woman pooping out her boobs is not good imagery!	['boobs']
Shopper 6	19	0	Says you! You must be a pro-life nut, huh?  Didn't like what the book had to say?	[]
Marsha	14	0	What are you talking about? This book is as pro-life as it gets!	[]
Cartman	3	0	Oh come on!	[]
Stan	13	1	God-damnit, will you people stop reading into stuff that isn't there!!	['damnit']
Shopper 7	18	1	And the poop and the pee lived happily every after. The end.  Kill the phonies. Kill the phonies!	['poop']
Kim	10	0	Today my sisters and I are gonna shop for underwear.	[]
The Kardashians	1	0	Yaaay!	[]
Male Guest	6	0	Can I go with you girls?	[]
News Anchor 2	61	2	Our nation is still reeling from the tragic deaths of the Kardashians. The shooter claims he was driven to commit the slaughter immediately after reading The Poop That Took A Pee by Leopold Butters Stotch. It's all over. The Kardiashians..  wiped out. In the blink of an eye. All because one little PRICK... had to go and write a book.	['poop', 'prick']
News Anchor 2	10	1	Leopold Stotch... I HOPE THEY BURY YOU! ...YOU EVIL FUCK!	['fuck']
Cartman	8	0	Dude, people are pissed off at you, Butters.	[]
Butters	2	0	I know.	[]
Stan	19	0	They're saying they're gonna ban both your books now, completely. You're not making any more money!	[]
Butters	29	0	You think I care about that? My writing got the most beautiful woman in the world killed! I loved her! And if she died it was because of me!	[]
Kyle	36	0	Ah... Oh Butters,  it'll be all right. Listen, we've all learned that people look for meaning in books. And sometimes, even if it isn't there, they'll try and invent their own meaning.	[]
Stan	16	0	Yeah, dude, eh, that's why we all need to avoid books and stick to television.	[]
Butters	16	0	Thang, thanks, fellas. I'll definitely never write again. I think I can get over this.	[]
Cartman	11	0	That's good, Butters, because, we need to tell you something.	[]
Butters	1	0	What?	[]
Cartman	27	0	You were sleepwalking again and dressed Sarah Jessica Parker up in a moose suit. You left her in the forest and she got shot by a hunter.	[]
Butters	3	0	What?! Oh no!	[]
Cartman	14	0	Yep, sorry. You're gonna have to come down and admit it was you.	[]
Butters	16	0	Aw. Aw I got her killed too? Aw uh, oh well, at least she was ugly.	[]
