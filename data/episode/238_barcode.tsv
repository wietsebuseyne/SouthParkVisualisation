Cartman	13	0	Oh yes. Sooo this is where the government checks up on its citizens.	[]
Chief	43	0	There's a lot of people working here at the NSA. Good people, people who just wanna keep America safe. Only problem is, checking all those e-mails, Twitter accounts, and surveilling all those phone calls can take a lot of manpower._	[]

Joe	12	0	We wanna talk to you about some tweets you've been tweeting.	[]
Hippie	28	0	Hey man, I was just blowin' smoke. Say, what right does the government have reading my private e-mails anyway?! Haven't you squares heard of the Constitution?	[]
Joe	154	2	Yeah, we've heard of that. We've also heard of the Declaration of Independence. See, there's a lot of people out there who think like you, people who think their government doesn't have the right to go around poking their noses in the e-mails of its citizens. That is, until a plane flies into a couple of towers and a little girl loses her life. You wanna live in the Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave, but the brave can't be free if the land isn't home, and that land won't be home so long as folks out there wanna take that American flag and shove it so far up your anus that you crap stars and stripes for a week, and as you're sittin' there on the toilet with the Star-Spangled Montezuma's Revenge there's one thing I_can_guarantee you.

Craig	2	0	...Okay._	[]
Butters	27	0	You see, Craig, once I came clean with the government, I no longer had anything to hide. Then I found peace. Have you read any DMV literature?	[]
Craig	2	0	Aaaaaaaaaaaahh, no.	[]
Butters	26	0	Well, there's a lot of interesting stuff in here, Craig. There's even some quotes from President Obama.__Could you read this part out lout?	[]

Pamphleteer	103	0	Yes sir.__See, i used to be like you. I go around sending them nasty e-mails and a nasty texts, puttin' nasty picture on my nasty Facebook.

Alec Baldwin	6	1	Some little faggot in my head.	['faggot']
Cartman	25	0	Hey, so um, as I'm going through people's e-mails and phone calls, um, how do I know which people to start with?	[]
Detective 3	27	0	Pretty simple. Everyone has a file. People who have a status of threat, possible threat, or person of interest are the ones we really wanna look at.	[]
Detective 4	12	0	The more we pay attention to them, the bigger their file becomes.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Really? How big is my file?	[]
Detective 4	1	0	Huh?	[]
Cartman	28	0	Uhh, that us, uhh, yo-you must have a pretty big file on Eric Cartman. All his blogs and e-mails have been watched for quite some time.	[]
Detective 3	14	0	Jarvis, what have we got on an Eric Cartman? Any files on Eric Cartman.	[]
Jarvis	19	1	Ohhh yeah, we tracked him for a little bit, but Central Computer designated his status as fat and unimportant.	['fat']

Chief Joe	6	0	Not according to the Central Computer.	[]
Cartman	11	0	The Central Computer is wrong! You need to change his status!	[]
Chief Joe	18	0	Sorry,__but if Central Computer says he is not a threat, then we can't do anything._	[]
Cartman	8	0	Can't do anything?? You're the NSA!	[]
Chief Joe	38	0	There's 300 million people out there. How do you think we're able to keep track of every single person in the country? How do you think we're able to really know who's doing what?	[]
Cartman	4	0	I don't know.	[]
Chief Joe	42	0	Alright, I'll show you. But this is very top security stuff, because if people knew how we did it, then everyone would do it. Then our enemies would do it. We can't let our enemies get their hands on this.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Get their hands on what?__Dude..._	[]
Chief Joe	28	0	This is how we know who's a threat and who's not. How we know who's sleeping and who's awake._ How we know that...	[]

Larry	111	0	No... No, leave them alone. It's a nice change to see people happy here at the DMV.__Perhaps we here at the DMV can start changing as well. Perhaps instead of treating people badly we can offer them comfort and hope. Why, the DMV can be a place where people come to get things off their chests. Confess, yes, but also be told that they're worth something in this world! And then, DMVs everywhere can become a place where people feel safe. And when they do something wrong we can offer forgiveness! Don't you see what this could lead to? Don't you see what we could become??	[]
