Cartman	13	1	Oh, dude! I just took the biggest crap. Hey-where are you guys?	['crap']
Kyle	7	0	We're over here, by the cart.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Okay, I'm back.	[]
Stan	6	0	Dude! We've been waiting forever!	[]
Cartman	10	0	Well, I'm sorry, I had to take a dump!	[]
Kyle	16	0	If you didn't eat so much, you wouldn't have diarrhea all the time, fatass!	[]
Cartman	13	0	Hey, I don't need to take any lip from a frickin' girl!	[]
Kenny	7	1	(I think Kyle has fake titties, hahahaha)	['titties']
Cartman	3	0	Heheh, totally, heheh.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Come on, we have to finish the quest in Stonehaven.	[]
Randy	2	0	Stan?  Stan?	[]
Stan	8	0	H-hang on, guys, my dad wants something.	[]
Randy	1	0	Stan!	[]
Stan	1	0	What?!	[]
Randy	18	0	You've been on your computer all weekend. Shouldn't you go out and socialize with your friends?	[]
Stan	27	0	I am socializing, r-tard. I'm logged on to an MMORPG with people from all over the world, and getting XP with my party using TeamSpeak.	[]
Randy	6	0	...I'm not a r-tard.	[]
Stan	8	0	All right, sorry guys. So where to now?	[]
Kyle	8	0	See where I am? It's this way.	[]
Cartman	15	0	Yeah, come on, let's go!  I am the mightiest dwarf in all of Azeroth!	[]
Kyle	9	0	Wow, look at all these people playing right now.	[]
Cartman	14	1	Yeah, it's bullcrap. I'll bet half these of these people are Koreans.	['bullcrap']
Stan	7	1	Oh crap! It's that guy again!	['crap']
Kyle	3	0	Who is this?	[]
Stan	13	0	This is the guy that kept killing us after you went to bed!	[]
Cartman	5	1	Get out of here, asshole!	['asshole']
Stan	12	0	He's a way higher level than us. It isn't fair.	[]
Kyle	14	0	It's all right. He can't kill us unless we agree to duel.	[]
Stan	6	0	Oh my God, he killed Kenny!	[]
Kyle	2	1	You bastard!	['bastard']
Cartman	26	0	Don't you have better things to do than going online killing people?!  No! I don't want them to start over at the graveyard!  No!	[]
Cartman	2	1	That sonofabitch!	['sonofabitch']
Kyle	4	0	Who is that guy?	[]
Stan	8	1	Whoever he is, he is one tough badass.	['badass']
Rep	5	0	World of Warcraft support line.	[]
Stan	23	0	Yeah, we bought your game, and played it online, but every time we log in, some other player comes in and kills us!	[]
Rep	25	0	O..ohhh that shouldn't happen. We designed the game so that players have to agree to a duel before they can kill each other.	[]
Stan	7	0	Yeah? Well this guy does it anyway!	[]
Cartman	6	2	He's a God damned butthole!	['damned', 'butthole']
Rep	13	0	Really? That's odd.  More people calling in about their characters getting killed.	[]
Co-Worker	2	0	Oh no.	[]
Rep	22	0	Well, we'll certainly keep a look out for that player and ban him from the network.  Better tell the guys upstairs.	[]
President	26	0	Fellow board members, we have a problem: somebody in the World of Warcraft is ignoring the World's rules...and is going around killing innocent players..	[]
Member 1	10	0	Why kill innocent players? The game is about finishing quests.	[]
Member 2	9	0	We've got to delete him from the servers.	[]
President	38	0	We can't. Whoever this player is, he has played World of Warcraft so much, that he has reached a level we thought unreachable. He's actually able to kill our admins. And he grows stronger every day.	[]
Member 3	1	0	Jesus...	[]
Jim	14	0	I've gotta get home! My kids are playing World of Warcraft right now!	[]
President	7	0	Jim, your kids' characters are already dead.	[]
Jim	6	0	No...  No...  They just started playing!	[]
Member 2	7	0	What kind of person would do this?	[]
President	38	0	Only one kind. Whoever this player is, he has played World of Warcraft nearly every hour of every day for the past year and a half. Gentlemen, we are dealing with someone here who...haw absolutely no life.	[]
Member 3	9	0	How do you kill...that which has no life?	[]
Nelson	7	1	Randy, you workin' on that sediment analysis?	['analysis']
Randy	22	0	Not now, Nelson. I just joined a big party of night elves and we're gonna explore the Tower of Azora together.	[]
Nelson	5	0	Is that a computer game?	[]
Randy	72	0	No, r-tard, it's an MMORPG. These are real people I'm playing with. See, I'm a hunter, level 2.  I can chat with all these other people. I can even wave to this guy, see?  Hello.  In the outside world, I'm a simple geologist, but in here...I am Falcorn, Defender of the Alliance. I've braved the Fargodeep mine and defeated the Bloodfish at Jarod's Landing.	[]
Nelson	8	0	Hm. Looks like that guy just killed you.	[]
Randy	3	0	What?? Why?? Why?!	[]
Cartman	18	1	My friends: as you all know, some giant butthole keeps logging onto Warcraft and killing all our characters.	['butthole']
Kyle	15	0	The past...four nights we've tried to play, he shows up and kills us!	[]
Craig	11	0	He killed my character right in the middle of a quest!	[]
Tweek	2	0	Mine too!	[]
Cartman	25	0	We've learned that the four of us can't fight him alone. But, if we all log in together!, we might have a chance.	[]
Token	2	0	Hey yeah!	[]
Jimmy	10	0	We can really stick it to that assm-m-muncher!	[]
Clyde	20	0	Are you guys dumb? We can't beat him, even with all of us. It's a waste of time.	[]
Stan	5	0	Ddue, we have to try.	[]
Clyde	7	0	I've got better things to do.	[]
Cartman	40	0	Clyde, Clyde!  If you had a chance right now to go back in time and stop Hitler, wouldn't you do it?  I mean, I personally wouldn't stop him because I think he was awesome, but you would, right?	[]
Clyde	6	0	I'm just gonna stop playing.	[]
Cartman	27	0	When Hitler rose to power there were a lot of people who just stopped playing. You know who those people were? The French! Are you French, Clyde?	[]
Clyde	1	0	No.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, Clyde?	[]
Clyde	8	0	All right all right, I'll do it!	[]
Jimmy	6	0	So what's the p-plan?	[]
Cartman	29	0	All right, you all login from your computers at precisely 7:30.  We will meet here, on the plains of the elven forest near Westfall. My friends, to victory!	[]
All	2	0	To victory!	[]
Butters	7	0	I don't play World of Warcraft.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Butters, you said you were on your computer all the time!	[]
Butters	9	0	Yeah, but I'm playing Hello Kitty Island Adventure.	[]
Cartman	21	0	Butters, go buy World of Warcraft, install it on your computer, and join the online sensation before we all murder you.	[]
Butters	9	0	O-oh, o-oh, a-alright. All right then.	[]
Cartman	27	0	All right, you guys, this is it! When the attack begins, all warriors click on defensive stance. Everyone else, wait for Craig to cast his intellect buff.	[]
Token	1	0	Okay.	[]
Jason	2	0	Got it.	[]
Cartman	20	0	The battle is sure to be long, so make sure you all have your special abilities macroed to your keyboards.	[]
Jimmy	10	0	All right, Eric. You can c-c-count on us.	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmy!	[]
Cartman	19	0	This shall be a day for all to remember! Let us bravely charge the fields of Azeroth!  From with-	[]
Butters	7	0	Hey fellas!  Boy, this is neato, huh?	[]
Cartman	7	1	Butters? What the hell are you doing?	['hell']
Butters	8	0	I got World of Warcraft, like you said.	[]
Cartman	12	0	You can't be the dwarf character, Butters, I'm the dwarf.	[]
Butters	10	0	Well, there's only like four races to choose from-	[]
Cartman	21	1	So pick another one! I'm the dwarf, you stupid asshole! Log out, create a new character, and log back in!	['asshole']
Butters	12	0	I like Hello Kitty Island Adventure a lot more 'n this stuff.	[]
Stan	6	0	Come on, let's do this!	[]
Craig	13	0	Yeah, my mom says I have to be in bed at 9:30.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Then let's move out!	[]
Stan	4	0	Look! There he is!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Everyone hold!	[]
Kyle	4	0	He's targeting us.	[]
Cartman	20	0	Prepare to charge! Scroll over him with your mouse cursors! And...Right-click!  What the? Oh Jesus, he summoned scorpions!	[]
Tweek	9	0	Aaaa!  I'm burning! Oh Jesus I'm burning!	[]
Jimmy	8	0	Kenny's down. K-k-kenny is down.	[]
Ike	6	1	I have poop on my pants.	['poop']
Kyle	3	0	Ike, look out!	[]
Cartman	22	2	All right, Clyde, hit him with your crossbow!  Hit him now, Clyde! Clyde? Clyde!  Clyde! Clyde, you asshole!  Goddamnit we lost Clyde!	['asshole', 'goddamnit']
Randy	8	0	Hey, Stan, can I play with you guys?	[]
Stan	1	0	Dad??	[]
Randy	7	0	Yeah, I'm playing from the office.	[]
Stan	6	0	Dad, get off our teamspeak line!	[]
Token	6	0	That's it, I'm dead!	[]
Stan	6	0	That's it, screw this game!	[]
Cartman	12	2	Now, leave me alone, don't do-  that, dugh  God-fucking-damnit!!!	['fucking', 'damnit']
Member 3	5	0	Oh Jesus...Oh God no...	[]
President	1	0	What?	[]
Member 3	11	0	He just finished killing every single player in the Arathi Highlands.	[]
Member 1	8	0	How many people's characters were in there?	[]
Member 2	3	0	Over five thousand.	[]
Member 1	36	0	There are over seven million people who log on to World of Warcraft! Are you telling me all those people's characters are going to die, and there's nothing we can do to save them?	[]
President	31	0	Yes. And it won't be long before everyone gets really really frustrated and stops playing altogether. Gentlemen, this could very well lead to the end of the World...of Warcraft.	[]
Member 5	2	0	No! Nooooooooo!	[]
Cartman	19	1	What the hell are you guys doing?? Don't tell me you all quit playing World of Warcraft too?!	['hell']
Stan	13	0	Dude, we're done. we're sick of getting killed all the time.	[]
Cartman	16	0	Guys, when things look bad, you can't just give up on the world. Of Warcraft.	[]
Kyle	14	0	We don't have a choice, dude. That guy killed our characters 14 times.	[]
Cartman	29	0	I have a solution, you guys. That guy can kill us so easily because he's a super-high level, right? What if we were super-high level too?	[]
Stan	17	0	We can't get to a higher level because that dude doesn't let us finish quests!	[]
Cartman	16	0	That's why we just need to log in and stay in the forest, killing boars.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Boars?	[]
Cartman	15	0	There's lots of computer-generated boars in Warcraft that die with just one blow.	[]
Kyle	24	0	Dude, boars are only worth two experience points apiece. Do you know how many we would have to kill to get up 30 levels?	[]
Cartman	69	0	Yes.  Sixty-five million three hundred and forty thousand two hundred and eighty five. Which should take us seven weeks five days thirteen hours and twenty minutes, giving ourselves three hours a night to sleep. What do you say, guys? You can just...you can just hang outside in the sun all day tossin' a ball around,  or you can sit at your computer and do somethin' that matters.	[]
Paul Stanley	46	0	Live to win, 'till you die, 'till the light dies in your eyes!Live to win, take it all, just keep fighting till you fall!Day by day, kickin' all the way, I'm not cavin' inLet another round begin, live to winYeah! Live! Yeah!Win!	[]
Member 3	22	0	Sir, you'd better have a look at this! Four of our subscribers...They've gone up fifty levels in three weeks.	[]
President	9	0	My God...they must have no lives at all.	[]
Member 3	2	0	A hope?	[]
President	2	0	A chance.	[]

Kyle	6	0	Dude, my mouse-clicking finger hurts.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Keep clicking, Kyle! You can do it!	[]
President	14	0	The admins tell us they are four players from a small town in Colorado.	[]
Member 1	9	0	Are they strong enough to defeat the Evil One?	[]
Member 5	24	0	We ran the numbers: even with their amazing rise in levels, they have a 90% mortality probability. They'd be walking in a slaughter!	[]
Member 1	9	0	There has to be...someway we can help them.	[]
Member 6	8	0	What about...the Sword of a Thousand Truths?	[]
Member 7	11	0	Quiet, Thomas! We aren't even to speak of that sword!	[]
Thomas	12	0	But maybe these new players are the ones the prophecy foretold of.	[]
Member 7	5	0	It is not an option!	[]
Thomas	4	0	What is this sword?	[]
President	48	0	Long ago, when the World of Warcraft was created, one of the programmers put a sword called the Sword of a Thousand Truths into the game inventory. Apparently it could cause 120 damage per second, with an instant mana burn and an enchantment that boosts its stamina +80.	[]
Member 7	28	0	But the sword was considered to be too powerful for anyone to possess. So it was removed from the game and stored on a one-gig flash drive.	[]
Thomas	16	0	But it was foretold that one day, players who could wield the sword might reveal themselves.	[]
Member 1	4	0	Who foretold this prophecy?	[]
President	5	0	Soltzman. He's an accountant.	[]
President	39	0	Behold, the Sword of a Thousand Truths.  We must get this sword to the ones who have proven they have no life. Let's just hope to Christ they don't start the battle before we can reach them.	[]
Cartman	20	0	All right, you guys. The Moment of Truth is here. It is time for our final battle. Everyone, log in!	[]
Stan	3	0	I'm in.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Me too.	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Me too.)	[]
Cartman	24	0	Everyone equip healing potions to the hotbar if you haven't already. Uh, Kyle, go ahead and cast Arcane Brilliance to raise our intelligence.	[]
Kyle	11	0	Hang on, I'm chaining my fire spells for max range.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Nice. Stan, what enchantment does your Cloak of the Tiger have?	[]
Stan	2	0	15 agility.	[]
Cartman	13	0	Give the cloak to Kenny, he needs the agility boost for bow attacks.	[]
Stan	1	0	'K.	[]
Kyle	17	0	Hold on, this fight could last more than twelve hours. What if we run out of food?	[]
Cartman	8	0	Don't worry, I have that covered.  Mom?	[]
Liane	2	0	Yes hon?	[]
Cartman	3	0	More Hot Pockets!	[]
Liane	3	0	Right away, hon.	[]
Stan	3	0	That's ubercool.	[]
Cartman	4	0	All right, everyone ready?	[]
Kyle/Stan	1	0	Ready.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Let's go get him!	[]
Stan	13	0	Wait, I think I see him. Yeah, yeah, he's here in Goldshire.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Okay, everyone open your uplifts and autolocate to Stan.	[]
Kyle	5	0	What's the autolocate macro?	[]
Cartman	2	0	Command-0.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Okay, right behind Stan.	[]
Cartman	17	0	Kenny, get ready to turn on true-shot aura. At that moment, I will use intimidating shout.	[]
Stan	8	0	Okay, he sees us...He's targeted us.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Okay, hit him with pyroblast, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	8	0	Casting...there's an 8-second cast time.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Aren't you spec'd to reduce cast time?	[]
Kyle	8	0	No, ah, I'm an arcane fire mage.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Christ...	[]
Kyle	4	0	Cast on him again.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Everyone target scorpions.	[]
Randy	1	0	Yes?	[]
Member 1	12	0	We are looking for a great knight by the name of LovesToSpooge.	[]
Randy	10	0	That's my son's character's name in Warcraft.	[]
President	3	0	Where is he?!	[]
Randy	3	0	Who are you?	[]
President	21	0	Sir, we don't have time! We just heard from our admins that your son's party is already in battle!	[]
Member 1	13	0	Unless they have this sword,  your son's character is going to die!	[]
Randy	4	0	Nn-Oh my God!	[]
Cartman	3	0	Kyle! Fire spell!	[]
Kyle	3	0	Aaaa...  AH! Huh?!	[]
Stan	6	0	Kyle!  Kyle! Dude, what's wrong?	[]
Kyle	7	0	Carpal tunnel! Carpal tunnel! It's aaaah!	[]
Stan	7	0	Oh, Jesus, he's got it bad!	[]
Cartman	5	1	Wait, we need Ben-Gay.	['gay']
Stan	2	0	Hurry dude!	[]
Cartman	8	0	I'm going as fast as I can!	[]
Stan	6	0	Kyle, you have to keep playing.	[]
Kyle	7	0	I can't. Just leave me behind.	[]
Stan	10	0	We can't do this without you now! Come on!	[]
Randy	6	0	Stan?! Stan!  Sharon, where is Stan?!	[]
Sharon	15	0	I don't know. He took his computer somewhere to play that stupid online game.	[]
Member 1	1	0	Stupid?	[]
Randy	1	0	Where?!	[]
Sharon	4	0	I don't know.	[]
Randy	14	0	Sharon, his character is going to die if we don't get to him!	[]
Sharon	2	0	So what?	[]
The three men	2	0	So what?!	[]
President	11	0	We're too late. Without the sword the players will fail.	[]
Member 1	24	0	Ih if we could get to a computer, we could sign on to the World of Warcraft and give the boys the sword online.	[]
President	11	0	I don't have a World of Warcraft account. Do you?	[]
Member 1	5	0	No, I have a life.	[]
Randy	4	0	Give me the sword.	[]
Member 1	1	0	You?	[]
Randy	21	0	I have a Warcraft character. I'm a newb, but I can log on and get the sword to Stan online.	[]
Member 1	13	0	We can't trust the Sword of a Thousand Truths to a newb!	[]
Randy	27	0	Sounds to me like we don't have a choice! Give me the sword.  Ahhhh. Come on, we've got to get to a computer that works!	[]
Randy	4	0	Where's your car?	[]
Member 1	5	0	We took a cab here!	[]
Randy	38	1	Damnit, mine's in the shop!  Uh hey! Eh help! Stop!  Please, it's an emergency!  Nelson! Nelson, I need to come over and use your computer! No, I d-I need to play World of Warcraft! NELSON!	['damnit']
Cartman	19	0	All right, major stone shield potions should be...Oh God, I'm going to have diarrhea again. Ohhh...Duuuh...	[]
Stan	12	0	You can't go to the bathroom, you're stacking sunder armor!	[]
Cartman	5	0	It's okay.  Mom? Bathroom!	[]
Liane	2	0	What hon?	[]
Cartman	2	0	Bathroom! Bathroom!	[]
Liane	9	0	Oohh, that's a big boy, isn't he?	[]
Cartman	17	0	All right, Kenny, drink your elixir of the mongoose. I'm now going to use mocking blow.	[]

Greeter	9	0	Our demo is set up right over by the-	[]
Randy	11	0	Got to...sign in...character name...All right, I'm in!	[]

Cartman	4	0	Kyle, cast arcane missile!	[]
Kyle	8	0	I'm out of mana, I told you.	[]
Stan	4	0	I've gotta heal.	[]
Randy	1	0	Staaan!	[]
Stan	3	0	Dad? Not now!	[]
Randy	17	0	Stan! I've been sent here...to bring you this.  This sword can completely drain his mana.	[]
Stan	6	0	Dad, how did you get that?!	[]
Randy	17	0	No time! Just take it! Here!  ...How, how do you hand something from one player to another?	[]
Stan	7	0	Bring up your inventory screen: Control-I...	[]
Randy	1	0	Okay.	[]
Cartman	7	1	Stan, what the hell are you doing?!	['hell']
Stan	3	0	I got it!	[]

Cartman	11	0	What do you mean? Now we can finally play the game.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Oh yeah.	[]
Cartman	19	0	Okay Kenny, add Eyes of the Beast to your hotbar. Stan, check your fury talents to boost your shots.	[]
Stan	2	0	Got it.	[]
