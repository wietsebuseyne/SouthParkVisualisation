Cartman	32	0	Hello, ma'am. I'm working to clean up the neighborhood from parasites. Do you mind if I take a quick look around your house? I'm afraid you may have hippies.	[]
Elderly Woman	1	0	Hippies?	[]
Cartman	43	0	Yeah, they've been poppin' up all over the neighborhood lately. Ms. Nelson next door had seven hippies in her basement; they usually live in colonies.  Hm, I don't like the sound of that. Could I take a look in your attic?	[]
Cartman	13	0	Oh yeah, boy. Take a look at this, ma'am.  See that? Hippies.	[]
Elderly Woman	2	0	Oh my.	[]
Cartman	43	0	These are what we call the uh giggling stoners. Pretty common form of hippie, usually found in the attics. Problem is, if you see one hippie, there's probably a whole lot more you're not seein'. Uh, whe-where's the backyard.	[]
Cartman	17	0	Yep, that's what I thought. See that? You've got a drum circle in your backyard.	[]
Elderly Woman	18	0	Oh, well they showed up a few days ago, but I didn't think they were hurting anything.	[]
Cartman	46	0	Yeah. You know, I had a guy in Jackson County. He had a little drum circle in his backyard. It turned into a drum circle four miles in diameter. You get a few hippies playing drums and next thing you know, you got yourself a colony.	[]
Elderly Woman	2	0	Oh dear.	[]
Elderly Woman	8	0	Oh, well, so, so what do I do?	[]
Cartman	22	1	Well, your attic could be so we can fumigate with polymarethane. The drum circle we're gonna have to gas.  God dammit!	['dammit']
Hippie 1	11	0	Whoa, how did I get here? Man, I'm so high.	[]
Cartman	3	1	God damn hippie!	['damn']
Hippie 1	2	0	Whoa, dude!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Get out of here!	[]
Hippie 1	5	0	Not cool!  What's up?!	[]
Cartman	26	0	Ma'am, I need to clear out your giggling stoners and your drum-circle hippies RIGHT NOW, or soon they're gonna attract something much worse!	[]
Elderly Woman	4	0	Ooooo...what's that?	[]
Cartman	6	0	The college know-it-all hippies.	[]
Driver	13	0	Wow, my friend Brittany was right. This is a really laid-back place.	[]
Woman 1	11	0	Yeah, this will be a great place to spend spring break.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Hey, let's ask them.	[]
Stan	31	0	All right.  'Scuse me.  Hello, we are selling magazine subscriptions for our community youth program. Would you like to help young people like us by purchasing a subscription of your choice?	[]
Driver	20	0	Oh wow, you guys shouldn't be doing that. Don't you know what you're doing to the world?	[]
Kyle	3	0	Wha- whataya mean?	[]
Man 1	25	0	You're playing into the corporate game! See, the corporations are trying to turn you into little Eichmann's so that they can make money.	[]
Stan	4	0	Who are the corporations?	[]
Woman 2	15	0	The corporations run the entire world. And now they fooled you into working for them.	[]
Stan	7	0	Are you serious? We never heard that.	[]
Driver	30	0	We just spent our first semester at college. Our professors opened our eyes. The government is using its corporate ties to make you sell magazines so they can get rich.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Ugh! Those dirty liars!	[]
Kenny	1	1	(Sonofabitch!)	['sonofabitch']
Man 2	23	0	This is a really nice town you have here. That's why the corporations are trying to use you to take it down.	[]
Stan	6	0	Well... Well what do we do?	[]
Driver	19	0	Just hang with us for a bit. We'll fill you in on everything you haven't been told.	[]
Hippie 2	17	0	It is time to let us out! I'm sending your names! Open this door right now!	[]
Cartman	5	0	All right, in you go.	[]
Hippie 2	5	0	What are you doing, man?!	[]
Hippie 3	3	0	Let us out!	[]
Cartman	11	0	Get back. Get back or you're all gonna get maced!	[]
Hippie 2	13	0	What's up, man?! You can't keep us down here like this!	[]
Hippie 4	5	0	What's wrong with you?!	[]
Cartman	21	0	What's wrong is that there's more of you showing up every day and I need to find out why!	[]
Hippie 5	11	0	What makes you think you could tell us where to live?!	[]
Hippie 6	6	0	This is a free country, man!	[]
Cartman	14	0	Brah, I'm not gonna argue with you, all right? Just go with it.	[]
Hippie 3	11	0	Just go with it? We've been down here for days!	[]
Cartman	20	0	And you're gonna be here a little longer, brah, all right? Here, here's some joints , and a guitar!	[]
Singer	29	0	What's goin' on in this world o'mine?There's a whole lot of killin' in this world o'mine. Somebody's gotta help this world o'mine...	[]
Stan	8	0	Sign, sign everywhere. SignDone something to my mind.	[]
Sharon	13	0	Stan, sweetie, we're gonna go to the mall. Do you wanna come?	[]
Stan	27	1	Mom, the mall is a way for the corporate fat cats to imprison you into a life of servitude. I've got some stuff you should read.	['fat']
Sharon	2	0	Okay, sweetie.	[]
Mayor McDaniels	10	0	All right, people, we can move onto issue number 14B.	[]
Chef	14	0	Mayor, we have got to do somethin' about all these potholes on our roads!	[]
Linda Stotch	13	0	We don't have it in the budget to fix them right now.	[]
Gerald	15	0	We'll wish we spent the money when we have a lawsuit on our hands.	[]
Chef	1	0	We-	[]
Guard	6	0	You can't go in there!	[]
Cartman	10	0	Please, I have to talk to you all right now!	[]
Mayor McDaniels	8	0	Kid, we're have a city council meeting.	[]
Cartman	29	0	Mayor, something very big is happening, and if you all don't give me a moment of your time, there may be no more South Park to council over!	[]
Randy	5	0	What are you talking about?	[]
Cartman	99	0	I'm talking about the end of all life as we know it.  For the past several days I've been... noticing a steep rise in the number of hippies coming to town.  At first I thought maybe it was just a coincidence.  Then I saw this...  Three new drum circles have sprouted up here, here, and here. They're all growing in diameter, at a rate of two hippies per hour. What this means... is that the hippies are conglomerating. They're thriving, if you will. I think that they're setting up for a... . hippie music festival.	[]
Linda	2	0	A what?	[]
Cartman	86	0	It's, it's simple science. Look: When hippies start to nest in a new area, it draws other hippies in. With the right weather conditions and topography, it can lead to a music festival. One that last for days, even weeks. Reggae on the River, Woodstock, Burning Man, they will all pale in comparison to what we're looking at now. In my professional opinion... I think we're looking at a full-blown hippie jam festival the size of which we've never seen.	[]
Mayor McDaniels	8	1	Kid, what the hell are you talking about?	['hell']
Cartman	44	0	I know hippies. I've hated them all my life. I've kept this town free of hippies on my own since I was five and a half. But I can't contain them on my own anymore. We have to do something, fast!	[]
Mr. Mackey	13	0	Uh, Eric, we're, we're talkin' about potholes right now, m'kay.	[]
Cartman	20	0	It's not potholes you need to worry about. It's potheads. I know what these people are capable of. '	[]
Mayor McDaniels	6	0	Johnson, get him out of here.	[]
Cartman	25	0	What are you doing?!  You have to listen to me! You can't sweep this problem under the rug!  The town is in serious danger!	[]
Driver	18	0	You see, the corporations take their profits and invest it in the war machine while keeping everyone blind.	[]
Stan	9	0	Right, so how do we get back at them?	[]
Kyle	5	0	Yeah, we're pissed off.	[]
Driver	31	1	Well, so my idea was this: Let's have like a week long music festival, draw everyone here, and then together, we can tear it all down.  Whoa, what the hell?!	['hell']
Cartman	24	1	I knew you were trying to have a hippie jam festival! All right, everyone pack up your crap, we're going to our basement!	['crap']
Kyle	7	1	Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!	['hell']
Cartman	20	0	Oh Jesus, not you guys?  What happened? Were you bit? Did you eat their brownies? DID YOU EAT THEIR BROWNIES?!	[]
Stan	1	0	NO!	[]
Cartman	26	0	Listen, you're my friends, but if you've been compromised, I'll have no problem taking you out! I'll expect the same from you.	[]
Man 1	8	0	What is your problem? Get lost, little Eichmann.	[]
Woman 2	3	0	Oh my God!	[]
Man 2	6	1	What the hell are you doing?!	['hell']
Cartman	7	0	Everybody get in a single-file line!	[]
Officer Barbrady	3	0	There you are!	[]
Cartman	25	0	Ah, Officer Barbrady, you're just in time. These college know-it-all hippies were setting up for a music festival, just as I predicted.	[]
Officer Barbrady	6	0	Eric Cartman, you are under arrest.	[]
Cartman	1	0	What?	[]
Officer Barbrady	18	0	I was just over at your house and freed sixty-three people you had locked in your basement.	[]
Cartman	10	0	You let them out?! Jesus, we have to find them!	[]
Officer Barbrady	6	0	Oh no, you're coming downtown!	[]
Cartman	16	0	No! No, we have to stop them! You know how we-?! We gotta stop them! Hebbiaaay!	[]
Driver	3	0	Who was that?	[]
Cartman	4	0	What did I do?!	[]
Officer Barbrady	11	0	You can't kidnap people and lock them in your basement.	[]
Cartman	7	0	They're not people, they're HIPPIES!	[]
Mayor McDaniels.	5	0	Is this problem under control?	[]
Officer Barbrady	6	0	I handled it, Mayor. Gee whiz.	[]
Cartman	17	0	Mayor! Mayor, I confirmed the data! The hippies are going to have a massive jam band concert!	[]
Mayor McDaniels	6	0	I know. I signed the permit.	[]
Cartman	3	0	You... You what?	[]
Mayor McDaniels	21	0	I signed a permit allowing them to have their concert here. Their little festival should pump some money into our economy.	[]
Cartman	16	0	They're hippies! They don't HAVE any money! Does the city council know about this?!	[]
Mayor McDaniels	13	0	They don't have to know. I can sign whatever permit I want!	[]
Cartman	6	0	You just SOLD OUT OUR TOWN!	[]
Mayor McDaniels	7	0	That kid really needs some psychiatric help.	[]
Officer Barbrady	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Mayor McDaniels	5	0	All right, let's go.	[]
Cartman	18	1	How much money is enough, Mayor?! How many people's lives it is all worth?! God damned hippy!	['damned']
Announcer	8	0	This is a South Park News special report!	[]
Anchorman	29	0	Thousands of people have descended on South Park for a hippie music jam festival. The event is said to be the largest such gathering in the history of man.	[]
MC	25	0	All right, welcome to Hippie Jam Fest 2005!  Sooo great to see sooo many people turn out to make an impact on on the world!	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Kyle	3	0	You said it!	[]
MC	37	0	For too long, the corporations have bled the world of its love and resources! It is time for us to get to work and make the world a better place! And we're gonna start right now.	[]
Man 1	22	0	Oh man, I can't wait to see the look on those little Eichmann's faces when they hear this crunchy groove.	[]
Randy	6	0	Sharon, have, have you seen Stan?	[]
Sharon	9	0	He went with his friends to that music festival.	[]
Randy	8	0	Oh, Jesus, what has gotten into that kid?!	[]
Sharon	22	0	Now, Randy, we were the same way once, too. Don't forget that we were both considered hippies back in the '60s.	[]
Randy	21	0	Yeah, but when we did it we actually stood for something. I mean, remember Woodstock, Sharon? We actually did something there.	[]
Sharon	6	0	You ate too much acid, man!	[]
Sharon	9	0	...Oh my God. Our son is with those people.	[]
Randy	3	0	S-stan. STAAAN!	[]
Announcer	5	0	This is South Park News!	[]
Anchorman	26	0	Fear and horror in South Park today as the music festival continues to grow.  They're arriving in droves and apparently no end is in sight.	[]
Reporter	35	0	Tom, the crowd just keeps getting bigger and the town is literally bursting at the seams. We don't know where this music festival came from, but, it's very close to consuming us all.	[]
Linda	5	0	Steven, what do we do?	[]
Randy	8	0	Stan?! Stan?! I need to get through, please!	[]
Jimbo	24	0	Randy! Randy, you've got to get out of here! If they just trample this park, we'll be trapped! It's too dangerous!	[]
Randy	10	0	My son is in there! Duh-uh!  Stan?!  Stan! Stan!	[]
Male hippie	7	0	Hey, chill man. It's all good.	[]
Female hippie	6	0	Have some water laced with acid.	[]
Randy	3	0	Sta-ogh. Ugh!	[]
Mayor McDaniels	4	0	What have I done?	[]
MC	11	0	Yeah, South Park is now the hippie capital of the world!	[]
Mr. Mackey	9	0	Uh huh hi Eric, uh, how's it goin'?	[]
Cartman	12	1	Great, I love crapping in a toilet with no rim on it.	['crapping']
Randy	16	0	Eric, you were right. About the hippies. Could you... get rid of them for us now?	[]
Cartman	12	0	Let me guess: they've started a hippie jam band music festival.	[]
Sheila	14	0	We we need to take care of them, Eric! They're out of control!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Forget it.	[]
Randy	15	0	Please. Some of our kids are in there. We should have listened to you earlier.	[]
Chef	3	0	Yeah. We apologize.	[]
Jimbo	8	0	Please. Don't let them ruin our town.	[]
Cartman	18	0	It's too late! Even if I did agree to help, there's too many of them now!	[]
Mr. Mackey	21	0	We know you can do it, Eric. You're smart. Wha- why you're the smartest kid in school, m'kay?	[]
Randy	19	0	We're just asking you to try. The whole town even got together and, and baked you a cake.	[]
Cartman	22	0	Don't think that you can buy me with presents! ...Unless of course it's the new Tonka radio-controlled play bulldozer.	[]
Randy	3	0	It's yours.	[]
Cartman	19	0	I want the batteries for it too. And I get to drive it around in the school parking lot.	[]
Principal Victoria	1	0	Fine.	[]
Jimbo	2	0	Anything else?	[]
Cartman	26	0	Yes.  Kyle doesn't get to have one! Ever! And he has to watch me drive mine around the school parking lot and get super-jealous!	[]
Sheila	31	0	Well, we can promise not to buy one for Kyle, but we we can't make him watch you play th-  Oh yes! Fine! We'll force Kyle to watch you.	[]
Cartman	88	0	All right, fine. But now listen up and listen good! I've never tried to get rid of this many hippies before, so I'm gonna need every resource this town has! And even if I don't succeed, and it's a million-to-one shot that I will, I still get the Tonka radio-controlled bulldozer and get to play with it in the school parking lot where Kyle has to watch me and get super-jealous because he doesn't have one! Are we clear?!	[]
Driver	11	1	Wow, this band is so crunchy. Dude, I need more weed.	['weed']
Stan	17	0	So it seems like we have enough people now. When do we start taking down the corporations?	[]
Man 1	13	0	Yeah man, the corporations. Right now they're raping the world for money!	[]
Kyle	10	0	Yeah, so, where are they. Let's go get 'em.	[]
Man 2	26	0	Right now we're proving we don't need corporations. We don't need money. This can become a commune where everyone just helps each other.	[]
Man 1	26	0	Yeah, we'll have one guy who like, who like, makes bread. A-and one guy who like, l-looks out for other people's safety.	[]
Stan	8	0	You mean like a baker and a cop?	[]
Man 2	24	0	No no, can't you imagine a place where people live together and like, provide services for each other in exchange for their services?	[]
Kyle	6	0	Yeah, it's called a town.	[]
Driver	20	0	You kids just haven't been to college yet. But just you wait, this thing is about to get HUGE.	[]
Cartman	22	0	All right, everyone listen up! The hippie jam band festival is now fourteen miles in diameter and five hundred thousand hippies thick.	[]
Randy	2	0	My God...	[]
Cartman	66	0	In less than three days, all of South Park will be completely consumed. My only hope is to fight our way to the center of the crowd, and reach the heart, here.  If we can reach the stage, we can upload this Slayer CD into their music system.  Hippies can't stand death metal. If everything works, they should disperse just before they consume us all.	[]
Jimbo	28	1	Nice plan, kid, except there's one giant flaw. That hippie crowd is massive! How the hell are we supposed to get through it and reach the stage?	['hell']
Cartman	33	1	We drill.  I've designed a vehicle that can bore its way through even the densest hippie crowd. They pilots inside will be safe from the pot smoke and the crappy music outside.	['crappy']
Steven	18	0	Yuh... actually suggesting that somebody drives right into the heart of that mob? It's a suicide mission!	[]
Cartman	38	0	Not just somebody. I need a complete team to operate this vehicle. Along with me I'm gonna need a scientist, an engineer, and of course, a black person who can sacrifice himself in case something goes wrong.	[]
Randy	7	0	I'm the... only scientist in town.	[]
Linda	4	0	I'm your engineer.	[]
Steven	2	0	Honey, no!	[]
Linda	6	0	I have to do it, Steven.	[]
Cartman	35	0	All right, then we just need a black person who can sacrifice himself in case something goes wrong.  Lessee, anyone would do, anyone who meets the qualifications, let's see...  Oh, I know. How about-	[]
Chef	6	0	Yeah, yeah! I get it! Fine!	[]
Steven	16	0	I I can't believe we're actually listening to this. This is a crazy plan!	[]
Randy	12	1	You got a better ides, Steven?! Dammit, my son is in there!	['dammit']
Cartman	36	0	There's no more time for ideas! We have to have this vehicle up and operational in less than three days! Look, it's a long shot! But it's also the only shot we-  got.	[]
Reporter	41	0	Tom, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado, where a desperate attempt to save the town is underway. Some call it a suicide mission, but the heroic men and women of the hippie digger may be our only hope of survival.	[]
Ramdu	7	0	Well I... guess this is it, Sharon.	[]
Sharon	5	0	Please, save our boy, Randy.	[]
Linda	15	0	Butters, if anything happens to Mommy, I, I want you to be a good boy.	[]
Butters	4	0	Ah I will, Mom.	[]
Chef	11	0	Now, now, don't cry, ladies. Everything's gonna be fine.	[]
Cartman	22	0	I... don't want you to worry about me, Clyde Frog.  Hey! You're the best stuffed animal I've ever had.	[]
Sheila	4	0	Look out for yourselves!	[]
Mrs. Garrison	1	0	Godspeed!	[]
Cartman	3	0	Primary engine running?	[]
Randy	1	0	Check.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Navigation systems?	[]
Linda	1	0	Online	[]
Cartman	23	0	Let's punch this baby.  We're coming up on the outer perimeter of the hippies. Hang on.  Reaching hippie crowd. Hull status?	[]
Randy	3	0	Vehicle shell holding!	[]
Jimbo	3	0	They're in!	[]
Townsfolk	8	0	All right! All right, yeah! We did it!	[]
Mayor McDaniels	15	0	All right, people, let's save it!  They still have a long way to go!	[]
Stan	13	0	Alright, I can't take it anymore! I'm getting on that stage!	[]
Kyle	4	0	You're doing what?	[]
Guard	9	0	Hey, you can't go up there. Hoohoo, woo!	[]
Cartman	8	0	Switching to secondary fuel line.  What's that?	[]
Randy	10	0	The drill is getting too hot from all the hippies.	[]
Mayor McDaniels	3	0	What's happened?	[]
Mr. Mackey	8	0	They, they s- they stopped. Something's wrong.	[]
Steven	7	0	Jesus... they're dead in the water.  '	[]
Stan	29	0	Uh, excuse me. Excuse me, can I have your attention please? What are we doing?  It's been nine days! Doesn't it seem like we should accomplish something?	[]
A hippie	14	0	We're using the power of rock and roll to change the world! Woo!	[]
Stan	33	0	Maybe instead of complaining about corporations being selfish, we should look at ourselves. I mean, is there anything more selfish than doing nothing but getting high and listening to music all day long?	[]
Singer	22	0	He's right. It's time for all of us to focus our energy and get this hippie jam into full swing.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Come on, come on!	[]
Linda	11	0	It's useless. The main power line has been shut down.	[]
Randy	12	0	Somebody's gonna have to go outside and activate the backup boosters.	[]
Cartman	11	0	No, Chef, I'm not gonna let you go out there!	[]
Chef	4	0	...I didn't volunteer!	[]
Cartman	5	0	...All right, fine Chef, go!	[]
Chef	2	1	...Aw dammit!	['dammit']
Mayor McDaniels	12	0	That's it. We're going to Plan B. Nuke the crowd!	[]
Steven	11	1	God dammit no! Y-you have to give them more time!	['dammit']
Stan	16	0	Dude, these people have no idea what's going on. Let's get out of here.	[]
Kyle	18	0	We can't. Kenny just checked. There's a wall of people like seven miles thick behind us.	[]
Stan	11	1	What? You mean, we're stuck here listening to this crap?	['crap']
Man 2	7	0	Hey, what happened to the tunes, man?	[]
Man 1	4	0	More tunes. More tunes!	[]
Linda	6	0	We made it, We made it!	[]
Cartman	11	0	Hit the PA system NOW!  Put me in the main line!	[]
Randy	4	0	Which cord is it?	[]
Cartman	5	1	You're the scientist, jackass!	['jackass']
Randy	4	0	I'm a geologist!	[]
Linda	12	0	We don't have time to argue! They're gonna nuke us!	[]
Randy	1	0	Nyugh!	[]
Cartman	5	0	Put them in my laptop!	[]
A hippie	4	0	Oh man, not cool.	[]
Hippie 3	5	0	This music is so angry.	[]
Man 2	5	0	This is killing my buzz.	[]
Man 1	8	0	Let's bail on this whole angry scene.	[]
Randy	3	0	It's working!	[]
Linda	1	0	What?	[]
Randy	5	0	It's, it's working!	[]
Mrs. Garrison	6	0	We did it! We did it!	[]
Stan	1	0	Dad!	[]
Randy	1	0	Stan!	[]
Chef	3	0	I'm alive!	[]
Cartman	5	0	Hold it right there, Kyle!	[]
Kyle	17	0	Whoa, Cartman. We aren't gonna be hippies anymore. Y-you don't have to kill us.	[]
Cartman	12	0	Kill you? Oh no. I have much bigger plans for you now.	[]
Cartman	31	0	Hoho! Aw man, this is awesome! Weeeee!  Oh here, Kyle, you wanna play with it a little while.  Oh, psych! You don't get to! Hehe. Oh, check it out! Cooool!	[]
