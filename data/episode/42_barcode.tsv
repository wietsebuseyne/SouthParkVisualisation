Woman	79	0	Hello, everyone. I am Sister Hollis. I was chosen for my mission work to come here to Africa and teach you all about the teachings of Jesus.  Okay then, do we have our Bibles that were handed out freely?  No no, we don't eat the Bibles, we read them.  Now, let's turn to Mark 3:19.  Come on, remember : reading Bible plus accepting Jesus equals food.  Good. Now, who can read Mark 3:19? How about... Marvin?	[]

Kyle	2	0	Relax, fatass.	[]
Cartman	32	1	No. Dude, I've seen this on TV. They shine that light in your face, and then they try to get you to tell them stuff by squeezing your balls really hard.	['balls']
Stan	1	0	What??	[]
Cartman	29	1	Dude, I've seen it! They grab your balls with their leather-gloved hands and they squeeze 'em as hard as they can until they pop like little grapes!	['balls']

Cartman	8	0	Kyle's makin' mudpies; you guys want one?	[]
Connelly	14	0	This is getting us nowhere. We'll have to resort to more drastic measures.	[]
Sphinx	10	0	But they're just kids. We can't torture them.	[]
Connelly	38	0	Look, we don't know what that craft is capable of, but the kid is going to have to land it somewhere. God only knows what sadistic backwards Third-World country could get their hands on that ship!	[]

Receptionist	7	0	Gentlemen, Ms. Struthers can see you now.	[]
Connelly	21	0	I'm warning you, Bill. Sally Struthers is a bit heavy. But don't say anything, because she's pretty sensitive.	[]
Sphinx	32	0	Oh, I would never say anything. I saw some show where they made fun of Sally Struthers' weight, and I thought it was totally cruel. I mean, she helps people, you know.	[]

Stan	1	0	Cool!	[]
Cartman	7	0	Ey! I'm the leader of Earth!	[]
Stan	7	0	Screw you, Cartman! I called leader first!	[]
Cartman	16	1	Well, you can call leader 'til your ass bleeds, but that doesn't make it true!	['ass']
Marklar Leader	13	0	We are very thankful to you for bringing our marklar back to us.	[]
Kyle	8	0	Wait. I thought you called your planet Marklar.	[]
Marklar Leader	14	0	Oh, here on Marklar, we refer to all people, places, and things as marklar.	[]
Kyle	26	1	Well, our friend Marvin and all his people have to live on a part of Earth that sucks ass. They can't grow food or nothin'.	['ass']
Stan	19	0	Yeah, so it would be really cool if you would let Marvin and all his people come live here.	[]
Marklar Leader	38	0	Well, there is a lot of room on Marklar. If Marklar here wants to bring his marklar to Marklar, that would be fine. Just take our marklar back to Marklar and bring all the marklar back with you.	[]
Stan	2	0	Uuh. Thanks.	[]
Connelly	28	0	Let's go through this one more time, Mr. and Mrs. Clickclickderk! Your son Marvin has the ship that we want! How can we get it from him?	[]
Sphinx	49	0	We are the CIA. That ship needs to be with us! Maybe we should just take something precious of yours, huh?!  Daha!  This! This gourd-thingy, for instance. How do you like that, huh? If you ever wanna see this... little... thingy again, I suggest you contact your boy!	[]
Sphinx	3	0	There it is!	[]
Marvin	3	0	Muwuhbuh * * mlamleblubluh mjek.	[]
Connelly	7	0	Back away from the space craft, children!	[]
Stan	18	0	Nno. No, it's okay. The ship took us to another planet. A beautiful, lush place called Marklar.	[]
Kyle	14	0	Yeah. And the leader, he said that all the Ethiopians can go live there.	[]
Hollis	9	0	Alien race? Have they... heard the word of Christ?	[]
Cartman	5	0	No, never. It's perfect.	[]
Hollis	12	0	Ooh, no. Those poor souls. We must spread the Gospel to them.	[]

Pat	93	0	You know, Susan, the uh-there are so many great missionaries doing work, out there in in in-in parts of Africa, and uh we're trying to get Bibles to people all over the world. And what we need, is the help of everyone out there so that we can continue these, these projects. Now, listen to this, Susan.  Wha-one of our missionaries in North Africa has made an amazing discovery. U-u-uh a new planet, in the in the galaxy Alpha Seti VI, that has intelligent life on it.	[]
Susan	1	0	Amazing.	[]
Pat	25	0	Yeah. We're not sure what these hyper-intelligent beings look like, but one thing is for sure: they've never heard of Jesus Christ.	[]
Susan	13	0	What can we do at the 600 Club to help those poor aliens?	[]
Pat	46	0	Well, what we need, Susan, is we need money to build an interstellar cruiser.  Now, this space ship will be able to travel through a wormhole and deliver the message and guh-glory of Jesus Christ to those godless aliens. S-send your money now. Amen.	[]
Connelly	17	0	I want everyone to keep a safe distance from the craft until we can run some tests.	[]
FBI Agent	12	0	E-excuse me, gentlemen, uh Tom Brokaw is here to see you.	[]
Sphinx	7	0	Tom Brokaw? Oh no, the press already?	[]
Sphinx	6	0	Uh huh.  Mr. Brokaw, I presume.	[]

Pat	59	0	Everyone, the Word of God is going around the world and all your help is so greatly appreciated. Eh-oo What we need now is an argon crystal laser.  Eh you see, an argon crystal laser can pierce thick space holes in a way that other lasers just can't. Send your money now. Uuh-I th-thank you.	[]

Hollis	6	1	Holy crap, they have photon torpedoes.	['crap']
Pat	54	0	Uhnow, our deflector shields are useless against phorton torpedoes, and we really need your support on this one, folks. Here at the 600 Club we need your money to spread the Word of Jesus, and build more advanced deflector shields for our galactic cruiser. Call now, and we'll give you this free pin.	[]
Stan	4	0	You got 'em, Marvin.	[]

Kyle	4	0	Sorry, Marvin. We tried.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Wait. Ms. Struthers? Ms. Struthers!	[]
Sally	1	0	Wo?	[]
Cartman	47	0	Ms. Struthers, please. Just listen to me for one second. You started the Feed the Children Foundation for wonderful reasons: to help starving, helpless people who live in a rotten part of the world. Well, it's for those reasons we wanna help our friend Marvin now.	[]
Sally	2	0	Holna chewbacca?	[]
Sphinx	14	0	Ms. Struthers, don't forget the gift we gave you: the child in carbonite.	[]
Sally	5	0	Dama doko nou na oh.	[]

Sally	2	0	Oh, foada!	[]
Cartman	3	0	She bought it.	[]
Stan	5	0	Sally Struthers is saving us!	[]
Pat	85	1	Uh, now, now, stay with me on this one, folks. Uh, Sally Struthers has a Tiberian junker , which is uh the favorite ship of the Hutts, and she has trapped oureh, our our new CBC ship in an uh  poe-sitronic tractor beam.  Uh, so we're gonna need an ionic tractor disruptor. Now now, not a regular ionic di- tractor disruptor, but a negative ionic tractor disruptor to uh, help spread the Word of Jesus.  I don't have a fucking idea up here.	['fucking']
Stan	4	0	Now's our chance!	[]
Cartman	8	0	Wait. I remember. It was the red button!	[]

Marklar	2	0	Who? Marklar?	[]
Stan	14	0	We brought Marvin and his people to live here, but these buttholes followed us.	[]
Marklar	3	0	Brought m- marklar??	[]
Hollis	3	0	What is marklar?	[]
Marklar	11	0	Yyou're marklar; everyone and everything is referred to as marklar.	[]
Sphinx	5	0	Doesn't that get confusing?	[]
Marklar	6	0	Oh no. Watch this. Hey, Marklar!	[]
Marklar	1	0	Yes?	[]
Marklar	2	0	You see?	[]
Kyle	109	0	Wait. Wait. I think I can explain this whole thing. Marklar, these marklars want to change your marklar. They don't want Marklar or any of these marklars to live here because it's bad for their marklar. They use Marklar to try and force marklars to believe they're marklar. If you let them stay here, they will build marklars and marklars. They will take all your marklars and replace them with Marklar. These marklar have no good marklar to live on Marklar, so they must come here to Marklar. Please, let these marklars stay where they can grow and prosper without any marklars, marklars, eh or marklars.	[]
