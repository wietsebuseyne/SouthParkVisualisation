Cartman	28	0	Oh, yes, hello. I am helping out a family who has a missing child, and I was wondering if you could print his photo on your milk carton?	[]
Receptionist	19	0	Oh, of course. Printing those photos on our milk really does help. Do you have the photo with you?	[]
Cartman	6	0	Yes, I have it right hmya.	[]
Receptionist	8	0	O-okay, great. We'll print it immediately.	[]
Cartman	10	0	You will?  Ah.  Oh, ah, thank you for your help.	[]

Reporter	24	0	Ms. Hamilton was the fourth person to be run over by a motorcycle this week, leaving a city to ponder, who will be next?	[]
Kyle	1	0	Hello?	[]

Kyle	1	0	Hello?	[]
Cartman	2	0	...You guys!...	[]
Kyle	1	0	Cartman?	[]
Cartman	7	0	You guys! You guys! You guys! Hurry.	[]
Stan	4	0	What's he want?	[]
Kyle	8	0	I don't know. Let's go see.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Why'd you call us?	[]
Cartman	18	0	Come on. Come on.  Come on. Oho, this is so sweet!  You guys, seriously, this is sooo sweet!	[]
Stan	3	1	Goddamnit Cartman, what?!	['goddamnit']
Kyle	9	0	...You put Kenny's picture on a milk carton??	[]
Cartman	8	0	Look at, look at the description. Brown eye!	[]
Stan	5	0	That isn't funny, Cartman.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Oh, it's soo completely funny!! Ahaha this is certainly funny!!	[]
Kyle	17	0	No it's not, Cartman. You know, there really are couples out there who are missing children.	[]
Cartman	9	0	No there aren't. Jesus, grow up, you guys.	[]
Martha	10	0	Oh my God. Oh my God!  Steven! Steven, come quick!	[]
Steven	4	0	What is it, Martha?	[]
Martha	8	0	Look. It's him! It's... our son.	[]
Steven	2	0	Our ssson!	[]
Martha	25	0	...and so that's when I called out to my husband. I just knew the boy picture on your milk carton was our little Tommy.	[]
Receptionist	16	0	... yes, I see.  Uh, but the child on the milk carton was reported missing, not found.	[]
Steven	39	0	We realize that. But we just thought that maybe someone else had found Tommy, and then lost him again. We're pretty certain that it's our boy, considering his physical appearance. Martha and I have the... same condition.	[]
Receptionist	1	0	...Riiight.	[]
Steven	16	1	You may not have realized this, but we actually have buttocks where our heads should be.	['buttocks']
Receptionist	1	0	...Really?	[]
Steven	1	0	Yes.	[]
Martha	20	0	Steven and I have a condition called torsonic polarity syndrome. It's a birth defect that's passed on genetically.	[]
Steven	7	0	Over eleven people worldwide suffer from TPS.	[]
Receptionist	8	0	Hmm, hmm, that's am-, that's amazing.	[]
Steven	16	0	Martha and I were lucky enough to meet each other at a TPS convention in France.	[]
Receptionist	12	0	So... do you have heads down where your rear ends should be?	[]
Steven	32	0	No no, don't be silly. You see, with TPS, the birth defect is on the exterior only. Behind this we still have all our vital head organs - tongue, eyes, nasal passages...	[]
Receptionist	4	0	Well, Mr. and Mrs...	[]
Steven	2	0	Uh, Thompssson.	[]
Receptionist	21	0	...Thompson. Uh, I'll contact the young boy who gave me the photo, and perhaps we can all visit him together.	[]
Martha	10	0	Oh, wonderful! Steven, we're goin' to see Tommy again!	[]
Steven	11	0	Now, Martha, what did I say about getting our hopesss up?	[]
Martha	6	0	You're right. You're right.	[]
Kyle	8	0	...Okay Cartman, what do you want this time?	[]
Cartman	48	0	Oho, you guys, you guys! Oh my God.  Okay, okay, so get this, get this: The milk company calls me, right?  And they call me and say that two people from Wisconsin... saw the picture of Kenny on the milk carton, and they think it's their kid.	[]
Stan	11	0	...Dude, that's not funny if they're missing their son.	[]
Cartman	20	1	No, nonono! Because apparently these two people... also kind of look like they have butts where their heads should be!	['butts']
Kyle	2	0	...Nuh uh.	[]
Cartman	55	0	Oh yes! And the best part is... they're coming here, to my house. And it's gonna be sooo funny!!  Oh Jesus, that's probably them now! Okay, you guys, just play it cool, just play it-, just-sshh. No, sshh, you guys, sshh.  Just- okay  No.  Okay, okay, no, you guys, sh, sh.	[]
Martha	7	0	Hello, we're Mr. and Mrs. Thompson.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Oh God.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Hohly crahap, duhude, heh!	[]
Stan	2	0	No way!	[]
Steven	7	0	We understand you've seen our son.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Oh my... God.	[]
Stan	5	0	Cartman, where are you going??	[]
Martha	10	0	Uh, excuse me, boys, do you know anything about this?	[]
Kyle	1	0	Uh	[]
Stan	2	0	Oh boy.	[]
Kyle	18	0	Eh-heh. L-look, if you want an explanation, you you'd better go to Kenny's house.	[]
Stan	13	0	Yeah. He lives about four houses away in the bad side of town.	[]
Martha	5	0	Oh thank you. Thank you!	[]
Receptionist	1	0	Well?	[]
Steven	7	0	They said to inquire four houses down.	[]
Martha	3	0	Let's hurry!	[]
Kyle	8	1	Ehheh, Cartman, what the hell are you doing?	['hell']
Stan	6	0	Yeah, you missed them turning around.	[]
Cartman	5	0	You guys, something's wrong.	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Cartman	20	0	I think... I.. just.. saw the funniest thing I'll ever see. And I... think... I... blew a funny fuse.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Blew a funny fuse?	[]
Cartman	27	0	It was just too much and my sense of humor overloaded.  I don't think anything will ever be funny again. Oh God. What have I got?	[]
Clyde	9	1	You mean they both have butts instead of heads?	['butts']
Stan	12	0	Yeah, dude, we'll show you. They're over at Kenny's.	[]
Token	4	0	How do they eat?	[]
Stan	6	1	How the hell should we know?	['hell']
Kyle	9	0	Butters! Hey Butters! You have to check this out!	[]
Butters	2	0	W-what?	[]
Kyle	9	0	You gotta come to Kenny's house with us.	[]
Stan	12	1	There's these two people with asses where their heads should be.	['asses']
Butters	16	0	Ahah-I can't, fellas. Ah-I'm grounded for lookin' stupid in my school picture.	[]
Stan	9	0	But dude, you gotta see it; it's hysterical!	[]
Linda	28	1	Butters can't come out and play, boys. He thinks it's funny to look like a jackass in his school pictures that I have to pay for!	['jackass']
Butters	20	1	Huh, but I told you mom: ah-I didn't mean to look... like a jackass, eh. It just happened.	['jackass']
Linda	5	0	You made a goofy face!	[]
Butters	9	0	No! That's just what I look like. See?	[]
Linda	10	0	...Don't you make that face at me, young man!	[]
Butters	7	0	I'm not makin' a face, mom!	[]
Linda	2	0	Stop it!	[]
Craig	8	1	...Come on, we wanna see the ass people.	['ass']
Kyle	1	0	Alright.	[]
Linda	24	0	Fine Butters! If you don't wanna stop making that stupid face at me, you can just stay in your room for another week!	[]
Butters	7	0	Another week?  I hate my stupid face.	[]
Mr. Mackey	17	0	Okay Eric, as your counselor, uh I want you to feel comfortable talking about anything, m'kay?	[]
Cartman	20	0	Mr. Mackey, is it possible that you can see something so funny that it ruins your sense of humor forever?	[]
Mr. Mackey	12	0	Well, I can't think of anything that would be THAT funny.	[]
Cartman	17	1	Two people with asses for heads. Ever since I saw them I can't laugh at anything.	['asses']
Mr. Mackey	13	0	Oh, I see, well... Well, what did you used to think was funny?	[]
Cartman	47	0	You know, all the usual stuff. Dirty jokes, funny movies, seeing someone die...  This morning, I even saw a little girl get her fingers caught in a car door and... I couldn't laugh. I mean I... I knew it was funny, but I couldn't laugh.	[]
Mr. Mackey	37	0	Well Eric, I suppose that, just like everything else, laughter can be relative - in, in other words, sometimes people see somethin' so scary that nothin' else scares them, so, the same could be true for funny things.	[]
Cartman	9	0	So does that mean I'll never laugh again?	[]
Mr. Mackey	29	0	It's possible, hm'kay?  But you know, if you have completely lost your sense of humor, you can always become a writer for the show, Friends . Ohokahay, huhuh.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Ugh.	[]
Mrs. McCormick	21	1	...and so you see, our son was just playing a joke and the little fat kid put it on the carton.	['fat']
Martha	4	0	Yes. Yes, I see.	[]
Mrs. McCormick	11	0	Kenny, don't you think you owe the Thompsons an apology?	[]
Martha	11	0	...No, it was foolish for us to get our hopes up.	[]
Steven	26	1	It was just such a coincidence, considering the photo. You may not have realized this, but Martha and I have buttocks where our heads should be.	['buttocks']
Stuart and Mrs. McCormick	1	0	Really?	[]
Receptionist	15	0	Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, how long has it been since you've seen your son?	[]
Steven	7	0	Tommy disappeared when he was only seven.	[]
Martha	12	0	Oh, Steven, it's like it's all happening all over again.	[]
Mrs. McCormick	3	0	There there now.	[]
Receptionist	36	0	Please, Mrs. Thompson, it'll be alright.  Listen, the South Park Dairy Company is the country's largest. We find lost children all the time.  We can help you find Tommy with the company's database!	[]
Mrs. McCormick	21	0	Yes, well, aaah-I'll help you find your son. Just stop cryin', Please, for the love of God, stop cryin'!	[]
Martha	8	0	Ah, agh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.	[]
Receptionist	11	0	Mr. Thompson, how did your son become missing? Was he abducted?	[]
Steven	12	0	Yes. He was in the care of our nanny at the time.	[]
Martha	28	0	The nanny that we trusted so much took off with him and we still don't know why.  We think perhaps she wanted a child of her own.	[]
Receptionist	6	0	And this was back in Wisconsin?	[]
Steven	18	0	Yes, but we last heard the nanny was heading west.  That's why we thought Colorado made sssssense.	[]
Martha	16	0	We've tried every avenue to find him,  but, we've never tried the milk company.	[]
Receptionist	40	0	Well you just give us a try. I think you'll find that South Park Milk  is not only the best resource for finding kids,  but also the best producer of the freshest 2% lowfat milk the world can offer.	[]
Martha	9	0	Thank you. Thank you so much for helping us.	[]
Steven	12	0	This certainly is a friendly town.  You've all been sssssso wonderful.	[]
Martha	10	0	Yes, I'm so grateful I just wanna cry again.	[]
"Stuart and wife, and Receptionist"	1	0	NO!	[]
Male 1	8	0	Dude, why are you wearing Shalayna's panties?	[]
Male 2	21	0	I have to wear Shalayna's panties. Lisa's were in the wash.  Look, can we just get this over with?	[]
Male 1	12	0	But dude, I can't French-kiss him. He's my grandpa!	[]
Male 2	3	0	Come on, dude.	[]
Male 1	8	0	Oh, alright  Here it goes. Come'ere, Grandpa.	[]
Audience	1	0	Aww	[]
Cartman	3	0	Oh, dude, oh.	[]
Jonesy	6	0	Dude, what's wrong with you?	[]
Cartman	6	0	Nothing's wrong with me. Uh-	[]
Male 1	23	0	Well, I'm glad that's over with. We'd better go back to the house now to see how Chris is doing.	[]
President	27	0	Uh Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, as President of the South Park Milk Company, I want to apologize personally for printing that falsified picture on our milk cartons.	[]
Steven	7	0	Please, please. It's not your fault.	[]
President	68	1	Ye-yes, but here at South Park Milk we strive for excellence. For instance, we are now entering the extraction room.  As you can see, we keep it close to the refrigeration room. That way we can get the milk to the container as fast as possible.  That's why some say South Park milk tastes like you're suckin' it right from the cow's tits yourself.	['tits']
Martha	1	0	Amazing.	[]
President	13	0	Here, try a glass of our cold Vitamin D. And our fresh scones.	[]
Steven	1	0	Delicious.	[]
Martha	11	0	Oh, excuse me. A little... difficult to drink with our condition.	[]
Steven	11	1	Martha and I actually have buttocks where our heads should be.	['buttocks']
President	12	0	Really? Well. And in here we have our Missing Child Resource Center.	[]
Martha	6	0	Oh my, isn't this impressive?	[]
President	18	0	Yes. With the Kelrom 4000, Mrs. Garthunk can search a database of over 30 million missing child cases.	[]
Mrs. Garthunk	17	0	We'll start the computer on a data search. Now, when did your son turn up missing?	[]
Steven	11	0	Well, it was 1982. Tommy was only six at the time.	[]
Mrs. Garthunk	3	0	Alright then. Computer...	[]
Computer	1	0	Workiiing.	[]
Mrs. Garthunk	15	0	Run a scan of missing children since 1982. Check for physical birth defects called TPS.	[]
Computer	9	0	TPS. Torsonic Polarity Syndrome. Child missing since 1982. Workiiing.	[]
President	12	0	So you actually haven't seen your son in over 20 years?	[]
Martha	3	0	That's right.	[]
Mrs. Garthunk	20	0	But then, why did you think the picture of Kenny was him. Wouldn't your son be much older now?	[]
Steven	22	0	Yes, but since he appeared to be at least eight in the photo,  we assumed someone had seen him since we did.	[]
Martha	11	0	This is the only photo we have of our little Tommy.	[]
Mrs. Garthunk	18	0	It's gonna take quite a while for the computer to do a scan of all missing kids.	[]
President	24	0	Well, why don't we let Mrs. Garthunk do her work, and I'll take you two out for some good old Colorado chili.	[]
Steven	11	0	We don't really like chili; it makes us throw up.	[]
Jimmy	12	0	Well, hello, Eric. I was really glad you called me, very much.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Jimmy! Thank God! Get in here!	[]
Jimmy	5	0	What's this all about?	[]
Cartman	21	0	Jimmy, you've always been my favorite standup comic. You've gotta help me. I've lost my sense of humor.	[]
Jimmy	16	0	Gee, that's a terrible thing, Eric. Um comedy can be the best therapy, very much.	[]
Cartman	15	0	I just have to find my funny bone again! Just try and make me laugh.	[]
Jimmy	17	0	Oh, I don't think that'll be hard. I've been working on my rr... routine.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Okay, let me have it.	[]
Jimmy	14	0	Okay. Try this one on for size: Why did the... pigeon cross the road?	[]
Cartman	2	0	Okay, why?	[]
Jimmy	42	4	Because it was having sex with the chihi... Because it was having sex with the ch-hi-hi... Because it was having sex with the ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch...  eh, it was having sex with the ch-ch-hiicken.	['sex', 'sex', 'sex', 'sex']
Cartman	9	0	...Naw, see? Somethng's wrong. I'm not laughing.	[]
Jimmy	11	0	Wow, what a great audience... How about this classic? Knock-knock.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Who's there?	[]

Mrs. Garthunk	16	0	Hah, let's see. The Dallas-Ft. Wroth area. I haven't tried there yet. Computer?	[]
Computer	1	0	Workiiing.	[]
Mrs. Garthunk	16	0	Scan for any children reported found in the Dallas-Ft. Wroth area, with a facial deformity.	[]
Computer	2	0	Workiiing.  Negative.	[]
Mrs. Garthunk	14	0	Ugh. This is hopeless! ...Wait a minute, let's try it this way: Computer?	[]
Computer	1	0	Workiiing.	[]
Mrs. Garthunk	9	0	Scan databanks for children who reported their parents missing.	[]
Computer	6	0	Workiiing.  One million six thousand hits.	[]
Mrs. Garthunk	12	0	Alright, then break it down to claims in the past twenty years.	[]
Computer	7	0	Workiiing.  Three hundred twenty-one thousand hits.	[]
Mrs. Garthunk	11	1	Alright, now run a scan on homogenized versus pasteurized skim milk.	['homogenized']
Computer	12	1	In skim form, homogenized has longer shelf life by 2.3 weeks.	['homogenized']
Mrs. Garthunk	24	0	Okaaay, okay, now give me a breakdown of people who are seeking their parents who also suffer from a disease called T P S.	[]
Computer	12	0	Torsonic Polarity Syndrome, plus, a claim to not know parents: one match	[]
Mrs. Garthunk	6	0	Bingo. Do you have a photo	[]
Computer	1	0	Printiiing.	[]
Mrs. Garthunk	5	0	My God. Oh my God!	[]

Butters	19	0	Aw gee, thah-at sounds swell, fellas, but I can't go 'cause I'm still havin' behavioral problems.	[]
Stan	10	0	Why are you wearing a paper bag on your head?	[]
Butters	31	0	Uh, my parents are makin' me wear this paper bag until I learn... to stop makin' silly faces all the time. They've really had it up to  here with me.	[]
Stephen	10	0	Butters? Are you ready to stop with the stupid faces?	[]
Butters	4	0	I sure am, Dad!	[]
Stephen	8	0	Alright, you can take the paper bag off.	[]
Butters	9	0	Thanks, Dad! Ah I'm sorry I was bad-	[]
Stephen	17	0	Oh, very funny, young man! You think it's clever to make yourself up like a girl?!	[]
Butters	8	0	Hububut Dad, ah I didn't lick a-	[]

Cartman	44	0	Dear Mom: I can no longer stand to be without a sense of humor. Without laughter, the world is a cold and sad place, and I can't go out to face it anymore. Please tell everyone why I won't be at school.	[]
Cartman	13	0	And please buy me more chocolate guns. I'm starting to run out.	[]
Cartman	17	0	Please get the kind with marshmallow inside. I don't like the peanut-butter filled one. Eric.	[]
President	31	0	And so it is with great pride that we have flown little Billy Thompson out here, to be reunited with his parents for the first time in twenty years.  Mrs. Garthunk?	[]
Mrs. Garthunk	81	0	Thank you, Mr. President. I'm proud to be an employee of South Park Milk,  which to date has found over a hundred thousand missing kids, and, led the way in the fight against curdling. Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, your son grew up not knowing who his parents were.  But he was strong and resilient,  and ended up becoming very successful. I think it will amaze you as it will all of us to learn that your son... is Ben Affleck!	[]
President	4	0	Come around here, Ben!	[]
Ben Affleck	2	0	Mom! Dad!	[]
Steven	1	0	Son!	[]
Martha	2	0	Oh, son!	[]
Cartman	4	0	What's goin' on?	[]
Stan	8	1	Dude, the ass-faces' son is Ben Affleck!	['ass']
Steven	5	0	Oh, our same ol' Ben!	[]
