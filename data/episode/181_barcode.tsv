Mr. Mackey	35	0	M'kay, so now the computer will show a command bar, m'kay, and we type in x = y + 1. Mkay, and then it says we hit Command-Y to bring up the menu screen.	[]
Cartman	14	1	Oh man, you've got to be kidding me. God damn Japs are everywhere.	['damn']
Mr. Mackey	15	0	M'kay, now right-click on menu item Equate O and type in input y.	[]
Kyle	9	0	Nah, dude. Are you on America's side, Stan?	[]
Stan	7	0	No, I'm on the Japanese side.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Oh, who just shot me?	[]
Mr. Mackey	46	1	M'kay, let's see, uh the right-click is the upper-right...  uhhh, but then what the hell is the...?  Okay kids, I'm gonna need to get some clarification on this. Uh, just keep entering the calculations; I'll be right back, m'kay.	['hell']
Cartman	15	0	U-hohhh dude, I wish I had a real flamethrower. It works awesome on Japs.	[]
Butters	13	0	Oh my God, Oh my God!  Stan! Stan, we have a big problem.	[]
Stan	2	0	Dude, what?	[]
Butters	6	0	There's vampires in the school!	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Butters	5	0	Vampires. I've seen them.	[]
Stan	9	0	Dude, aw! Who's using the flak jacket cheat?!	[]
Red	7	0	Not a cheat if you rank up.	[]
Butters	25	0	Ugh.  Kenny, there's a vampire on the loose. He and Katie Gelson was hanging out with him, and now she's a vampire too!	[]
Kyle	8	0	Butters, there's no such things as vampires.	[]
Butters	30	0	But there is. You guys gotta believe me. First there was just a couple, but now it's like they're growing. They have fangs and drink blood and everything.	[]
Cartman	17	0	All right Butters, will you go document the vampires' movements so we know what their intentions are.	[]
Butters	7	0	Really? Do you think that's best?	[]
Cartman	6	0	Yeah, now get out of here.	[]
Butters	16	0	All right!  If I don't make it back, tell my mom what happened to me.	[]
Cartman	9	1	Oh-hohhh, you got pwned, Bebe, you Jap bitch!	['bitch']
Lead Vampire	26	0	Isn't this cool? This time of day nobody's in the gym. We should make this one of our official South Park Vampires Club hangouts.	[]
Spiky Vampire	9	1	That's an awesome new coat, Mike. Totally badass.	['badass']
Vampir	10	0	Don't call me Mike, my name is Vampir now.	[]
Spiky Vampire	4	0	Oh, that's cool.	[]
Midnight Vampire	8	0	I'm gonna change my name to Vladimir.	[]
Vampir	9	0	You can't; it's too close to Vampir.	[]
Butters	17	0	12:32 p.m. Vampires meeting in the school gymnasium. Leader appears to be a fifth grader.	[]
Sparkly Vampire	25	0	You know that girl Bella in Twilight? I think I'm like her. I'm a psi vampire. Do you like the sparkles I got?	[]
Butters	6	0	Annie Bartlett is a psi vampire.	[]
Vampir	19	0	Yeah, I'm more a sanguinarian vampire in that I rely more on the life force energy, per se.	[]
Spiky Vampire	12	0	Hehyeah, I'm gonna be a hybrid vampire, both psi and sanguinarian.	[]
Butters	12	0	That's Ryan Ellis. Looks like they've gotten to him too.	[]
Bloodrayne	10	0	Lunchtime's almost over. Should we drink some more blood?	[]
Other Vampires	2	0	Yeah! Cool!	[]
Vampir	14	0	Yeah, and then I think it's time for us to feed, per se.	[]
Butters	21	0	Oh God I think they're gonna drink blood now. They've got some kind of chalice, and they're  uhn...	[]
Tape	37	0	Toot toododoo!  It's the Big Texas Butters show! And now here he is, Big Texas Butters! Why howdy there, partners. I'm Biiig Texas Butters. And this is my horse, Toast. Happy Trails, to youuu.  AAHHH.	[]
Vampir	5	0	Ummm, what are you doing?	[]
Butters	21	0	Get back! For real, stay back! Hwa! Heah! The body of Christ compels you! The body of Christ compels you!  Hwaaaahh!	[]
Bloodrayne	7	0	That kid was really scared of us.	[]
Vampir	21	0	That's true, Bloodrayne. People are going to be frightened of us because they don't understand our ways, per se.	[]
Spiky Vampire	5	0	Heeyeah, we're cool, huh?	[]
Pete	7	1	What the hell are those kids doing?	['hell']
Henrietta	11	0	Why are they all dressing like that all of a sudden?	[]
Pete	6	0	Are they trying to be Goth?	[]
Michael	13	0	No, they're vamp. They wear plastic fangs and drink freaking Clamato juice.	[]
Henrietta	11	0	But they can't dress like that. That's our style.	[]
Midnight Vampire	13	0	Hey, Tommy Petros is thinking he might wanna be a Vamp kid too.	[]
Vampir	5	0	Tommy Petros? Is he cool?	[]
Bloodrayne	5	0	Yeah, he's cool enough.	[]
Vampir	2	0	All right.	[]
Pete	18	0	So, all of a sudden you Justin and Britney wannabes think it's cool to dress like us?	[]
Vampir	13	0	We dress the way our souls feel, to express the darkness, per se.	[]
Michael	5	0	Aren't you Mike Makowski?	[]
Vampir	5	0	That's Vampir Makowski now.	[]
Henrietta	16	0	You kids need to all go put your freakin' Banana Republic clothes back on, right now!	[]
Sparkly Vampire	11	0	Hey, we're just as dark as you guys, maybe darker!	[]
Pete	6	0	Really. Do you guys even smoke?	[]
Vampir	8	0	Of course not. Smoking's bad for you.	[]
Other Vamps	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Pete	3	0	Oh my Gohhd.	[]
Vampir	22	0	You know, you guys are really giving off a negative human energy. We prefer to take our darkness somewhere else, per se.	[]
Pete	8	0	All right, Count Fagula, you just do that.	[]
Butters	13	0	Mom, Mom, I gotta tell you somethin'! You're not gonna believe it!	[]
Linda	19	0	Not now, Butters. Your father wants to have a talk with you in the kitchen. He is not happy.	[]
Butters	8	0	Oh no, what did I do this time?	[]
Linda	6	0	You just march on in there.	[]
Butters	2	0	Oh Jeez...	[]
Stephen	48	0	You see this, Butters?! It's a glass of milk I poured for myself! And you see this?!  It's Hamburger Helper! Now would you mind telling me what Hamburger Helper is doing in this glass of milk?!  Why is Hamburger Helper in a glass of milk, Butters?!	[]
Butters	5	0	I have no idea, sir.	[]
Stephen	26	0	I'll tell you why!  Our pantry is always kept organized alphabetically! But somebody put the Hamburger Helper where the Nestle Quik is supposed to go!	[]
Butters	28	0	Uh, well I'm sorry, Dad. I- it's just that I've been really preoccupied lately. You see, there are these kids at school and they want-	[]
Stephen	6	0	What keeps a family together, Butters?!	[]
Butters	4	0	A well-organized pantry.	[]
Stephen	29	0	That's right!  If you keep putting food under the wrong letter, it all goes wrong!  Now you will reorganize this entire pantry, and you will do it right!	[]
Butters	21	0	Well okay, but Dad, you've gotta listen to me. Kids at school are starting to change. They've been acting-	[]
Stephen	15	0	You do it right now or you're going to be grounded! You got that?!	[]
Butters	50	0	Yes sir.  Jeez. Nobody will even listen to me. It's like nobody even cares if there's vampires at the school. I try to help and all I ever do is get hollered at. I bet vampires never get hollered at. Vampires just get to do whatever they want.	[]
Vampir	19	1	...All mortals share a soft repose, My soul doth dreadful vigils keep, More keen than which hell scarcely knows.	['hell']
Sparkly Vampire	5	0	What is that kid doing?	[]
Butters	13	0	Oh Jesus, oh God, Butters, what are you doing?  I- I'm Butters.	[]
Vampir	1	0	So?	[]
Butters	26	0	O creatures of the night, I seek audience to engage with thee in unholy darnation and thus do... a-a-and thus do unto your bidding!	[]
Vampir	1	0	What?	[]
Butters	7	0	Oh, uh... I wanna be a vampire.	[]
Cowlick Vampire	10	0	You're not cool enough to be one of us.	[]
Butters	23	0	Yeah, I know, but uhhh, I think I would make a really good vampire if you just, well, just give me the opportunity.	[]
Vampir	18	0	We'll think about it. Go get us some sodas out of the pop machine in the commons.	[]
Butters	4	0	Yes! Yes, anything else?	[]
Midnight Vampire	4	0	I want some Cheetos.	[]
Butters	9	0	Soda and Cheetos, yes. I'll be right back.	[]
Singer	16	0	I'm not part of your society. I don't follow your fads and rules. Doctrines...	[]
Boy 1	10	0	Where did it go? Do you see where it went?	[]
Boy 2	10	0	Yeah, it's right over there by those vampire kids.	[]
Pete	12	0	What? Hey. Hey! We aren't vampire kids, we're freakin' Goths!	[]
Boy 1	12	0	Whatever, Dracula, why don't you turn into a bat or something?	[]
Michael	4	2	So lame. So... Lame...	['lame', 'lame']
Henrietta	14	1	You guys, I do not wanna be grouped in with douchey, little vampire kids.	['douchey']
Michael	2	1	Sooo lame!	['lame']
Little Vamp	13	0	See? Isn't it cool back here? It's all dark and isolated.	[]
Shades Vamp	10	0	This would be a great place for a Vampire meeting.	[]
Henrietta	8	0	Get out of our space, you little twerps!	[]
Pete	14	1	More preppy straight-A students turning into vampires. What the hell is going on?	['hell']
Butters	31	0	I've done what you've asked.  A case of Dr Pepper and Cherry Twizzlers. Who are you gonna give this to? I-I mean, vampires can't eat people food.	[]
Vampir	14	0	You have done well. Are you ready to become one of us, per se?	[]
Butters	3	0	Yeah, I guess.	[]
Vampir	17	0	Are you sure? Because once you're in South Park Vampire Society, you can't ever leave.	[]
Butters	16	0	Well I'm sick of bein'- pushed around. M-by my dad, by kids at school.	[]
Vampir	16	0	Then it is time for your transformation, per se. Let it begin!  This way. Prepare thyself.	[]
Butters	1	0	Whoa.	[]
Vampir	21	0	And now you shall drink vampire blood, and your transformation will be complete, per se!  With this thy transformation is done.	[]
Butters	6	0	Oh, that tastes awful! Blagh, blagh.	[]
Vampir	12	0	It is finished! Welcome, Butters, to the South Park Society of Vampires.	[]
Stephen	15	0	There you are, Butters! Do you know what time it is?! Where have you been?!	[]
Linda	8	0	Butters, what have you done to your hair?	[]
Stephen	10	0	Hey! Butters, we are talking to you! Explain yourself, mister!	[]
Butters	10	0	I no longer need to explain anything to you, Father!	[]
Linda	3	0	What on Earth?	[]
Stephen	12	0	That does it! You are grounded for two weeks, you got that?!	[]
Butters	20	0	You can't ground me! For I am neither living nor dead! How can thy ground that which is... ungroundable.	[]
Stephen	17	0	All right, I don't know what's gotten into you, mister, but you're gonna-  Ah!	[]
Linda	1	0	Butters?	[]
Butters	13	0	I am going to my room now! For I must slumber, per se.	[]
Principal Victoria	38	0	Now, kids, I understand that you are very into this vampire thing, but I don't want to see it get out of hand. You kids need to understand that your new little fad is scary to some.	[]
Pete	10	0	...Oh my God. You've got the wrong flippin' people.	[]
Michael	4	0	We aren't vampires.	[]
Principal Victoria	25	0	I know that you aren't really vampires, and I appreciate that you wanna be cool because vampires are the in thing right now, but-	[]
Pete	7	0	We aren't trying to be popular!	[]
Principal Victoria	14	0	-but just make sure that this new little trend doesn't become a distraction.	[]
Mr. Mackey	9	0	Here's a couple more, Principal Victoria, hm'kay.	[]
Vampir	7	0	Oh, oh no, are we in trouble?	[]
Principal Victoria	12	0	I was just telling your friends about what I expect of your-	[]
Michael	4	0	We aren't friends!	[]
Vampir	24	0	Don't worry, Ma'am. As I was just explaining to my new minions, vampires are actually very spiritual and deep beings, per se.	[]
Michael	14	0	Allison Merch is a vampire kid now? This thing isn't going to stop.	[]
Pete	35	1	Let's just face it: they bogarted our style! Everyone's gonna think we're trying to be butthole vampires now. We might as well go to the freakin' Gap and just buy normal clothes.	['butthole']
Pete	12	0	Well, at least nobody can refer to us as vampire kids now.	[]
Boy 1	4	0	It went this way?	[]
Boy 3	24	1	Yeah, it's over there by that fat girl, the big-nosed kid, the midget, and the kid with pock marks on his face.	['fat']
Michael	8	0	So we're back to that, are we?	[]
Firkle	1	1	Shit.	['shit']
Pete	9	0	Let's get out of these freakin' Gap clothes.	[]
Butters	46	0	Sorry, Eric, but I am a vampire now, and I can no longer survive on human food. And if someone must die so that I can feed, I choose thee.  Hm, wonder which side I'm supposed to do it on, hm. Probably doesn't matter.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Butters?  Butters?!	[]
Butters	12	0	I can't do it. Ah, I- I can't do it!	[]
Cartman	16	0	Dude, gross, you got spit all over my neck! Mom! Butters just gave me a hickey!	[]
Butters	25	0	I'm so hungry, but just, just remembering how that blood tasted before ju- blood is all clammy and tomato-y. It makes me wanna...	[]
Cartman	1	0	Dude!	[]
Liane	4	0	You all right, sweetie?	[]
Butters	3	0	U-huh.  Ow.	[]
Liane	4	0	What's going on?	[]
Cartman	22	2	Well, Mom, apparently Butters is gay, finds me very attractive, and, confused about his sexual identity, puked up all over my floor!	['gay', 'sexual']
Liane	2	0	Oh dear.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Yes.	[]
Michael	25	0	I walked into the cafeteria today. Rebecca Miller and Philip Russ were dressed like vampires drinking Clamato juice with four kids from the football team.	[]
Firkle	1	0	Jesus.	[]
Pete	19	0	It's like, there's more vampire kids every freakin' day. Why is this happening. I mean, why now?	[]
Michael	23	0	Doesn't matter why. Pretty soon, the whole school is going to be an endless hive of conformist happy-go-lucky vampire wannabes.	[]
Henrietta	19	0	It seems like that preppy Mike Makowski kid started all this. Maybe he's the way to stopping it.	[]
Pete	2	0	Whattaya mean?	[]
Henrietta	22	0	I mean, what do you do when you want to change vampires back to normal? You get rid of the head vampire.	[]
Pete	8	0	Does your mom know you took her car?	[]
Henrietta	3	0	Do I care?	[]
Michael	7	0	All right, this is probably good enough.	[]
Pete	4	0	Yeah, pull over here.	[]
Vampir	8	0	(Please, what do you want?! Let me go!)	[]
Michael	6	0	What should we do with him?	[]
Pete	16	0	Well, if he's a vampire, I guess we should drive a stake through his heart.	[]
Vampir	17	0	(No! I'm not really a vampire! I'm not a vam-, I'm not a vampire!)	[]
Michael	3	0	What's that?	[]
Vampir	6	0	(I'm not really a vampire.)	[]
Michael	12	0	You're not really a vampire? Really? I'm so freaking shocked.	[]
Pete	14	0	If we get the right packaging, we can just Fedex him somewhere far way.	[]
Michael	7	0	How about we send him to Transylvania?	[]
Pete	17	0	No, he'd probably see it as something to brag about someday to his little vampire buddies.	[]
Henrietta	18	0	If we're gonna send him somewhere, it should be the most horrible, most miserable place on Earth.	[]
Goths	1	0	Scottsdale.	[]
Linda	16	0	Butters, we just got a call from Mrs. Cartman. Butters?  Unbelievable! He's locked the door.	[]
Stephen	28	0	Butters, this is your father! Explain why you snuck into another boy's bedroom and gave him a hickey!  Butters?! Butters, you will open this door right now!	[]
Butters	24	0	What have I done to myself? I should have known I wouldn't have the stomach to be a vampire. I am so hungry.	[]
Stephen	14	0	Butters, you have five seconds to unlock this door!  One! Two!  Uhh, Bu-Butters?	[]
Butters	2	0	Hey Dad.	[]
Stephen	14	1	AAAARH! Buh. Bu-Butters, did you get gay with one of your schoolmates tonight?!	['gay']
Butters	14	0	I have to eat! But I can't do it. I'm getting weak.	[]
Stephen	26	0	All right! Now you listen, and you listen good! Until you stop behaving this way, you are not going to leave this room! Do you understand?!	[]
Butters	10	0	Dahhh.  I know now what I have to do!  Myah!	[]
Linda	7	0	Stephen, what has happened to our boy?	[]
Stephen	10	0	He's become something, Linda. Something that... we cannot ground.	[]
Michael	25	0	I just. Don't. Get it. We sent the head vampire kid to Scottsdale, but still more and more kids are dressing up like vampires.	[]
Henrietta	14	0	He must not have been what was causing it. It must be something else.	[]
Waitress	17	0	Hey you kids gonna order any food or just sit there and drink coffee all night again?	[]
Henrietta	3	0	Leave us alone!	[]
Waitress	19	0	Bad enough I always get stuck with you Goth kids, now I got Goth kids in my entire section.	[]
Pete	10	1	They aren't Goth! They're douchey little vampire kids!	['douchey']
Waitress	5	0	Looks the same to me.	[]
Pete	8	0	I bet they aren't even drinking coffee.	[]
Waitress	16	0	No, they said they're too young to drink caffeine, so they're havin' orange juice.	[]
Henrietta	17	0	Let's go over there and tell them they're not taking Village In from us too.	[]
Pete	29	0	Forget it! It's over, all right? There's too many of them now. We can't stop them. Let's just face it. The freakin' vampires beat us.	[]
Butters	19	0	Maybe not.  Did you say you're trying to get rid of the vampires?  I want to help you.	[]
Henrietta	3	1	Get away, douchebag.	['douchebag']
Butters	18	0	Some legends say that if you destroy the vampires' lair, the vampires go back to being human again.	[]
Pete	5	0	What are you talking about?	[]
Butters	14	0	I can take you... to the place where kids are being transformed into vampires.	[]
Pete	7	0	Awww, Hot Topic? When did this open?	[]
Butters	10	0	Two weeks ago. It used to be a Banaaana Repuuubliiic.	[]
Michael	8	0	Of course. Freaking Hot Topic. That explains everything.	[]
Pete	19	0	How did we not figure that out? Of course a new Hot Topic must have come to town. Duh!	[]
Henrietta	11	0	Well, I think we all know what has to be done.	[]
Michael	1	0	Yup.	[]
Pete	5	0	Let's get to it.	[]
Singer	59	0	Burn down down, burn down Hot Topic. Don't let it steal your soul away. Burn down, burn down Hot Topic. Light the fire. Take control. Burn down, burn down Hot Topic. Don't let it take your soul. Burn down, burn down, burn down Hot Topic. And take control. Burn down... Hot Topic. Burn it down... Hot Topic.	[]
Clerk	7	1	Hey, what the hell are you doing?!	['hell']
Pete	7	0	You should probably get out of here.	[]
Spiky Vamp	6	1	What the hell are they doing??	['hell']
Butters	7	0	They're putting an end to it!	[]
Clerk	1	0	AAAAAAAAAAAAH!	[]
Butters	5	0	Mom, Dad!  I changed back!	[]
Stephen	1	0	What?	[]
Butters	39	0	Goth kids burned down the Hot Topic, and sure enough, soon as they did I tried eatin' a hot dog and it tasted good. My vampire teeth even fell out when I bit into it. I'm human again!	[]
Linda	17	0	We have no idea what you're talking about, Butters, but we're glad you're home.	[]
Stephen	12	0	That's right son. There's only one thing I care about.	[]
Butters	4	0	What's that, Dad?	[]
Stephen	15	0	Well, would you mind telling me why there's Rice-A-Roni in my coffee?!	[]
Butters	2	0	Uh oh.	[]
Stephen	4	0	Butters, you are grounded!	[]
Butters	2	0	Ahh, dangit!	[]
Stephen	9	0	It worked, Linda. Our son is groundable once more.	[]
Pete	107	3	Fellow students. Over the past week there's been a lot of confusion, and so we have asked for this assembly to clarify the difference between Goth kids and Vampire kids. Let us make it abundantly clear: if you hate life, truly hate the sun, and need to smoke and drink coffee, you are Goth. If, however, you like dressing in black 'cause it's fun, enjoy putting sparkles on your cheeks and following the occult while avoiding things that are bad for your health, then you are most likely a douchebag vampire wannabe boner. Because anybody who thinks they are actually a vampire is freaking retarded.	['douchebag', 'boner', 'retarded']
Michael	4	1	Fuck all of you.	['fuck']
