Token	29	0	Pluto is also the furthest planet from the sun, though scientists believe more planets lie beyond it. I hope you enjoyed my report on the Solar System. Thank you.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	25	0	Okay, very nice, Token. Thank you. 'K kids, looks like we only have time for one more speech today, so let's have ah Eric.	[]
Cartman	89	5	Thank you, Mrs. Garrison.  My speech is entitled Ginger Kids: Children with red hair, light skin, and freckles.  We've all seen them - on the playground, at the store, walking on the streets - they creep us out and make us feel sick to our stomachs. I'm talking of course about... ginger kids.  Aww sick! Gross! Ginger kids are born with a disease which causes very light skin, red hair, and freckles.  Aw, nasty! Yuck!  This disease is called Gingervitus, and it occurs because ginger kids have no souls.	['ginger', 'ginger', 'ginger', 'gingervitus', 'ginger']
Kyle	1	0	What?!	[]
Cartman	26	2	Kids who have gingervitus cannot be cured.  Ah sick!  Gross!  Yeck!  Because their skin is so light, ginger kids must avoid the sun. Not unlike...  vampires.	['gingervitus', 'ginger']
Class	1	0	Aaaah.	[]
Kyle	18	0	That's not true, fatass! I have red hair, and I don't have to avoid the sun!	[]
Cartman	26	0	I was getting to that, if you will let me.  Some people have red hair, but not light skin and freckles. These people are called daywalkers.	[]
Butters	2	1	Ho! Daywalkers!	['ho']
Kyle	7	1	This is all a bunch of crap!	['crap']
Cartman	13	0	Mrs. Garrison, I'm really havin' a difficult time with all these interruptions...	[]
Mrs. Garrison	6	0	Kyle, let Eric give his presentation.	[]
Kyle	17	1	It's not a presentation, it's a hate speech! People aren't creeped out by gingers!	['gingers']
Clyde	2	0	I am.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	14	0	Kyle, if you wanna debate Eric, you can do so with your paper tomorrow!	[]
Kyle	3	0	Fine, I will!	[]
Cartman	84	5	Fine! In the meantime, shut your Goddamned daywalker mouth!  Let's see, where was I? Oh yes! Like vampires, the ginger gene is a curse,  and unless we work to rid the earth of that curse, the gingers could envelop our lives in blackness for all time. It is time that we all admit to ourselves that gingers are vile and disgusting. In conclusion, I will leave you with this: if you think that the ginger problem is not a serious one,  think again.	['goddamned', 'ginger', 'gingers', 'gingers', 'ginger']
Kyle	3	1	Stupid supremacist asswipe!	['asswipe']
Stan	6	0	Dude, what's the big deal?	[]
Kyle	33	0	What's the big deal? Don't you understand what ignorant prejudice like that can lead to? I have to disprove Cartman's hateful rumors! Do you know any red-haired, freckled kids?	[]
Stan	11	1	What about the Foley family? I think they're all ginger.	['ginger']
Three kids	1	0	Hello?	[]
Kyle	22	0	Hey. Wuh I'm giving a speech tomorrow about people with red hair and freckles. Can I ask you a few questions?	[]
Girl	4	0	Sure. Come on in.	[]
Boy	8	0	Mom, Dad, these boys wanna know about us.	[]
Father	5	0	What? Heh, hello there, kids.	[]
Kyle	15	0	We... came to learn the facts about people with red hair, light skin and freckles.	[]
Father	9	1	Oho, gingers, yes. Our cute little red-haired rascals.	['gingers']
Stan	16	0	I'm sorry, but I don't understand. You both have dark hair and brown eyes.	[]
Father	41	1	Yes, we've learned that the ginger gene is recessive in both our families' DNA. Actually, the odds of us having a red-haired freckled child were only one in four. And still it happened. Three times. What are the odds?	['ginger']
Mother	27	1	A lot of people carry the ginger gene and don't know.  If your spouse is also a carrier, then your children can turn out like... them.	['ginger']
Father	7	0	Each one of them's a blessing.	[]
Mother	9	0	Oh yes, each one of them's a blessing.	[]
Father	6	0	Huh Blesse-blessing full of love.	[]
Three kids	4	0	Thanks, Mom and Dad.	[]
Kyle	11	0	But it's... it's not true they... have no souls.	[]
Father	20	0	No... no, I'm sure they do.  Well it was nice meeting you boys. We've gotta get dinner started.	[]
Kyle	8	0	I just had a couple more questions about-	[]
Father	38	1	Look, boys, if you really don't wanna have ginger kids, marry an Asian woman. Asians don't carry the recessive gene.  I know a guy who's marrying a Japanese woman very soon for just that reason.	['ginger']
Kyle	42	0	And so, red hair, light skin, and freckles are all passed down genetically. A child's red hair is not determined by the lack of a soul,  but by the melanins which control the pigment in all of our skins. Thank you.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	36	0	Okay, very nice, Kyle. A little dry and science-y for my taste, but there you go.  All right, that's lunch, kids. We'll pick up with Clyde's speech about lesbian cheerleaders after recess.	[]
Butters	7	0	That was a very informative speech, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Thanks Butters	[]
Cartman	79	5	Informative if you want to die.  Gusy, don't forget. Kyle is a daywalker. Daywalkers are half-gingers themselves. Make no mistake: ginger kids are evil. You know who was ginger? Judas. And what did Judas do? Oh, he just got Jesus killed, that's all.  Look, I'm just saying what everyone else already thinks: Gingers are creepy. And one night, when you're all sleepin' in your room, the gingers are gonna getcha. They're gonna GETCHA!	['gingers', 'ginger', 'ginger', 'gingers', 'gingers']
Stan	5	0	You buying school lunch today?	[]
Kyle	8	0	Nah, my mom packed me a kosher lunch.	[]
Clyde	10	0	Right this way!  You can't eat in the cafeteria!	[]
Boy	2	0	How come?	[]
Token	6	1	Ginger kids eat in the hallway!	['ginger']
Jimmy	8	1	Yeah. Go on, beat it, re... rr-retard!	['retard']
Kyle	16	0	There! You see?! This is what happens when Cartman is allowed his right to free speech!	[]
Stan	17	1	That's just wrong, dude. I wish Cartman could see what it felt like to be ginger.	['ginger']
Kyle	6	0	Hey.  That's a great idea!	[]
Kenny	5	0	(What's a great idea?)	[]
Kyle	14	0	Can you guys meet me over at Cartman's house tonight at around midnight?	[]
Stan	3	0	Sure, for what?	[]
Kyle	9	2	We're gonna teach that fat bastard a lesson!	['fat', 'bastard']
Stan	21	0	Okay dude, knock him out.  Dude, dude okay, he's out!  Kyle, that's good!  All right, let's do it.	[]
Liane	8	0	Eric honey, time to get up for school.	[]
Cartman	13	0	-ed a fine time to leave me, Lucille  Four hungry children and a-	[]
Liane	6	0	Poopsiekins!  Sweetie, what is the-  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!	[]
Cartman	3	1	I'M GINGER!	['ginger']
Liane	4	0	Oh my God! Eric!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Help me! Hellp mee!	[]
Doctor	22	0	Well, all his vital signs are still normal. From his outward appearance, I would say he has the standard skin pigment deficiency.	[]
Liane	2	0	You mean...	[]
Doctor	11	1	Yes, I'm afraid that your son is suffering from gingervitus.	['gingervitus']
Cartman	14	1	And how could I become a ginger now?! I wasn't born like this!	['ginger']
Doctor	23	0	Well, the red-haired and freckle gene is a recessive gene. It must've stayed dormant in your system until you hit adolescence.	[]
Cartman	8	0	So I'm gonna stay like this forever?	[]
Doctor	59	1	I'm sorry, son.  Ms. Cartman, could I have a word with you?  Ms. Cartman, I know this must be... very difficult for you. I for one can't stand red-haired, freckled kids, but you need to understand, there is no cure. Your son will be ginger his whole life. You might want to just... put him down.	['ginger']
Liane	1	0	Oh...	[]
Cartman	22	0	Agh, excuse me, Doctor, but it just so happens my mom loves me, no matter what I look like!  Right, Mom?!  Mom?!	[]
Liane	6	0	Oh ye-yes, of course,sweetie.	[]
Doctor	30	0	All right, but... you're gonna have to take certain precautions now. It's very important that you keep Eric out of the sun. The sun... is his worst enemy.	[]
Cartman	12	0	Hey dudes, what's goin' on?  How is everything with you guys?	[]
Kyle	5	0	Wow, Cartman. You look... different.	[]
Cartman	27	0	Yes, well, it's interesting you should point that out, Kyle. I went to the doctor yesterday, and apparently I suffer from a small skin pigment deficiency.	[]
Stan	6	1	You mean,you're a ginger?	['ginger']
Cartman	6	1	Actually, gingervitus is the medical term.	['gingervitus']
Kyle	7	0	Is that an umbrella you're using?	[]
Cartman	46	0	Yes, Kyle.  The sun's rays are bad for my skin, so I need to be protected when I'm outside. Well, I'm glad we've gotten all that out of the way, and now we can just go on with our lives as normal.	[]
Kyle	9	0	...Wow, that's a little ironic, isn't it?	[]
Cartman	5	0	What do you mean, Kyle?	[]
Kyle	17	1	Well, I mean, all last week you were ripping on ginger kids and now you are one.	['ginger']
Cartman	11	0	Hm. I don't really see the irony in that, Kyle.	[]
Cartman	10	0	That's fine, just get it out of the way...	[]
Kyle	5	0	Dude, this is going awesome.	[]
Stan	9	0	Maybe he'll actually learn a lesson this time.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Hey Clyde, Token. Sup, Jim?	[]
Token	4	0	What are you doing?	[]
Cartman	8	0	I'm grubbin'. What's it look like?	[]
Clyde	9	0	You're not supposed to be in the cafeteria.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Huh?	[]
Craig	10	1	You know the rule. No ginger kids in the cafeteria.	['ginger']
Cartman	4	0	But... it's me.	[]
Clyde	6	1	Right. And you're a ginger.	['ginger']
Kyle	4	0	Dude, check it out.	[]
Cartman	20	2	Guys! Okay, look, maybe I'm ginger, but... I'm not like other ginger kids. I'm still me inside.	['ginger', 'ginger']
Clyde	16	1	Sorry. If we let one ginger kid in here, then the others are gonna start coming.	['ginger']
Jimmy	5	1	Yeah, beat it, j... jackass.	['jackass']
Kyle	28	1	We did it guys. We finally taught Cartman a lesson. I'll bet that now, Cartman is gonna have a long hard think about how he treated gingers.	['gingers']
Cartman	54	1	I want to thank everyone for showing up today. I've called this meeting because, I don't know about you, but for one am sick and tired of being discriminated against! Just because we have red hair, light skin and freckles, we're thought of as somehow less important, and it's bullcrap!	['bullcrap']
Boy	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Cartman	31	0	Kids at school laugh at us, doctors call us genetically inferior. The world needs to know that we are people, with feelings! And our parents love us for who we are!	[]
Older Boy	15	0	My dad says that each one of my freckles is a kiss from an angel.	[]
Cartman	35	1	...Riiight, exactly! We can't let this go on any longer! We should be PROUD of who we are! Think about all the great people in history who were ginger. People like...  Like uh...  Liiike...	['ginger']
Girl	2	0	Ron Howard?	[]
Cartman	6	0	Right! Ron Howard! And uh... Aaaaand...	[]
Older Boy	2	0	Ron Howard?	[]
Cartman	53	1	Right! We already had him, but right! See? Ginger people go on to do amazing things in society! We need to let everyone in this school know that we are not inferior! That we are in fact beautiful, totally awesome, and super-smart. It's time for us to take back our pride!	['ginger']
Kids	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Red Power!	[]
Gingers	2	0	Red Power!	[]

Gingers	2	0	Red Power!	[]
Cartman	32	1	We gingers are proud people! We are the noble descendants of great Americans like Ron Howard, and ...others! We will not be discriminated against any longer, for we are a great race!	['gingers']

Cartman	2	0	Red Power!	[]
Gingers	2	0	Red Power!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Red Power!	[]
Gingers	2	0	Red Power!	[]
Kyle	5	0	I don't believe it.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Red Power!	[]
Stan	6	0	Should we tell him the truth?	[]
Gingers	2	0	Red Power!	[]
Kyle	15	1	Nah, let him make a complete ass out of himself for a little while longer.	['ass']
Cartman	2	0	Red Power!	[]

Reporter	66	2	Tom, I'm standing outside the Denver Center For The Performing Arts, where the new production of Annie has just premiered to cries of outrage.  A rapidly-growing organization called The Ginger Separatist Movement is furious that the lead role of Annie  is being played by a girl  who isn't actually red-haired and freckled. Joining me now is the gingers' head spokesperson, Eric Cartman.	['ginger', 'gingers']
Cartman	19	2	That's right! This is bullcrap! We True Gingers are furious that the role of Annie is being minimalized!	['bullcrap', 'gingers']
Reporter	15	0	What harm do you believe this actress is doing to the true red-haired community?	[]
Cartman	27	4	The bitch isn't ginger! She's just using makeup to look ginger! And pretending to be ginger with makeup is the worst thing anybody can do!	['bitch', 'ginger', 'ginger', 'ginger']
Gingers	4	0	Yeah! That's right!	[]
Cartman	9	1	There she is! Get her!  Die, you stupid bitch!	['bitch']
Reporter	42	3	This is getting pretty ugly, Tom. These gingers are really riled up! If you are a ginger and would like to join The Ginger Separatist Movement, you can attend their first meeting this Friday in the Sunset Room at the Airport Hilton.	['gingers', 'ginger', 'ginger']
Older Boy	38	2	Okay, welcome, everyone. It's so great to see such a wonderful turnout at the first All-Ginger Pride Conference!  Now it is my honor to introduce the man who has brought self-respect to gingers, Eric Cartman!	['ginger', 'gingers']
Cartman	13	1	Thanks Jody! Gingers, how are we feelin'?  Can I get a Red Power?	['gingers']
Gingers	2	0	Red Power!	[]
Cartman	72	0	Oh yeah! That feels good, doesn't it? Feels good to be proud of who you are! Now I don't think I need to tell you there's a lot of hate out there. Hate for awesome people like us. And if there's one thing I've learned, is that the only way to fight hate, is with more hate! We are not the freaks of society, everyone else is!	[]
Gingers	1	0	Yeah!!	[]
Cartman	26	1	Gingers are the chosen people! The chosen race! And we must view the rest of the world as the lowlife, dark-skinned rats that they are!	['gingers']
Gary Nelson	17	0	Hello there! Gary Nelson with Hilton Guest Relations. Just making sure you guys have everything you need.	[]
Cartman	4	0	We're fine, thanks.	[]
Gary Nelson	9	0	Need any buffet items restocked? Everyone okay on coffee?	[]
Cartman	3	0	We're fine!	[]
Gary Nelson	18	0	Great. Oh, and hey guys, just wanted to say thanks for choosing the Airport Hilton for your conference.	[]
Cartman	41	3	You're welcome!! Now leave us alone!!  My fellow gingers! I envision a world in which there IS no hate! A world where everyone is ginger! And so, we must gather together every child who is NOT ginger, and exterminate them!	['gingers', 'ginger', 'ginger']
Ginger 1	1	0	Huh	[]
Ginger 2	1	0	What	[]
Ginger 3	2	0	Ex-terminate?	[]
Cartman	50	2	Now go! Go out into the night and take non-ginger kids from their homes! We will eradicate them all with cages and tortures and a pit of lava to thrown them all in! Now I am not gonna live my life as a Goddamned minority! Are you with me?!	['ginger', 'goddamned']
Gingers	2	0	Wirha! atta!	[]
Kyle	17	1	Dude, we're gonna go sneak into Cartman's and change him back into a non-ginger!	['ginger']
Stan	2	0	Huh? Why?	[]
Kyle	31	3	Because now he's acting like gingers are awesome. And all his friends are gingers. When he wakes up tomorrow and realizes he isn't really ginger, it'll be hysterical!	['gingers', 'gingers', 'ginger']
Kenny	3	0	(Hehe, yeah. Hehe)	[]
Kyle	3	0	Are you in?	[]
Stan	1	0	... totally.	[]
Stan	65	3	You know, Cartman is an uncaring, bigoted intolerant asshole, but I have to admit, I had my own prejudice about gingers. I think we all need to realize that everyone is different in one way or another, and we shouldn't be threatened by those differences. I mean, Cartman had me kind of creeped out that gingers were gonna come get me in the night.	['asshole', 'gingers', 'gingers']
Kenny	3	0	(Hehe, yeah, heh)	[]
Kyle	3	0	Oh... hey there.	[]
Stan	4	0	You guys... need... anything?	[]
Kyle	9	0	Let's just... let's just walk this way.	[]
Stan	11	1	More ginger kids. Um, meh-maybe we should just go home.	['ginger']
Kyle	3	0	Yeah, good idea.	[]
Stan	5	1	The hell do they want?	['hell']
Kenny	1	0	(AH!)	[]
Kyle	1	0	Kenny!	[]
Stan	3	0	Run, dude, run!!	[]
Clyde	5	1	Uh... Gi... ginger kids! AAAAAH!	['ginger']
Mom	5	0	Clyde? What is it, honey?	[]
Boy	4	1	Aaah!  Ginger kids! Nooo!	['ginger']
Ginger Girl	4	0	Laaa la, laaa lala.	[]
Girl	3	0	What is it?	[]
Ginger Girl	2	0	laaa lala.	[]
Boy	6	1	It's a... little ginger girl.	['ginger']
Ginger Girl	2	0	laaa la.	[]
Girl	3	0	Shut the door!	[]
Ginger Girl	6	0	Laaa la, laaa lala, laaa la.	[]
Kids	1	0	AAAAAH!	[]
Boy	1	0	Ow!	[]
Ginger Girl	4	0	Laaa la, laaa lala.	[]
Kyle	11	0	In there! Let's go!  Get this jamb on the door!	[]
Stan	4	0	Kyle. Kyle, wake up.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Huh. Whaaa?  Where are we?	[]
Stan	12	0	I think we're at the Sunset Room at the Airport Hilton.	[]
Cartman	11	1	My fellow gingers! The day of reckoning is finally upon us!	['gingers']
Stan	1	0	Cartman?	[]
Kyle	6	0	Oh Jesus, I should have known!	[]
Cartman	19	1	What we begin here, we will take worldwide, until the blood of every non-ginger child has been spilled!	['ginger']
Gary Nelson	13	0	You guys got everything you need in here? Need more coffee, buffet items?	[]
Cartman	6	0	No, we're fine! Thank you!	[]
Gary Nelson	7	0	How about lava? You got enough lava?	[]
Cartman	4	0	Yes! We're good!	[]
Gary Nelson	9	0	Okay. Hey, thanks for choosin' the Airport Hilton, guys.	[]
Cartman	18	0	You're welcome, now leave us alone!!  Now! Let the extermination begin!  We will start... with the daywalker!	[]
Gingers	4	0	Daywalker!  Throw him in!	[]
Kyle	7	0	Cartman! I need to tell you something!	[]
Cartman	7	0	Go on then! Say your last words!	[]
Kyle	10	0	Aah I think you'd rather hear this in private!	[]
Cartman	15	1	Okay fine, let him speak!  Then we kill every non-ginger here!  You... you what?	['ginger']
Ginger Boy	12	1	Come on, let's fulfill the plan! All non-gingers must die!	['gingers']
Gingers	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Cartman	31	0	Right, the plan. Um... Oh. Oh, my God, you guys! Uh, I just realized something.  We shouldn't be doing this. Ah I mean, look at us.  What have we become?	[]
Gingers	2	0	Huh? What?	[]
Cartman	37	1	D-don't you see? If we go and exterminate everyone who isn't ginger, then we're no better than they were for thinking less of us. Maybe we all have to learn to live... together.	['ginger']
Ginger Boy 2	11	1	But... you just said everyone who isn't ginger must die.	['ginger']
Cartman	18	0	Right, but... but I've learned that we can't judge people based on what they look like.	[]
Ginger Boy 2	11	0	But you just said they should all die fifteen seconds ago.	[]
Cartman	20	0	See I know, I know, but I I get it now. We we've got to live and let live.	[]
Ginger Boy	10	0	What did that kid in the green hat tell you?	[]
Cartman	1	0	... Huh?	[]
Ginger Boy	10	0	That kid right there. What did he just tell you?	[]
Cartman	17	0	Ss. Who? Oh him? Oh. No, that was just... Tha-that was about something else, totally unrelated.	[]
Ginger Boy	36	1	You wanted to kill everyone who wasn't ginger, then that kid in the green hat told you something, and now you don't wanna do it all of a sudden. What did he tell you?	['ginger']
Cartman	103	2	No, he was just telling me about something funny that happened at school yesterday. Um, oh, but anyway, ohhh! Oh wow, I can't believe how great it feels to finally love my fellow man, huh? Isn't this great you guys? We sure have been throgh a lot! But in the end, we all learned it's best to get along. Hand in hand, we can live together. Ginger or not, we're all the same. Black or white, brown or red, we shouldn't kill each other, 'cause it's lame. Come on, guys! Hand in hand, we can live together.	['ginger', 'lame']
Gingers	8	1	Ginger or not, it's all the same.	['ginger']
Cartman	7	0	That's it! You've got it!	[]
Cartman and the Gingers	23	1	Black or white, brown or red, we shouldn't kill each other, 'cause dying's lame.  Hand in hand, we can live together.	['lame']
Cartman	2	0	Live together!	[]
Gingers	12	0	We shouldn't kill each other 'cause we're all the same.	[]
Cartman	5	0	The same, you and I!	[]
Gingers	16	1	Black or white, brown or red, we shouldn't kill each other, 'cause dying's lame.	['lame']
Kyle	7	1	You are such a manipulative asshole, Cartman.	['asshole']
Cartman	16	0	Yes, but I'm not going to die.  That's why we gotta get along, people!	[]
Gingers	19	0	Hand in hand, we can live together. We shouldn't kill each other 'cause we're all the same.	[]
Gingers	70	2	Black or white, brown or red, we shouldn't kill each other, 'cause dying's lame. Hand in hand, we can live together. We shouldn't kill each other 'cause we're all the same.
