Cartman	18	0	We can't let her get away with this!  I think tonight we need to do something drastic.	[]
Stan	2	0	Like what?	[]

Stan	6	0	D'you think that's enough?	[]
Cartman	3	0	Should be fine.	[]
Kyle	21	0	Don't you guys think this is a little suspicious? We should buy something else so it doesn't look obvious.	[]

Cartman	6	0	Heh yeah, that that's right.	[]
Cashier	4	0	... Toilet paper  Toilet paper	[]
Kyle	8	0	You TP'ed a house last week, Cartman?	[]
Cartman	7	0	No. Last Thursday night was fajitas night.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Oh.  Uuugh.	[]
Stan	5	0	Is this the right house?	[]
Cartman	16	0	It's the right address-wait! Look there!  There's Mrs. Streible! This is the place.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Oh wait, wait, there's kids inside.	[]
Cartman	1	0	So?	[]
Kyle	12	0	So we're not TP'ing a house with kids inside it!	[]
Stan	7	0	Kyle, we all agreed to do this!	[]
Kyle	9	0	We didn't say nothin' about no kids, man!	[]
Cartman	31	3	Kyle, you're bein' an asshole! Now let's do this thing and get out of m'yeah.  Here's what I think of your art class, you God-damned bitch!	['asshole', 'damned', 'bitch']
Kenny	3	1	(Yeah! Fuck you!)	['fuck']
Cartman	5	0	Come on, let's go!	[]
Kyle	4	0	What have we done?	[]
Stan	4	0	Let's go, Kyle!	[]
Kyle	12	0	We're, we're in trouble. We're in sooo much trouble.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Aw man, that was sooo awesome!	[]
Kyle	23	0	How can you say that? Did you see what we did to their house?! It'll take them days to clean that up!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Who cares??	[]
Kyle	12	1	Well, YOU don't, because you're a non-caring asshole, Cartman!	['asshole']
Cartman	10	0	Me??  There's toilet paper on your hands, too, Kyle.	[]
Stan	10	0	Cartman's right, Kyle. We're all in this together.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Noo! No.  Noo!	[]
Mrs. Streible	1	0	AAAAAAAAA!	[]
Mr. Streible	9	0	Honey, what is it?? Oh, Jesus no! Our house!	[]
The Streible Girls	2	0	Mommy! Mommy!	[]
Mr. Streible	2	0	Whyyy? Whyyy?	[]
Kyle	5	0	Ah! Oh God! Oh God!	[]
Butters	18	0	Hey, uh, you guys here what happened last night? Mrs. Streible's house got covered with toilet paper.	[]
Clyde	14	0	Yeah. They say it's gonna take three weeks to get it all down.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Yeah? Well, Ol' Mrs. Streible probably had it comin' to her.	[]
Butters	14	0	I don't know. I don't think anybody deserves that kind of brutality.	[]
Cartman	26	0	Well, I understand the people who did it weren't caughts, so-o... Looks like nobody will ever know the geniuses who masterminded that perfect crime.	[]
Mr. Garrison	24	0	Okay children, let's take our seats. Oh, uh, Stan, Kyle, Eric, and Kenny, the counselor wants to see you in his office, now.	[]
Cartman	1	1	Damn!	['damn']
Kyle	2	0	Oh God!	[]
Kyle	15	1	How the hell did they find out it was us that TP'ed that house?	['hell']
Cartman	22	0	Will you relax, Kyle?! They have nothing on us! As long as we all stick to our story, we'll be fine.	[]
Stan	15	0	We'd better go over our story again so we don't screw it up.	[]
Cartman	136	0	Okay. Last night, all four of us were at the bowling alley until about 7:30, at which time we noticed Ally Sheedy, the Goth chick from the Breakfast Club, was bowling in the lane next to us, and we asked her for her autograph, but she didn't have a pen, so we followed her out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46.	[]
Kyle	10	0	I'm confused. Did Ally Sheedy take that personality test?	[]
Stan	2	0	Yes, dude!	[]
Cartman	92	0	Kyle, it's very simple: we followed Ally Sheedy out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46, you got it??	[]
Kyle	6	0	Ah, Ah I, ah I thought...	[]
Cartman	5	0	Oh, for Christ's sake!	[]
Stan	19	0	Look, Kyle, just let Cartman do all the talking, okay? He's better at being in trouble than anybody.	[]
Cartman	36	0	Thank you, Stan.  Sh sh, here they come, here they come.  And so I said, 'That's a terrific joke, Wendy. Tell us another one.' Oh, hello, Mr. Mackey. Are you ready to see us now?	[]
Mr. Mackey	21	0	We're gonna talk to you one at a time, boys, m'kay? Kenny, will you step into my office, please?	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Me??)	[]
Mr. Mackey	7	0	Come on, Kenny, let's go, 'k?	[]
Cartman	4	0	Touche, Mr. Mackey, touche.	[]
Kyle	9	0	Why are they doing us one at a time?	[]
Cartman	24	0	They want to see if we mix the story up, and see if someone will rat out the other three for a better deal.	[]
Kyle	6	0	I can get a better deal?	[]
Cartman	18	2	Kyle, so help me God, if you Jew us out on this one, I will fucking kill you!	['jew', 'fucking']
Mr. Streible	20	0	There we go. That should be about the last of it.  Ex- excuse me, uh, wha-what are you doing?	[]
Officer Barbrady	15	0	Crime scene investigation!  There are several footprints in the snow. Perhaps more than one perpetrator?	[]
Mr. Streible	14	0	Ah... look, we really don't wanna make a big deal out of this.	[]
Officer Barbrady	15	0	Is that the toilet paper there? I'll need to take those bags as evidence.	[]
Mr. Streible	23	0	Lo-ih ih it's just not that big a deal, I mean, I toilet-papered houses myself when I was a kid.	[]
Officer Barbrady	10	0	You?! So where were you last night at around 9?!	[]
Mr. Streible	3	0	I was here.	[]
Officer Barbrady	3	0	Aha!! Got you!	[]
Mr. Streible	8	0	Officer, why would I TP my own house?	[]
Officer Barbrady	1	0	Insurance?	[]
Mr. Streible	20	0	It wasn't me, okay? Now, if you don't mind, I just wanna get my yard back to normal.	[]
Officer Barbrady	39	0	Now you listen to me! Whoever TP'ed your house is still out there roaming the streets. It's only a matter of time before another house and another family is victimized! I have to stop that from happening.	[]
Mr. Streible	9	0	You really have nothing better to do, do you?	[]
Officer Barbrady	4	0	No I do not.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Noo! No.  Noo!	[]
Mrs. Streible	1	0	AAAAAAAAA!	[]
Mr. Streible	5	0	Oh, Jesus no! Our house!	[]
The Streible Girls	2	0	Mommy! Mommy!	[]
Nancy Kerrigan	3	0	Whyyy? Whyyy? Whyyy?	[]
Kyle	11	0	Oh God! Oh God! I have to tell the truth!  Mooooomm!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Hello, Kyle. Going somewhere?	[]
Kyle	12	0	I was... I was just going to get a drink of water.	[]
Cartman	9	0	No need. I have one for you right here.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Oh. Okay. Thanks.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Is there anything else I can get for you?	[]
Kyle	10	0	Noo, I'll just... be... going back to bed now.	[]
Cartman	5	0	You do that. Goodnight, Kyle.	[]
Warden	18	0	Josh Meyers TP'ed over six hundred houses in less than a year.  He's a real monster.	[]
Officer Barbrady	13	0	I just need to talk to someonen who knows how toilet paperers think.	[]
Warden	23	0	Just remember: he'd toilet-paper you in a second if he had the chance.  He's the last cell on your left.	[]
Officer Barbrady	14	0	Hello, Josh. My name is Officer Barbrady. I'm with the South Park police.	[]
Josh	15	0	That's a terrible cologne you're wearing, officer. You should try something more... casual.	[]
Officer Barbrady	12	0	I was hoping you could help me solve a toilet-papering case?	[]
Josh	13	0	And why would I do that? Because I'm such a charming fella?	[]
Officer Barbrady	12	0	Uh please, I need your help. What would you want in return?	[]
Josh	27	0	Due to the harsh nature of my crimes they don't allow me to have toilet paper in my cell. You can imagine how bothersome that becomes.	[]
Officer Barbrady	10	0	You... know I can't give you toilet paper, Josh.	[]
Josh	37	0	No, but it was worth a try, wasn't it?  Tell me something, officer: why is it that you police such a small town. You must have had larger inspirations. What happened to those... big-city dreams?	[]
Officer Barbrady	6	0	Well, that's kind of personal.	[]
Josh	22	0	Quid pro quo, officer. Tell me what I want to know. And I'll help you catch whoever toilet-papered that house.	[]
Officer Barbrady	19	0	Look kid, I have very little time to catch whoever toilet-papered that house. Tell me what you know.	[]
Josh	30	0	Are those the crime scene photos? Let me see them.  Yes. Yes. Not bad work, not bad at all. These toilet-paperers are professionals...at least one of them is.	[]
Officer Barbrady	9	0	So you think there was more than one. Why?	[]
Josh	36	0	Tell me something first. When you went to the academy you had something to prove. You wanted to protect and serve, but mostly you wanted to protect yourself. Who were you protecting yourself from, Officer Barbrady?	[]
Officer Barbrady	15	0	Oh all right, all right, my uncle Charles used to hit me with a belt!	[]
Josh	51	0	Thank you. Your toilet-paperers are most like males between the ages of 8 and 10 and probably virgins. Parents notice that much toilet paper missing, so they would have to have bought it themselves. Find out where the toilet paper came from, officer, and you just might catch your man.	[]
Cartman	28	0	Stan, Kenny, can I talk to you guys for a second?  I think we have the counselor and the principal fooled, but we need to talk about Kyle.	[]
Stan	3	0	What about him?	[]
Cartman	12	1	Come on, you know. He's losing it. He's gonna crack.	['crack']
Kenny	4	0	(I think so too.)	[]
Cartman	25	0	Kyle can't take the heat; he's gonna sing like a canary. Then we're all gonna take the fall for what we did.	[]
Butters	3	0	Ha-ey fellas.	[]
Stan	1	0	Butters.	[]
Cartman	22	1	Look you guys, all it takes is for one of us to crack, and we all know who the weakest link is!	['crack']
Stan	5	0	So what should we do?	[]
Cartman	9	0	We have no choice. We have to kill Kyle.	[]
Stan	6	0	... Dude, we're not killing Kyle!	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Yeah!)	[]
Cartman	2	0	Why not?	[]
Stan	7	0	Kyle's not gonna say anything, alright?	[]
Cartman	39	0	He almost spilled the beans in the counselor's office! He can't even keep the story straight! I'm telling you guys, he's weak. He's weak, and he'll be the end of all of us.	[]
Cashier	7	0	You wanted to see me, Officer Barbrady?	[]
Officer Barbrady	39	0	Yes, thanks for coming, Mr. Bell. A house was TP'ed in South Park and I need to see if you can identify the toilet paper I recovered from the scene.  I'm... sorry I have to do this.	[]
Mr. Bell	3	0	Oh my God.	[]
Officer Barbrady	7	0	Is this toilet paper from your store?	[]
Mr. Bell	21	0	It's... difficult to tell, it's... so decayed, I... wait a minute, yes. Yes, I recognize the floral pattern now.	[]
Officer Barbrady	6	0	Positive ID on the toilet paper.	[]
Mr. Bell	8	0	Who would... do this to toilet paper? Who?	[]
Officer Barbrady	15	0	Mr. Bell, do you remember anyone suspicious buying toilet paper in the last few days?	[]
Mr. Bell	3	0	Suspicious like how?	[]
Officer Barbrady	11	0	Well, like someone who was black or Mexican or Middle Eastern.	[]
Mr. Bell	26	0	Nnoo, the only Mexican guy I recall bought toasted tarts and chips and... we don't allow Middle Eastern people in the store.  Oh my God!	[]
Kyle	6	0	What's this all about, Cartman?	[]
Cartman	21	0	I just wanted to see how you're doing, Kyle. Why don't we go out for a little boat ride?	[]
Kyle	3	0	A boat ride?	[]
Cartman	11	0	I just thought we should find a private place to... talk.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Well, okay.	[]
Cartman	22	0	Could you help me put this cement block and chain in the boat?  Okay, let's go.  So how are things, Kyle?	[]
Kyle	29	0	Terrible. Every time I close my eyes I see the house we TP'ed. I see the tears of our art teacher and hear the screams of her daughters.	[]
Cartman	8	0	And you feel like you have to confess.	[]
Kyle	60	1	I don't know what to do.  Part of me feels like I wanna end it all now.  Tell people what heppened. You know, I never knew how beautiful this pond was before.  So cold. The world can feel like that.  So calm on the outside, as if nothing bad ever happens.  Ow.  What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!	['hell']
Cartman	21	0	I'm killing you. But unfortunately I could only afford a Wiffle ball bat, so it's gonna take a while.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Cartman!	[]
Cartman	15	0	Don't fight it, Kyle, it will only take longer. Just slip into sweet unconsciousness.	[]
Kyle	16	0	You wanna kill me?! Fine!  I can't live like this anymore! Go ahead! Do it!	[]
Cartman	5	0	Won't be long, Kyle.	[]
Officer Barbrady	5	0	Josh, I need your help.	[]
Josh	14	0	The answer is right in front of you, but you can't see it.	[]
Officer Barbrady	4	0	How do you mean?	[]
Josh	8	0	Tell me, the toilet paper. Was it quilted?	[]
Officer Barbrady	1	0	Yes.	[]
Josh	2	0	Single-sheet?	[]
Officer Barbrady	9	0	No, two-ply.  What? What does that tell you?	[]
Josh	6	0	Why does one toilet-paper houses	[]
Officer Barbrady	3	0	To get revenge.	[]
Josh	20	0	No, that is incidental. Your toilet-paperers wanted to transform the art teacher's house, thus transforming her entire occupation.	[]
Officer Barbrady	4	0	What do you mean?	[]
Josh	13	0	Your uncle, who hit you with a belt. Was he a large man?	[]
Officer Barbrady	8	0	I don't have time for this, kid.	[]
Josh	20	0	Did he stink like bayer when he came home from work all powoor from playin' down at the pool hiyouse?	[]
Officer Barbrady	24	0	Alright alright my dad dressed me up like a little girl on poker nights and he made me sit on all my uncles' laps!	[]
Josh	26	0	Whoa. Uh, oh. Thank you. Your toilet-paperers are most likely students in the art teacher's class, students who aren't very good at art.	[]
Officer Barbrady	7	0	Oh. Of course! One of her students!	[]
Josh	18	0	Fly along now, Officer Barbrady. You've got some arrests to make.  Fly fly flyyy. Fly fly flyyy.	[]
Warden	11	0	Josh,  were you doing the silly voice for the policeman again?	[]
Josh	2	0	No, sir.	[]
Stan	5	0	Cartman, what are you doing?	[]
Cartman	16	0	I'm getting rid of our problem. Kyle will be dead in a matter of hours.	[]
Stan	17	0	You don't have to kill Kyle, dude. The police made an arrest. And the person confessed!	[]
Cartman	2	0	They did?	[]
Kyle	2	0	They did?	[]
Stan	14	0	They say they got the guy that did it down at the police station.	[]
Kyle	8	0	Who confessed? That doesn't make any sense.	[]
Cartman	6	0	But can I still kill Kyyyle?	[]
Officer Barbrady	5	0	Hello boys. How are you?	[]
Stan	18	0	We heard that you have the person who TP'ed the art teacher's house? Is that true?	[]
Officer Barbrady	3	0	It sure is!	[]
Cartman	7	0	Uh, can we see them-him-her?	[]
Officer Barbrady	16	0	Right over here.  Yeah, we interrogated the suspect for over forty hours, and he finally cracked.	[]
Butters	2	0	Hey fellas!	[]
Stan	1	0	Butters?	[]
Butters	5	0	Yep. I'm in jail.	[]
Kyle	3	0	You con-fessed?	[]
Butters	37	0	Uh huh. Unh, they said I TP'ed the art teacher's house.  I don't seem to remember it,  but they're pretty sure it was me.  I just can't get my behavior under control!	[]
Officer Barbrady	8	0	His parents are on their way down now.	[]
Butters	18	0	Yeah. And boy, are they gonna uh let me have it! Just wait till my father gets here!	[]
Kyle	9	0	You guys, we can't let him do this!	[]
Cartman	26	0	What are you talking about? This is a gift from God. An early Easter present all wrapped up in a pretty ribbon from Jesus Christ himself!	[]
Butters	32	1	Well I'm just a little asshole, is what I am. When God made me, he must have not been payin' very close attention, 'cause I turned out wrong! Just plain wrong!	['asshole']
Kyle	8	0	Officer Barbrady, Butters didn't TP that house.	[]
Officer Barbrady	5	0	Why do you say that?	[]
Kyle	3	0	Because it was-	[]
Cartman	12	0	Wiffle ball, anyone?  Anyone care for a nice game of Wiffle ball?	[]
Butters	49	0	You know, it's not my parents I'm worried about. It's my girlfriend, Carrie. Why, she lives in Michigan. But when she finds out about this, woooo smokey, is she gonna be sore! She might even break up with me. And it would serve me right, too.	[]
Officer Barbrady	11	0	All right, boys, visiting time is over. Thanks for stopping by.	[]
Cartman	27	0	You see guys, it all worked itself out. Tadow, tadow, how you like me now? Feel a little silly now, Kyle? Tadow, how you like me now?	[]
Kyle	5	0	I still feel bad, Cartman	[]
Cartman	15	0	What? Hu- How can you feel bad? Somebody else is gonna pay for our crime.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Yeah. That makes it even worse.	[]
Cartman	20	0	Bu... ...eh... Kyle, you don't seem to understand. We're we're not gonna get punished for this. Ever.	[]
Kyle	2	0	I know.	[]
Cartman	8	0	So... so then, how can you feel bad?	[]
Stan	14	0	He feels guilty for doing it and for letting someone else pay for it.	[]
Cartman	8	0	...But he's not gonna get in trouble.	[]
Stan	26	0	It doesn't matter if you get in trouble of not, you can still feel bad.  I think you're right, Kyle. Maybe we should confess.	[]
Kenny	4	0	(Yeah, maybe we should.)	[]
Cartman	19	0	What?? Eh...  hey you guys! There's nothing to feel bad about! We're, we're off scot-free!	[]
Kyle	6	0	We feel bad for other people.	[]
Cartman	19	0	For oth-er...  Uh. Oww. ...Ih ...Ih, ih, is it that ...you think you might get in trouble later?	[]
Stan	36	0	Tomorrow in school we'll all tell the teacher it was us, and let her decide what to do.  And Cartman, if you had any thread of a conscience at all, you'll do the same!	[]
Cartman	7	0	Eh buh... eh... eh... Freakin' weirdos, man!	[]
Stephen	11	0	Well well well! I had to see it to believe it!	[]
Butters	2	0	Hi, Dad.	[]
Stephen	14	0	Don't you Hi, Dad me! Look at you! Standing behind prison bars! Again!	[]
Butters	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Linda	20	1	What fibs have you been telling this policeman, Butters?! You know damn well you didn't toilet-paper that house!	['damn']
Officer Barbrady	1	0	Huh??	[]
Stephen	8	0	Butters was with us all night, Officer Barbrady.	[]
Linda	19	0	Butters, what have we told you about confessing to crimes you didn't commit?! We have had it, mister!	[]
Butters	16	0	Well, he kept accusin' me for hours, and then he shot me up with sodium pentathol.	[]
Stephen	5	0	And that's your excuse?!	[]
Officer Barbrady	16	0	Well, looks like I made a mistake. I... guess I'd better let you out now.	[]
Stephen	10	0	Just wait till we get you home, you little fibber!	[]
Butters	7	0	Officer, can I stay in jail, please?	[]
Cartman	7	0	Come on, you guys! Hurry!  Guys, hurry!	[]
Stan	4	0	What is it, Cartmam?	[]
Cartman	7	0	It's over this way! Come on!	[]
Cartman	5	0	So how are things, guys?	[]
Stan	11	0	Cartman, we're confessing tomorrow in school, and that's final.	[]
Cartman	9	0	I'm afraid I can't let that happen.	[]
Kyle	9	0	You can't kill all three of us, Cartman!	[]
Cartman	3	0	Can't I?	[]
Officer Barbrady	37	0	Excuse me, everyone.  I have someone with me who can tell us all who toilet-papered the art teacher's house!  Josh insisted he be able to tell you the names of the toilet paperers in person.	[]
Mr. Mackey	14	0	Uh, that's nice, Officer Barbrady, but we actually don't need to know-	[]
Kyle	16	0	Hold it!  Principal Victoria, Mr. Mackey, Mrs. Streible. We have something we need to tell you.	[]
Principal Victoria	11	0	All right. Will you people stop barging into my office, please?	[]
Josh	24	1	What's the matter, Principal Victoria? Was your mother abusive? Did she spank your thighs with cold cuts and stick umbrellas up your ass?	['ass']
Principal Victoria	5	0	Get him out of here!	[]
Officer Barbrady	9	0	Uh, Policeman Brown, will you take Josh outside, please?	[]
Josh	12	0	Ooo, Polceman Brown, never quite made officer. Why is that, Polceman Brown?	[]
Kyle	10	0	We have to confess that we were the ones that-	[]
Mr. Mackey	11	0	It's too late, boys, m'kay? We already know everything.	[]
Stan	4	0	You, you do? How?	[]
Cartman	2	0	Hi guys.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Cartman??	[]
Cartman	9	0	I told them everything, you guys. It's over.	[]
Principal Victoria	14	0	Luckily for us, one of you had enough of a conscience to come forward.	[]
Cartman	7	0	My consciences just caught up with me.	[]
Kyle	4	0	That's not fair!	[]
Mr. Mackey	16	0	You all get two weeks of detention, except Eric, who gets one week for being brave.	[]
