Board Rep	136	3	Last week the students of this school participated in the Presidential Fitness Test. I'm sad to announce that South Park Elementary scored the lowest in health and fitness in the entire country.  On the whole, you students actually scored fine. But the President's Fitness Test is scored on a school-wide average, and one fourth grader at this school scored so low, with a terrifying body fat score, , and high blood pressure and the cholesterol levels of a seventy-year-old man, that it actually brought you entire school's average down to the lowest in the country.  However, the Presidential Fitness Program never wants to single out one child, because then that child might feel bad. And so as far as we're concerned, you're all a bunch of fat fuckin' pigs.	['fat', 'fat', 'fuckin']
Principal Victoria	9	0	Ah, could you please use a little different terminology?	[]
Board Rep	43	2	Sorry. As far as the board is concerned, you're all a bunch of fat fuckin' pigs. And so it is the recommendation of this board that every week, each class will alternate turns, giving up their recesses and instead reporting to PE.	['fat', 'fuckin']
Assembly	1	0	AWWW!	[]
Coach	15	0	Alright, fourth grade class, you're up first. We're gonna do some rope-climbin'.	[]
Stan	3	0	God this sucks!	[]
Kyle	6	0	Four weeks we gotta do this?	[]
Cartman	21	0	Well let's just suck it up, guys. All we can try to do is have a positive attitude about it.	[]
Coach	10	0	Alright McCormick, let's start with you. Climb the rope.	[]
Cartman	28	0	Heheh! Look at Kenny. He's so poor, huh you guys? His family's so poor they couldn't pay the three ninety nine for the gym outfit.	[]
Coach	5	0	Alright, let's go Broflovski.	[]
Cartman	19	2	Heheheheheh! Look you guys, a Jew on a rope. You know what they call a Jew on a rope?	['jew', 'jew']
Stan	23	0	Alright Cartman, stop ripping on other people to make yourself less embarrassed about the fact that we're all here because of you!	[]
Cartman	17	0	Hey whoa, we are here because the average score was low. That's about all of us.	[]
Stan	22	0	Because of you! It's your fault that we have to do this! We have to do this because you're unhealthy!	[]
Craig	8	1	Yeah. We're paying for your being fat.	['fat']
Cartman	41	2	Wow, Craig. I can't believe you just went there. Here we were having a perfectly nice conversation about Kenny being poor and Kyle being a Jew, and you just decided to go 9/11 and bust out the fat quip.	['jew', 'fat']
Wendy	13	0	We ARE here because of you, Eric, so just keep your mouth shut!	[]
Cartman	24	0	Oh my God! Why doesn't everyone just back off?! I know how this works: You're the 99% ganging up on the 1%!	[]
Clyde	3	0	Oh grow up.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Jesus Christ!! The 99% is totally ganging up on me!	[]
Stan	13	0	That's what we mean by grow up dude! Stop being a baby!	[]
Craig	14	0	Yeah, why don't you go home and cry to your stuffed animals again?!	[]
Cartman	23	0	Ngh, and then, and then Wendy said that they were the 99% and I was the 1% and that made me not keeeewl.	[]
Clyde Frog	5	0	But Eric, you are cool.	[]
Cartman	14	0	I know, Clyde Frog, but now the 99% is saying everything is my faaault.	[]
Peter Panda	19	0	It's not your fault, Eric. How can they blame you for what is clearly President Obama's fault?	[]
Cartman	6	0	What do you mean, Peter Panda?	[]
Peter Panda	11	0	You didn't make that stupid Presidential Fitness Test. Obama did.	[]
Polly Prissypants	17	0	Yeah, that's right Eric. You don't need to grow up. You are awesome and keeewl.	[]
Cartman	23	0	Thanks Polly Prissypants. I'm just so scared that all the kids at school are gonna be talkin' about me behind my back.	[]
Butters	20	0	Ehe, and so then, Skeletor told Terminator he wanted a divorce, and apparently it's all gonna be finalized soon.	[]
Stan	23	0	Dude, Butters, how many times do we have to go over this? That's not Skeletor, that's a woman named Maria Shriver.	[]
Butters	10	0	Uh but, then, why does his face look like that?	[]
Cartman	97	0	What? What?! WHAT?! What are you guys talking about? What are you guys doin'-What are you talking about? I knew it! You guys are having a big 99% rally, aren't you?! Occupying the cafeteria?! You wanna know why you guys are all here protesting?! Because you're pissed off, but you actually think it's wrong to be pissed off at a black president, so you're all just pissed off at ME! Well go ahead! Have your little rally to figure out how to stick it to the 1%! See what it gets you!	[]
Butters	13	0	Hey, you know? Eric is right. Maybe we should form a 99% club.	[]
Jimmy	22	0	Yeah. It's not a bad idea. If all the students unite, we can work together to fight the f-f-fit.	[]
Fifth Grader	19	1	Yeah. The fifth graders agree. We're all being punished for one lazy bitch. Let's make him suffer.	['bitch']
Jimmy	12	0	All we need is some good old-fashioned di... di... di... diplomacy.	[]
Jimmy	15	0	Hello sir, we are here on behalf of all fourth graders at South Park Elementary.	[]
Board Rep	13	1	Aahh yes, the Fatty Boombalatty class. How's the extra PE treating you?	['fatty']
Butters	17	0	Sir, we believe your fitness system is flawed, and that for 99% of us, it is unfair.	[]
Board Rep	9	0	What do you want me to do about it?	[]
Jimmy	22	0	Well, sir, we believe that the 1% should be dropped from the fitness results, so that our scores can be more accurate.	[]
Board Rep	56	1	'Fraid that's impossible. The National Fitness Test has very specific standards. No one child can ever be made to feel singled out. We don't even like to use the term physically fit anymore because it can make a student feel unphysically fit, and then that student might end up feeling like a total retard.	['retard']
Jimmy	9	0	...Excuse me, can you use a different terminology please?	[]
Board Rep	14	1	A-and then that fourth grader might end up feeling like a total retard.	['retard']
Butters	11	0	Sir, all of the students already know who the 1% is.	[]
Jimmy	19	0	All you're doing is making the other 99% more angry. I warn you: this could turn very ugly.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Mom, have you been here all day?!	[]
Liane	10	0	No, sweetie, I've been at the hair salon. Why?	[]
Cartman	13	1	Somebody's been in my room!  Fucking 99%ers! What did they take?!	['fucking']
Liane	4	0	Are you sure, sweetie?	[]
Cartman	7	0	Am I sure?? Look at this place!	[]
Liane	6	0	But who would want to s-	[]
Cartman	44	0	Don't you get it Mom?! People voted for Obama, so now that everything sucks they have to blame me!  They didn't take my Stormtrooper watch...  My Arkham City game is still here... what else could they have-   Oh my God.  Clyde Frog!	[]
Liane	1	0	What?	[]
Cartman	8	0	No.  NOOO!  CLYDE FROG!!  They took Clyde Frog!	[]
Cartman	8	0	Clyde Frog! Clyde!? Clyde Frog?!  Clyde. CLYDE FROG!	[]
Cartman	148	1	I've known Clyde Frog since I was two years old. He was a fighter, a visionary. But most of all, Clyde Frog was the perfect friend. He never said anything. He never had his own ideas about what he wanted to do. He just sat there goin' along with whatever I wanted. A noble trait that seems lost on you 99%ers.  And now we live in a world where one of you has decided to become a murderer. Well whoever you are, I'm sure you're sitting there right now, in your little green hat, with your left cheek resting against your hand thinking, I'm not getting away with this, am I? Because whoever you are, maybe you still have one little piece of humanity left, covered up and tainted black by years of Jewish propaganda and left-wing lies. Maybe you should just-	['jewish']
Kyle	5	1	Shut the hell up, Cartman!	['hell']
Cartman	5	0	Got something to say Kyle?!	[]
Kyle	7	0	How do you murder a stuffed animal?!	[]
Cartman	58	0	How do you murder a stuffed animal?! You tell us, Kyle!  Butbut but but, but uh but let's not get ahead of ourselves. There's still a biiig investigation to come. And until we prove beyond a reasonable doubt who the killer was, you are all just as guilty as Kyle. Thank you so much. Bagpipes please.	[]
Cartman	17	0	Fly, fly little dove, to the welcome arms of Christ above. Your tears are finally gone to-	[]
Craig	5	0	Where's our five dollars?	[]
Cartman	3	0	Fly bu-what?	[]
Craig	14	0	It said in the e-mail if we came we each got five dollars.	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Cartman	18	0	Five dollars has been donated in each of your names to the Clyde Frog Foundation. Fly fly fly...	[]
Class	1	0	AWWW!	[]
Kid 1	2	0	Come on!	[]
Kid 2	2	0	Screw this.	[]
Kid 4	4	0	Hurry up, screw this.	[]
Cartman	27	2	Oh fine, go on and leave! I'm gonna find out who did this to Clyde, and I'm gonna have your fuckin' balls! Fly to Christ.	['fuckin', 'balls']
Receptionist	13	0	Sir? Sir, do you remember the kids from that South Park Elementary School?	[]
Board Rep	9	0	Oh yes, the Boom Boom Chubby Choom Choom school.	[]
Receptionist	16	0	They're all protesting outside, saying our system isn't fair to the 99% of them.	[]
Board Rep	8	0	Oh my Jesus! Oh, not a 99% rally.	[]
Butters	5	0	I sure hope this works.	[]
Field Reporter 1	55	0	Tom, I'm reporting from the middle of a protest where two fourth grade students are fed up, and have decided to occupy Red Robin. Occupy Red Robin has been going on for several hours now, and boys, technically I am part of the 99% so, what do I have to say about all this?	[]
Cartman	26	0	Thank you all so much for coming. I realize that Clyde Frog's death is as shocking to all of you as it is to me.	[]
Peter Panda	8	0	Why would somebody do such a terrible thing?	[]
Polly Prissypants	15	0	Why would somebody hurt Clyde Frog, Eric? Especially because you are so awesome and keewl.	[]
Cartman	23	0	I know that I'm awesome and keewl, Polly Prissypants, but it has little relevance at the moment to Clyde Frog's murder!	[]
Rumpertumskin	13	0	Let's stop the charades, Eric, and let's get down to business.	[]
Cartman	5	0	What do you mean, Rumpertumskin?	[]
Rumpertumskin	24	3	We all know who fuckin' killed Clyde Frog, and she's the same dirty slut who's been fucking with us our whole lives!	['fuckin', 'slut', 'fucking']
Liane	5	0	Eric, sweetie, is everything okay?	[]
Polly Prissypants	4	0	Does everything look okay?	[]
Peter Panda	5	2	Sit down, you fucking bitch.	['fucking', 'bitch']
Cartman	11	0	Yes, sit down, mother. We are all having a tea party.	[]
Liane	16	0	Uh sweetie, I see that you're a little... disturbed right now, but, maybe you can-	[]
Polly Prissypants	5	2	Shut your fat piehole, bitch!	['fat', 'bitch']
Rumpertumskin	13	0	Yeah! You know what you did, skank! You let Clyde Frog get murdered!	[]
Liane	7	0	No, Rumpertumskin, I didn't. I swear.	[]
Muscleman Marc	22	0	Then why did you write in your diary It was probably time for Eric to grow out of his stuffed animals anyway?!	[]
Cartman	9	0	That's an excellent point, Muscleman Marc. Please continue.	[]
Muscleman Marc	8	0	Well, all I'm saying, Eric, is that-	[]
Liane	10	0	Sweetie, you really can just talk to me if you-	[]
Muscleman Marc	17	0	ALL I'M SAYING, ERIC, is that you went through your mom's diary for a reason!	[]
Liane	38	0	Eric, I promise you, I didn't do anything to your favorite toy. Whoever did this to you, I hate them as much as you do, and I'd do anything to get to the bottom of it.	[]
Cartman	11	0	So then, we are all going to need some... more tea.	[]
Sgt. Yates	48	0	You'd better give me every cop you've got on the South Side! I don't care where ABC parks their truck, as long as it doesn't block the fire trucks!  Jesus, this protest is getting out of hand! Alright, what exactly are we dealing with?	[]
Officer 1	44	0	It's no good. The protest has quadrupled in size since this morning. As you can see from this aerial photograph, the protest covers almost two square miles. We have right officers here, here, and here. The media has been contained in this area.	[]
Sgt. Yates	6	0	And where are the actual protesters?	[]
Officer 1	6	0	Oh, these two people right here.	[]
Sgt. Yates	7	0	How are we gonna contain this ting?!	[]
Officer 2	26	0	I'm afraid it's about to get worse. You see this area here? This is where we're setting up the stage for Bon Jovi.	[]
Sgt. Yates	2	0	Bon Jovi?	[]
Officer 2	35	0	These are good cops! We can't have them standing around for hours without some entertainment! The problem is, with this area blocked by napping tents, we have no place to serve the officers beer.	[]
Sgt. Yates	16	1	Damnit! Don't these protesters know what this is all heading towards?  Full-on class warfare.	['damnit']
Cartman	11	1	What the hell?!  Mom? Mom, my room is...  AAAH!! PETER PANDA!!	['hell']
Fireman 1	14	0	The fire started with this. Definitely a case of arson. Somebody hates this kid.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Don't you touch him! Leave him alone!  Peter Panda!	[]
Peter Panda	2	0	Eh, Eric.	[]
Cartman	12	0	Don't try to talk, Peter Panda! You're gonna be okay!	[]
Peter Panda	4	0	Eric... Remember...  Stay... keeewl.	[]
Fireman 2	9	0	Sorry kid, we need to take this as evidence.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Noohoho! Peter Panda nooo!	[]
Female Reporter	38	0	The 99%ers movement continues to grow as more and more Americans occupy Red Robin. I asked some of the people exactly what they hoped to accomplish.  And sir, what do you hope to accomplish by this movement?	[]
Patron	14	0	I like the uh, A1 Peppercorn Burger. And they got ummm, bo-bottomless fries.	[]
Female Reporter	20	0	And as the protesters inside Red Robin unite together, word is that filmmaker Michael Moore has joined the protesters outside.	[]
Michael Moore	20	0	I look at the faces of you protesters and I see the future of America! We are the 99%! YESSS!!	[]
Kyle	13	0	Hey dude, ah are you the guys messing with Cartman's stuffed animals?	[]
Fifth Grader	12	0	Maybe we are and maybe we aren't. You got any proof?	[]
Stan	14	0	Well, just... you and your friends were the ones saying Cartman needs to suffer?	[]
Fifth Grader	17	2	That doesn't prove anything. That fat little fuck is finally getting what's coming to him.	['fat', 'fuck']
Kyle	11	0	Yeah, but dude, he seriously could have died in that fire.	[]
Fifth Grader	36	0	He's in your class but you don't deal with him! So we are gonna remedy the situation! We've got big plans! Just stay out of our way and let the men handle this!	[]
Liane	12	0	Thank you so much for allowing Eric and I to stay here.	[]
Bob	15	0	Of course. You can't be staying in a home with that much fire damage.	[]
Linda	28	0	To be honest, we're just a little surprised your son begged you to stay with us. We never knew your son and our son were so close.	[]
Liane	16	0	I asked little Eric where he would feel safest, and he said with his friend Token.	[]
Cartman	46	1	This window locks from the inside, right? And this door has a lock on it too? Don't worry Polly Prissypants, you're gonna be safe here. In this day and age, black people are just impervious to being fucked with, so we will be alright.	['fucked']
Token	7	0	Why are you involving me in this?	[]
Cartman	24	0	Token, please. You're the only person I can trust. Because in today's time, black people are somehow incapable of doing something wrong.	[]
Field Reporter 2	38	0	Breaking news from the Occupy Red Robin movement. The protesters have decreased in number from two to one, as one of the protesters has apparently splintered off from the group to start a new movement: Occupy the Restroom.	[]
Field Reporter 1	66	0	Tom, Occupy the Restroom has been going on for almost thirty minutes now. Certainly a sign that this country is more divided than ever. These 99%ers are fed up,  and as a result you can clearly see this restroom is OCCUPIED.  Uh, Tom, it looks like the movement is finished, but from the time it took, it must have been a pretty decent-sized movement.	[]
Token	9	0	Will you stop changing channels and just pick something?	[]
Cartman	7	0	What do you wanna watch, Polly Prissypants?	[]
Token	11	0	This is my room! I'll take the remote from you!	[]
Cartman	15	0	Muh uh, 'cause I'll tell my mom on you when our parents get home.	[]
Token	11	0	You're a guest here! Your mom isn't in charge!	[]
Cartman	22	0	Naw uh, 'cause my house got burned down, so everyone has to feel bad for me.  What is that? WHAT IS THAT?!	[]
Token	10	0	That's the alarm; someone's in the back yard.	[]
Cartman	2	0	What?! Who?!	[]
Token	4	0	I don't know.	[]
Cartman	14	0	I thought I was safe here! Stay there guys, I'll be right back!	[]
Cartman	13	0	Who's there?!  Lock that door behind you, Token.  Black people live here!	[]
Token	3	0	A motion detector.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Aha! I knew it was you, Kyle!	[]
Kyle	11	0	It's not me! I'm here to help you, fatass!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Oh sure!	[]
Stan	21	0	Stop it, Cartman! It's true! We came to keep an eye out. Stephen Tamil said he had something big planned.	[]
Cartman	21	1	Stephen Tamil? The fifth grader?  Oh shit!  I told you to lock that door, Token!  No.  Nononono!  Where are they Kenny??!!	['shit']
Kenny	5	0	(I don't really know!)	[]
Cartman	1	0	HAAAAGH!	[]
Stan	8	1	Hey! Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!	['hell']
Cartman	14	2	I don't trust any of you assholes!  Where are you sons of bitches?!	['assholes', 'bitches']
Stephen Tamil	4	0	Alright guys. You ready?	[]
Classmates	1	0	Ready!	[]
Stephen Tamil	3	0	Here we GO!	[]
Butters	7	0	Hey, what are you fifth graders doing?	[]
Stephen Tamil	28	0	We are the 83%! We are tired of being punished for the fourth grade class! The fourth grade is stickin' it to the other 83% of the school!	[]
Jimmy	17	0	Now hold on a second, fellas. If you're the 83%, then our class is only 17%.	[]
Butters	11	0	Yeah, how can the 17% be sticking it to the 83%?	[]
Stephen Tamil	12	0	Because your class had Cartman in it, and he's the 1%!	[]
Jimmy	11	0	But if he's 1% of 17%, then he's .17%.	[]
Field Reporter 3	17	0	This is it. The inevitable has happened at Occupy Red Robin. It is full-on class warfare.	[]
Female Reporter 2	19	0	And now class warfare is breaking out. Apparently it is the fourth grade class versus the fifth grade class.	[]
Sgt. Yates	9	0	It's here! The class warfare is finally here!	[]
Officer 2	1	0	Yeeah!	[]
Cartman	15	0	Hello??  Whoever you are, just give them back! Haven't you done enough to me?!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Muscleman Marc! AAAAAAAA!! AAAAAAAA!!	[]
Cartman	5	0	Polly Prissypants! Rumpertumskin!  Jesus Christ!	[]
Rumpertumskin	6	0	Eric! Don't come any closer!	[]
Cartman	5	0	Who did this to you?!	[]
Rumpertumskin	10	0	You said you wouldn't let anything happen to us.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Don't worry, I'll get you down!	[]
Rumpertumskin	6	0	No Eric, don't come any-	[]
Cartman	11	0	AAAAHAA! AAHAAAA! Rumpertumskin!! RUMPER  Rumpertumskin... WHY? Why did you do this??	[]
Polly Prissypants	8	0	It's okay, Eric. It's over now.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Polly... Polly Prissypants... You did this?	[]
Polly Prissypants	19	0	Don't you see? The kids at school were right, Eric. It was time for us to grow up.	[]
Cartman	10	0	...You got rid of Clyde Frog... You burned Peter Panda!	[]
Polly Prissypants	13	0	Yes, they're gone. And now we can grow up and be together.	[]
Cartman	4	0	They were your FRIENDS!	[]
Polly Prissypants	33	0	They were holding us back! All the kids making fun of you at school, saying you're not keewl! Your stuffed animals all have to be gotten rid of, don't you see?!	[]
Bob	7	0	Dead-bolted. Token!  Token, you in there?!	[]
Cartman	17	0	Polly Prissypants, when people find out we did all this, we're gonna get in total trouble!	[]
Polly Prissypants	31	0	No, I thought of everything! It all happened here so that everyone would think Token did it. All the blame will be on him. And we can live happily ever after.	[]
Cartman	50	0	There's one problem.  You say I have to grow up, to get rid of all my dolls. You forget one crucial thing, Polly Prissypants. That nobody would possibly blame Token for all this because in today's day and age you can't blame a black person for anything.	[]
Polly Prissypants	31	0	Oh no! You're totally right! But I thought my plan was perfect! I failed! I failed you! You have to kill me Eric! So that you don't get blamed!	[]
Cartman	13	0	Noho! I've lost every stuffed animal; I won't lose you too!	[]
Polly Prissypants	30	0	It's the only way Eric. You have to do it. Please! I can't live with myself after what I've done. Please, you have to do it Eric.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Goodbye, Polly Prissypants. I love you.	[]
Polly Prissypants	7	0	Say hello to the sunrise for me.	[]
Stan	4	1	Dude, what the hell?	['hell']
Kyle	14	0	We told him to grow up. So he got rid of his stuffed animals.	[]
Liane	9	0	My little Eric can sometimes be a bit... dramatic.	[]
Field Reporter 3	43	0	Occupy Red Robin is over. Class warfare has torn apart the 99% and replaced it with the 30%, the 26%, and even little brackets of 5%s here and there. What does this mean for our country? What oes this mean... for me?	[]
Officer 2	11	0	Hey! Get down to State Street! They're occupying Macaroni Grill!	[]
Field Reporter 3	12	1	Oh hell yeah! I'll occupy me some goat-cheese peppadew peppers!	['hell']
