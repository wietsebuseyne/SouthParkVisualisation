Cartman	38	1	Hey, you guys, you wanna know what my favorite psalm is? It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's separation.  This sort of penetration will increase the population of the younger generation.	['boneration']
Mr. Mackey	53	0	God is in the midst of her, m'kay. She shall not be moved, m'kay.  Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, m'kay, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof, m'kay. There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place-	[]

Priest Maxi	96	3	Thank you, Mr. Mackey. Hello, everyone. Today, we're going to talk about hell.  Hell is not a very nice place. Burning, searing, flames. Screaming, torture. For eternity. Once you are in hell, you cannot escape. You live forever in horrible pain, in burning agony. All sinners are there in misery, dying over and over and over.  If you be cast down into this black bog of stench, then woe is thou,  for Satan has made it the most miserable place in the universe!  And he will be your ruler!  Your ruler of pain and agony!

Nun	21	0	Hello, children. I'm Sister Anne. And I'll be teaching you so that you can all receive your First Communion.	[]
Stan	6	1	Are we gonna go to hell?	['hell']
Sister Anne	13	0	Well, hopefully not. That's why you're gonna need to receive Communion.	[]
Cartman	13	0	A- And as long as we get this Communion thing, we're safe?	[]
Stan	14	0	What if we haven't really done anything that horribly bad in our lives.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Yeah, what if we haven't?	[]
Sister Anne	40	0	It doesn't matter, because we are all born with Original Sin. Now, let me explain how Communion works.  The priest will give you this round cracker,  and he will say, The Body of Christ, and then you eat it.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Jesus was made of crackers?	[]
Sister Anne	1	0	No.	[]
Stan	5	0	But crackers are his- body.	[]
Sister Anne	1	0	Yes.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(What?!)	[]
Sister Anne	17	0	In the Book of Mark, Jesus distributed bread and said, eat this, for it is my body.	[]
Cartman	13	1	So wwe won't go to hell as long as we eat crackers.	['hell']
Sister Anne	1	0	Nononono!	[]
Butters	6	0	Uhwell, uhwhat are we eatin' then?	[]
Sister Anne	4	0	The Body of Christ!	[]
Stan	32	0	Nonono, I get it. Jesus wanted us to eat him, but he didn't want us to be cannibals, so he turned himself into crackers, and then told people to eat him.	[]
Sister Anne	1	0	No!	[]
Stan	1	0	No??	[]
Butters	11	0	Huh-I can't whistle if I eat too many crackers.	[]
Sister Anne	19	0	Look: all you have to know is that when the priest gives you the cracker, you eat it! Okay?!	[]
"Kenny, Stan, Cartman"	2	0	O-kay.	[]
Sister Anne	18	0	And then, you will drink a very small amount of wine, for that, is the Blood of Christ.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Aw, come on now, this is just getting silly!	[]
Sister Anne	7	1	Eric, do you wanna go to hell?!	['hell']
Cartman	1	0	Nno!	[]
Sister Anne	4	0	Then stop questioning me.	[]
Cartman	12	1	But now we can have Communion and not go to hell, right?	['hell']
Sister Anne	16	0	No. Because before you can take your first Communion, you have to have your first Confession.	[]
Stan	1	0	Confession?	[]
Sister Anne	61	0	You'll be getting in the Confession box with a priest and confessing all your sins, so that God can forgive you. You kids will all have to go to your first Confession this Tuesday, so I want you all to go home tonight and think long and hard about all your sins, so that you can tell the priest everything.	[]
Kenny	2	1	(OH, SHIT!)	['shit']
Chris	7	0	Those were some great pork chops, Satan.	[]

Satan	2	0	Nothing. Why?	[]
Chris	15	0	Well, it's... just that you've washed that same dish seven times now, silly.	[]
Satan	5	0	Oh, huh. Sorry, huh-huh.	[]
Chris	13	0	Come on, Satan. You know you can tell me anything. What's up?	[]
Satan	6	0	Well, Chris, Saddam showed up today.	[]
Chris	8	0	Oh.  Woww!  I wasn't ready for that.	[]
Satan	18	0	He showed up spouting all kinds of things about how he's changed and he still loves me...	[]
Chris	5	0	I thought you... killed him.	[]
Satan	8	0	Yeah, well, where was he gonna go? Detroit?	[]
Chris	5	0	...Do you still love him?	[]
Satan	2	0	No, Chris.	[]
Chris	6	0	It's okay of you do.	[]
Satan	31	0	Well, I mean-  Of course, there's a part of me that will always love him, I... But I also know how abusive he was-I'm much happier with you.	[]
Chris	21	0	Well, you know what I think we should do? I think we should all get together and just talk, like adults.	[]
Satan	1	0	What?	[]
Chris	14	0	We're all grown men here, Satan. I wanna just go meet this guy.	[]
Satan	10	1	No, Chris, you don't understand. Saddam is fucking crazy.	['fucking']
Chris	34	0	Oh, I know he's got the whole bad-boy thing going. But I think that's what you were attracted to. But I can be a pretty rough tumbler myself.  Oops!  Aw, butternuts!	[]
Stan	29	0	Okay, let's see. Uuh, oh yeah, there was the time we threw a fish into the busdriver's hair and she didn't find it for seven days.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Oh yeah, okay.	[]
Stan	20	1	And thennn there was the time we held that little first-grader down and farted on him for 28 minutes.	['farted']
Cartman	6	0	Right, I already got that one.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Hey, dudes. What are you doin'?	[]
Stan	27	1	We're trying to remember all our sins. Sister Anne told us we have to confess all our sins or else we're gonna go to hell.	['hell']
Kyle	1	0	Uhwuwhat?	[]
Stan	7	0	Have you confessed all your sins yet?	[]
Kyle	5	0	No-o-o-o-o!	[]

Kyle	5	0	Oh good. I don't?	[]
Cartman	7	1	No, you're already going to hell.	['hell']
Kyle	3	0	I am not!	[]
Cartman	3	0	You are, too!	[]
Stan	28	1	Dude, this lady told us if you don't confess all your sins and you don't eat crackers and drink wine, then you go to hell. Period.	['hell']
Kyle	7	0	I'm gonna go ask my mom!	[]
Stan	16	0	Now, let's see. What about the time we set Mr. Garrison's cat on fire?	[]
Cartman	7	0	Alright. That was mostly Kenny's fault.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(What?)	[]
Butters	10	0	Eyou guys! Eyou guys! Uh we just thought of somethin'!	[]
Stan	2	0	What, Butters?	[]
Butters	9	0	Uhwell, uh what about the handicapped kid, uh-Timmy?	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmiih!	[]
Cartman	6	0	What'd we do to Timmy?	[]
Butters	24	1	No! I mean, poor Timmy's gonna go to hell! He can't confess his sins, 'cause all he can say is his name!	['hell']
Timmy	1	0	Timmiih!	[]
Cartman	11	0	Oh yeah, you're right. I guess Timmy's pretty screwed.	[]
Stan	15	1	Oh man, we can't let Timmy go to hell. We have to do something.	['hell']
Kenny	5	0	(What are we gonna do?)	[]
Stan	13	0	I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna do.	[]
Satan	102	0	I don't know what I'm gonna do. I can't deny my feelings for Saddam, but... my life is so much better now with Chris.  Yeah. It's like Chris is so perfect in every way, but there's just something about Saddam that I'm more attracted to.  In what way?  Yeah, you're right. Saddam would just treat me bad again. I'm just gonna have to not see Saddam. Put him out of my mind and focus on Chris. If I don't see Saddam, then I won't have such strong feelings for him. Thanks guys.	[]
Chris	3	0	There you are.	[]
Satan	3	0	Oh hi, Chris!	[]
Chris	21	0	I've been lookin' all over for you. I have to tell you somethin' that might make you... a little mad.	[]
Satan	1	0	What?	[]
Chris	12	0	Well, I called Saddam Hussein and invited him over for dinner tonight.	[]
Satan	2	0	You WHAT?!	[]
Chris	13	0	I just think we all need to get this out in the open.	[]
Satan	4	0	Oh, Chris! Rraarr!  Rraahh!	[]
Chris	46	0	Come on, Satan. We're all adults here. He was an important person in your life, for better or for worse. So, I wanna know him. If he sees that I'ma real person too, then... well, maybe he'll see how happy we are together.	[]
Satan	13	0	No, Chris! He'll try to kill you is what he'll do!	[]
Chris	9	0	Satan, we're not in junior high school anymore.	[]
Satan	3	0	Oh, dear God.	[]
Stan	15	0	Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art though amongst wo-	[]
Cartman	3	0	How was it?	[]
Stan	7	0	Uh- Aw, dude, you screwed me up!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Huh?	[]
Stan	25	0	The guy in there said I have to say 54 Hail Marys. Now I can't remember if I was on number seven or eight.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Who's in there?	[]
Stan	15	0	I don't know. You can't see him; it's just some anonymous guy.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Well, here goes everything.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.	[]
Priest Maxi	11	0	Blessed art thou, child. Now, what do you have to confess?	[]
Cartman	39	0	Well, let's see. I'd like to start, if I may, back when I was two and a half. It was a cold April morning, and the dew on the grass was frozen, like tiny beads of glass...	[]
Stan	11	0	...Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Ble-	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Hey, dude.)	[]
Stan	2	1	God damnit!	['damnit']
Kenny	1	0	(What??)	[]
Stan	17	0	Oh, there's Sister Anne! Come on, we've got to ask her about Timmy.  Sister Anne?	[]
Sister Anne	3	0	Oh, hello, children.	[]
Stan	4	0	We have a question.	[]
Sister Anne	2	0	Okay, shoot.	[]
Stan	8	0	Where do handicapped people go when they die?	[]
Sister Anne	25	0	The handicapped are just people like you and me, so the same rules apply. They need to be baptized, take Communion, and confess their sins.	[]
Stan	33	1	But our friend Timmy can't really talk. All he can do is say his own name, so he can't really confess his sins. So is he goin' to go to hell?	['hell']
Sister Anne	23	0	Uugh. This really isn't a question for me, it's for the priest.  I'll see if I can find him. Bye.	[]
Cartman	21	0	And that was about everything from first grade. Then last year, well, you can't tell anybody about this stuff, right?	[]
Priest Maxi	8	0	Your  con- confession does not leave this box.	[]
Cartman	17	0	Okay, because, last year, I took a sandwich that the priest of this church had been eating.	[]
Priest Maxi	14	0	Oh. Well, Uh arr-I'm sure he would forgive you if he knew.	[]
Cartman	41	1	No, but I'm not finished yet. I took the sandwich that the priest was eating, took the piece of ham out of it, put it between my butt cheeks, and then put the sandwich back and watched him eat it.	['butt']
Priest Maxi	2	0	I... see.	[]
Cartman	121	1	Yeah, and then this other time, I went pee-pee in the holy water thing, and the priest blessed himself on the forehead with it every day for about a week.  And then this one time, I was at the park, and the priest was out walking his dog and I went-... number two on the sidewalk and then told Officer Barbrady that it was the priest's dog.  And so the priest got find like a hundred dollars for not cleaning it up. And then this one time, I put super glue all over the priest's bottle of-  -eh- Ow!  D'ow! Jesus! Ooww-ah! Ow!  Eh! Oh! Help.  Oh! Somebody help! God damnit! Let me out of here!	['damnit']
Sister Anne	15	0	Father! I need to talk to you. Father!  I have to ask you a question.	[]
Priest Maxi	2	0	Okayokay, fine!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Uh-huh-  Oho! Ohoho.	[]
Stan	2	0	What happened??	[]
Cartman	28	0	I felt it, you guys. I felt the angry hands of God.  He is an angry God, you guys. We all have to start taking this very seriously.	[]
Chris	7	0	Oh, hello. You must be Saddam Hussein.	[]
Saddam	25	1	And you must be Mr. Assface.  Just kidding. You're Chris, right? Thanks for inviting me to dinner, guy.  Here, I brought you a potato.	['assface']

Sheila	6	0	Why? What did you do, Kyle?!	[]
Kyle	21	1	Nothing. But the guys said if I don't confess my sins and eat crackers, I'm gonna go to hell.	['hell']
Sheila	13	2	Oh noooo, that's just Catholics. Us Jews don't believe in hell.	['jews', 'hell']
Kyle	9	0	We don't? But what if we're wrong?	[]
Sheila	7	0	Well..., Kyle..., they could be wrong, too.	[]
Kyle	17	1	Yeah, but if they're wrong, no big deal. If we're wrong, we burn in hell.	['hell']
Ike	2	0	Oh, no.	[]
Gerald	54	1	Kyle, it's all about being a good person now! You see, Christians use hell as a way to scare people into believing what they believe. But to believe in something just because you're afraid of the consequences if you don't believe in something is no reason to believe in something. Understand?	['hell']
Ike	3	0	No-o-o.	[]
Kyle	29	0	Well, you guys can do what you want! I'm going down to that church to confess my sins and eat crackers! And I'm taking Ike with me!	[]
Sheila	1	0	Kyle!	[]
Chris	16	0	So Saddam. Satan told me all about how you guys almost took over the world once.	[]
Saddam	17	2	Hn-yeah, those were the days, boy. What the hell is this crap we're eating, anyway?	['hell', 'crap']
Satan	12	0	It's all vegetarian, Saddam. Chris was a nutritionist before he died.	[]
Saddam	15	0	Oh, isn't that fascinating. So, tell me, Chris. How is it that you died?	[]
Chris	18	0	Oh, well I, I actually slipped down an escalator, in a mall. Those things can be pretty sketchy.	[]
Saddam	11	1	An escalator? What kind of pussy way of dying is that?!	['pussy']
Chris	29	0	L-look, Saddam, I know that you and Satan had a relationship  And I just want you to know  that I'm totally okay with you guys staying friends.	[]
Saddam	2	0	Uh huh.	[]
Chris	33	0	I think it's important to stay friends with people you've had relationships with.  And I know that Satan and my relationship is strong enough that it can handle anything.  Right?  Right.	[]
Sister Anne	18	0	Father, the children asked me about their handicapped friend. I wanna explain to them that he's fine.	[]
Priest Maxi	9	0	Well, has your friend ever confessed or been baptized?	[]
Stan	5	0	I don't think so.	[]
Priest Maxi	4	1	Then, hell awaits him.	['hell']
Sister Anne	12	0	Father, these boys are really worried because they think they have to-	[]
Priest Maxi	17	0	They SHOULD be worried! Boys, it is your Christian duty to save the souls of your friends!	[]
Sister Anne	2	0	Yes, but-	[]
Kyle	8	0	Mister Father!  We have to ask you something.	[]
Priest Maxi	8	1	Oh. You're the little Jewish boy, right?	['jewish']
Kyle	11	2	Yeah. If we're Jewish, are we gonna go to hell?	['jewish', 'hell']
Priest Maxi	53	1	Well, young man, you can rest assured that according to Matthew 25, when you die you will stand before God and he will will say, Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. Yes! As a Jew, your home will be the lake of fire.	['jew']

"Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Kenny"	3	0	We will be.	[]
Sister Anne	29	1	Father, I don't know if I agree fully with what you're saying. I think that as long as Jewish people are good, they will get into heaven.	['jewish']
Priest Maxi	29	4	Sister, the Jews crucified our Savior. I mean, if you don't go to hell for crucifying the Savior, then what the hell do you go to hell for?!	['jews', 'hell', 'hell', 'hell']
