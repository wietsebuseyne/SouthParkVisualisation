Cartman	76	1	Another morning. Waiting for the run-down school bus to take me to the run-down school. But today is the day I finally have the guts to do what I should've done a long time ago.  Nobody notices what I have in my front pocket. A little surprise for them all.  I'm prepared for this, but still I wonder.. Will I have the guts to go through with it? Damn right I will!	['damn']
Kyle	4	0	Are you okay, Cartman?	[]
Cartman	53	0	Yeah I'm good. How are you, Kyle?  They're all gonna pay! Every day they pushed me and pushed, and if it happens again today, it's going to be the last time.  We'll find out today at recess, won't we? Oh yes, we'll find out today at recess.	[]
Butters	8	0	Hey Eric! I'm not suspended no more.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Good for you.	[]
Butters	6	0	I think someone's in there.	[]
Cartman	10	2	No! God damn it no!  Who's takin' a shit?!	['damn', 'shit']
Craig	1	0	Occupied.	[]
Cartman	10	0	I called dibs on Stall 1 for all recess, Craig!	[]
Craig	8	0	You can't call dibs on a toilet.	[]
Cartman	19	1	Son of a bitch!  Oh no! NO NO NO! I cannot go another lunch break without my toilet time!	['bitch']
Kyle	10	0	Then don't eat 14 Egg waffles for lunch, fatass!	[]
Cartman	26	1	Alright, that does it!  I'm sick of this shit and I'm not gonna be  taking it any longer!  You all pushed me to this!	['shit']
Wendy	9	1	What the hell do you think you're doing?	['hell']
Cartman	6	0	I'm going to the potty.	[]
Wendy	5	0	This is the girls bathroom!	[]
Cartman	11	1	Alright, I need to tell you something, Wendy. I'm transginger.	['transginger']
Wendy	1	0	WHAT?!	[]
Cartman	44	2	Did you notice the bow?  I'm not comfortable with the sex I was assigned at birth, so I'm exercising my right to identify with the gender of my choice. Now get out of my way. I have to take a shit.  Aaahhh!	['sex', 'shit']
Wendy	4	0	GET OUT OF HERE!	[]
Cartman	29	0	Don't give me any more issues than I already have, Wendy!  Oh wow, this is nice in here. The girls bathroom is a lot cleaner than the boys.	[]
Red	5	1	What the hell is that?!	['hell']
Wendy	5	0	Cartman is using our bathroom!	[]
Cartman	15	0	Dude, this is awesome. I should've used the girls bathroom a long time ago.	[]
Red	7	0	Hey! I'm gonna tell on you!	[]
Cartman	16	1	It's okay, Red. I can take a shit here. I'm a dumb chick too.	['shit']
Principal Victoria	18	0	I want to know just what makes you think it's okay to go inside the girls bathroom!	[]
Cartman	16	2	Because I'm transginger. I looked it up: that means I can use the girls shitter.	['transginger', 'shitter']
Principal Victoria	13	0	You are not transgender, Eric! You don't even know what that means!	[]
Cartman	26	0	Yeah uh huh, it means I live a life of torture and confusion because society sees me as a boy but I'm really a girl.	[]
Principal Victoria	20	0	All right, well if you identify yourself as a girl, you must find yourself attracted to boys. Is that right?!	[]
Cartman	26	2	That's actually not true. I can be transginger without it having anything to do with the ginger I'm attracted to. Check the state bylaws.	['transginger', 'ginger']
Principal Victoria	3	0	Alright, listen Eric!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Erica.	[]
Principal Victoria	15	0	Listen Eric! You must know why we can't have you in the girls bathroom!	[]
Cartman	20	2	All I know is I'm transginger, and you can't make me go to the bathroom with the cisgingers.	['transginger', 'cisgingers']
Principal Victoria	3	0	With the what?!	[]
Mr. Garrison	27	1	Cisgender. It's the politically correct name for people who aren't transgender. If you identify with the sex you were born with, then you're cis.	['sex']
Mr. Mackey	7	0	But then cisgender-ed is just normal	[]
Mr. Garrison	29	0	Saying normal is extremely offensive to people who aren't in that group.  Trust me, you don't want this hot potato! Just let him use the girls room!	[]
Principal Victoria	16	0	But this isn't a hurting confused child we're talking about. It's Eric Cartman.	[]
Mr. Garrison	14	0	Nobody else is gonna know that. You better just give him what he wants.	[]
Principal Victoria	12	0	Sooo Eric Cartman just has us in some kind of bathroom checkmate?	[]
Mr. Garrison	8	0	Actually,  it's more like a royal flush.	[]
Reporter	2	0	Gerald Broflovski?	[]
Gerald	1	0	Yes?	[]
Brandon Carlile	33	0	Brandon Carlile, reporter, Spin Magazine. I was hoping you could help me... make sense of somethin'. I understand you had a very large party in your back yard last... last Sunday, was it?	[]
Gerald	16	0	That's right.  My son and his friends throw a party for a kid with diabetes.	[]
Brandon Carlile	16	0	I also understand that a very famous pop artist, Lorde, was the entertainment at that party.	[]
Gerald	8	0	Oh yeah, yeah, the kids were pretty excited.	[]
Brandon Carlile	30	0	Well it, eh, it's just a little curious, you know? Why a hugely popular Top-20 artist would play such a... well no offence, but such a humble venue?	[]
Gerald	8	0	...Sorry, I don't think I get your-	[]
Brandon Carlile	24	0	You understand, we deal with a lot of fake stories at Spin.  Was just wondering how the boys got someone like Lorde to play.	[]
Gerald	17	0	From what I understand, she's the niece of someone's coworker here in town or something.	[]
Brandon Carlile	5	0	You wouldn't know who?	[]
Gerald	5	0	No. Does it really matter?	[]
Brandon Carlile	24	0	Lorde is an incredibly talented and down-to-earth young lady. It would be a shame if someone was... having fun at her expense.	[]
Sharon	4	0	Randy? Whose are these?	[]
Randy	6	0	Aaah I don't know. Why?	[]
Sharon	9	0	Why? Because there's fishnet stockings inside your jeans?	[]
Randy	3	0	In my jeans?	[]
Sharon	8	0	Randy? Do you have something to tell me?	[]
Randy	3	0	...Yeah. I do.	[]
Red	10	0	Come on! You've been in there for twenty minutes!	[]
Sia	5	0	Yeah! Recess is almost over!	[]
Cartman	10	0	There's two more stall in here, gals. Go ahead.	[]
Sia	6	0	Not while you're in here!	[]
Cartman	22	2	Oh my God, you guys are so cisginger. Sorry I'm different, but you can just suck my clit AND my balls.	['cisginger', 'balls']
Wendy	16	0	Eric, there are people actually struggling with their gender identity and all you're doing is-	[]
Cartman	19	1	Okay, okay, okay you guys! You know what? You know what?  That's what.  Suck my clit and balls.	['balls']
Principal Victoria	11	0	Erica, I believe we have a solution to this little problem.	[]
Cartman	13	0	I don't have a problem, Principal Victoria, the cisgenders have the problem.	[]
Principal Victoria	27	0	If it is agreeable to you, Erica, we are going to clear out the janitor's closet and remodel it into a private bathroom just for you!	[]
Cartman	11	0	Excuse me, are you talking about... my own special executive bathroom?	[]
Principal Victoria	6	0	Would that be agreeable to you?	[]
Cartman	3	0	OH MY GOD!	[]
Wendy	4	0	That isn't fair!	[]
Red	5	0	Wendy, just go with it!	[]
Cartman	34	2	Yeah, just go with it, Wendy, cisginger bitch! Of course, being forced into my own isolated will probably be somewhat traumatic for me. I might have to approve certain aspects of this... solitary location.	['cisginger', 'bitch']
Cartman	23	0	Yeah sooo I'm thinking of water feature here, you know. get the sound of running water, yeah kind of Zen it out.	[]
Designer	14	0	Uh huh, well why don't you put the water feature on this side?	[]
Cartman	4	0	Oh on that side?	[]
Designer	25	0	You know, because you've already got AC over here and that leaves this open for some nice big piece of art on this wall.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Oh I like that. That's gonna look nice, yeah.	[]
Randy	31	0	Yeah, listen. I don't know if I can keep doing this. My wife is starting to suspect something. I just had to tell her I like the way fishnets feel.	[]
Record Executive	32	1	I know your wife means a lot to you, Randy,  but you can't leave us hanging. You've got the purest shit out there; it's worth a lot to us.	['shit']
Randy	15	0	You think you're gonna get a good product when I can't even think?!	[]
Record Executive	19	0	How many times have you said I think I've lost it and everything turned out to be okay?	[]
Randy	2	0	Every time?	[]
Record Executive	17	0	Every time. Come on. Get back to work and see. If you get panicked again, call me.	[]
Randy	5	0	Yeah. Yeah I will. Yup.	[]
Ron	5	0	You wanted to see me?	[]
Record Executive	11	0	Sit down, Ron.  Whattaya know about one of our artists, Lorde?	[]
Ron	10	0	Seventeen-year-old girl from New Zealand, great songwriter,  humble.	[]
Record Executive	10	0	Wrong.  She's a 45-year-old man in Colorado.	[]
Ron	1	0	What?	[]
Record Executive	30	0	He writes the songs, sends us the demos, we fudge them, sell them as a brooding 17-year-old girl way ahead of her time, and nobody knows the difference.	[]
Ron	3	1	Huh.  Holy shit.	['shit']
Record Executive	43	0	He makes good stuff. Stuff that sells. But he's getting edgy feet. I want you to keep an eye on him. And if anyone around him seems like they're close to finding out the truth, well... you know what to do.	[]
Randy	21	0	Lorde Lorde Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde I am Lorde. I am L- I am Lorde. I am Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde.	[]
Sharon	1	0	Randy?	[]
Randy	9	0	I, I, thought you were at the grocery store.	[]
Sharon	9	0	I was. Can you help me unload the car?	[]
Randy	20	0	Help me unload the c-car. Help me unload, load the car. Yah yah yah. Unloadin'. Unload yah yah yah.	[]
Sharon	1	0	Randy?	[]
Randy	4	0	Sorry. Sorry, yeah. Coming.	[]
Stan	3	0	What is that?	[]
Butters	7	0	That's Cartman's new transgender bathroom.	[]
Stan	5	0	Cartman's a girl now?	[]
Butters	24	0	He's not a woman, he's not a man, he is something that you'll never understand. But he would die for me.	[]
Cartman	86	0	It it done?! It is all ready?! Alright alright, move aside everybody, move aside please. I gotta go.  Oh! Ahm. This is gonna be so awesome.  Aha! Lock! Privacy. Oh, this is gonna feel so good!  Perfect.  Yeah, you're gonna take it. You're all alone now, toilet. Nobody can hear you scream. Yeah, you're gonna open wide.  You're gonna TAKE your punishment!

Brandon Carlile	2	0	Peter Nelson?	[]
Nelson	1	0	Yes?	[]
Brandon Carlile	15	0	Brandon Carlile, reporter, Spin Magazine. I understand you work at the U.S. Geological Survey?	[]
Nelson	4	0	Yeah, that's right.	[]
Brandon Carlile	15	0	I also understand that you're the uncle of the amazing and talented songwriter, Lorde?	[]
Nelson	14	0	Alright, look, I am not her uncle. I I just work with her, okay?	[]
Brandon Carlile	4	0	Work with her? How?	[]
Nelson	17	0	I like Lorde. Uh she's really nice and really talented. But she lives a double life.	[]
Brandon Carlile	3	0	How's that?	[]
Nelson	18	0	Lorde isn't just a singer, she's also a very talented scientist who specializes in fluvial geomorphology.	[]
Brandon Carlile	2	0	The what?	[]
Nelson	47	0	She just showed up one day at the office and started filling in for a guy who started working part time. She's a good geologist. When her music career took off we thought she'd be gone, but she still shows up. Usually right after lunch.	[]
Clyde	6	0	Hey Cartman. Heard you're transgender.	[]
Cartman	13	1	Yup! You know what Hillary says: You can suck my clit and balls.	['balls']
Red	21	0	Well I know I'm not even gonna get it done. I swear, he gives us too much homework anyway. I-	[]
Wendy	2	0	Hey guys.	[]
Red	1	0	...Wendy?	[]
Wendy	4	0	How's it hanging'?	[]
Craig	1	0	Whoa..	[]
Jenny	1	0	Huh?	[]
Jason	4	0	Whoa, wait, is that?	[]
Butters	2	0	Holy moly!	[]
Cartman	11	1	Hey, what the fuck, dude?! Do you mind? This is occupied!	['fuck']
Wendy	6	0	It's cool. I'll wait.	[]
Cartman	6	1	Dude, this is my fuckin' bathroom!	['fuckin']
Cartman	13	1	I want her suspended, and I want charges brought up for sexual harassment!	['sexual']
Principal Victoria	16	0	I'm sorry Erica, but I spoke with Wendyl this morning and she's not comfortable-	[]
Cartman	6	1	Wendyl?! Fucking Wendyl?! Grow up, Wendy!	['fucking']
Principal Victoria	13	0	You'll just have to share, Eric. Why can't you understand that?	[]
Cartman	11	1	Because I don't want a chick watching me go poo!	['poo']
Principal Victoria	6	0	I thought you were a chick.	[]
Cartman	40	1	No! I identify as a chick, but I'm still a boy. You can't make me share a bathroom with a girl that identifies herself as a fucking dude!  That is MY waterfall, and those are MY Christmas lights!	['fucking']
Cartman	11	0	Dude! You need to put a tighter leash on your dog!	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Cartman	68	1	Do you know your girlfriend's going around tellin' everyone that you're gay?!  Oh yeah! She's got the whole school believin' that she's attracted to girls, but she's dating you! So what does that make you, Stan?! A girl! Stan-an's a gir-rl! You'd better curb your dog, Stan! You'd better curb your dog before people start ripping on you!	['gay']
Randy	8	0	Shelly, that's enough time on your phone.	[]
Shelly	10	0	Leave me alone, Dad! Stop nagging me all the time!	[]
Randy	10	0	You know we're all cutting down on phone time.	[]
Shelly	10	0	Don't limit me! You don't even understand me!	[]
Randy	12	0	Yeah. I don't understand you at all. A lot you know.	[]
Stan	9	0	Uh hey Dad. I need to talk to you.	[]
Randy	5	0	Oh really? About... about what?	[]
Stan	39	2	Dad, is it possible for someone to be one way on the outside but totally different on the inside?  I mean, can someone identify as one sex but be something else but still have it be nothing about sex?	['sex', 'sex']
Randy	6	0	Yes. Yes, Stan. I am Lorde.	[]
Stan	1	0	...What?	[]
Randy	91	0	It started off so simple. There's a guy at work. Hanson. He would use the bathroom and just blow the thing up, you know? Not only that, but he was in there all the time! I finally got fed up and pretended to be a woman. I called myself Lorde. Have you ever been in a woman's bathroom, Stan? It's all clean and there's enough stalls for everyone. It was so freeing. I started singing while I was in there, and then I- started writing things down.	[]
Stan	14	0	Well you said you knew a guy at work who was Lorde's uncle.	[]
Randy	5	0	Yah, that's my cover.	[]
Stan	14	0	The chick that wrote the theme song to the new Hunger Games, is you?	[]
Randy	33	0	Yeah.  The record company messed it all up. It was supposed to go Hunger Games, yah yah yah, yah yah yah! Hunger Games. But they just- do what they want with my songs.	[]
Stan	7	0	Wha-wait, Lorde sounds like a girl.	[]
Randy	61	0	Autotune. Wanna see how I do it?  I come up with all my best stuff in the bathroom at work. I use this program to import the recordings I make on my phone.  Yeah yeah, feeling good on a Wednesday. Sparklinnnnn' thoughts. Givin' me the hope to go ohhhn  Oh! Whoa. What I need now is a little bit of shelter.	[]
Stan	8	0	Dad, Lorde's music is actually really good.	[]
Randy	59	0	Thanks. But it gets even better when I add the drum loops.  Then with the computer I can actually quantize everything.  Backup instruments.  And then finally I use the Autotune.  Sparklin' thoughts, feelin' good on a Wednesday. Givin' me the hope, givin' givin' me the hope to go ohhhn. What I need is a little bit of shelter.  Stan?	[]
Butters	4	0	Hey! Everything okay, Stan?	[]
Stan	7	0	...I don't know where I belong...	[]
Butters	9	0	Just hold it. That's what I do now.	[]
Cartman	9	3	Hey, what the fuck dude?! God fucking damn it!	['fuck', 'fucking', 'damn']
Cartman	11	0	Why don't we just have everyone use the transgender bathroom?!	[]
Principal Victoria	12	0	Stanley, do you have a reason for not using the boys bathroom?	[]
Stan	19	0	I, I just... Two people close to me are having gender identity issues and I'm, I'm confused.	[]
Cartman	15	1	He's cisginger! He's so cis he wears a jockstrap to bed at night!	['cisginger']
Randy	6	0	You wanted to see me, boss?	[]
Boss	6	0	Yes. Please have a seat, Lorde.	[]
Randy	2	0	Hi Carol.	[]
Carol	1	0	Lorde.	[]
Boss	28	0	Lorde, we're all big fans of your music and we think the world of you for staying and working here even after your music career took off.	[]
Randy	8	0	Well, my music and fluvial geomorphology are intertwined.	[]
Boss	46	0	Amazing, yeah. Uh... Lorde... for some time now the females at this office have been pressuring me to... uh... find your own space... to go to the bathroom.  Everyone loves you, but we thought it would be great if you had your very own executive bathroom.	[]
Randy	24	0	I like the women's bathroom. I feel safe there. Being able to use that bathroom is critical to my identity, to my music.	[]
Carol	20	0	My girls are big fans of your music, Lorde, but the women here aren't comfortable sharing a bathroom with	[]
Randy	4	0	With what?  With what?	[]
Announcer	13	0	You are watching E! Entertainment News! That's how low you've sunk.	[]
Anchor	76	0	It's been several days and still there's no sign of the pop singer Lorde. The singer went dark on Twitter claiming severe depression, and stating  I realize now that I make people uncomfortable. I need to give this up and go back to just being the old me. Spin Magazine is claiming they know the reason for the sudden exit, and will be releasing a tell-all article about the troubled artist next week.	[]
Cartman	18	2	Oh, here he comes, everyone! It's the cisginger! Think you can harass transgingers and use their bathroom?!	['cisginger', 'transgingers']
Butters	9	0	Yeah, what's the big idea harassing Erica, Stan?!	[]
Cartman	35	1	At this school, it doesn't matter if you're trans or you're cis, right guys?!  What we have a problem with are cisgingers who are intolerant! You know what we call those? Cissies!	['cisgingers']
Butters	8	1	Yeah! Stan's a big old fat cissy!	['fat']
Clyde	7	0	Awe, come on, lay off him guys.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Oh, what are you?! A cissy too, Clyde?!	[]
Clyde	5	0	No, no, just he is.	[]
Sharon	8	0	You just gonna drink beer alone all day?	[]
Randy	7	0	It's okay, it's gluten free.	[]
Sharon	142	2	All right.  Do you know why young people like Lorde so much.  It's because she's something different. Kids have had pop music artists flash tits and crotch in their face, and most kids are actually smart enough to be sick of it. Lorde represents something in all of us, the truth that wants to be heard. If I could talk to Lorde right now, you know what I'd tell her? I'd tell her not to let people change who she is. I'd tell her that if people are making fun of her, it's probably because they lost touch with being human. I'd tell her to keep on doing what she does, because when someone's not allowed to express who they are inside, then we all lose. That's... what I would say to Lorde.	['tits', 'crotch']
Principal Victoria	39	0	And so it is with great pride that I can announce the student body has elected to get rid of the transgender bathroom, and give any fellow student the right to use the bathroom they feel most comfortable in.	[]
Cartman	19	0	I don't wanna use the girls bathroom if anyone can use it! It's gonna be all crowded.	[]
Principal Victoria	35	0	Anyone who has a problem sharing a bathroom with people who might be transgender will have to use the special designated bathroom designed to keep them away from the normal people who don't care.	[]
Butters	8	0	Hey! Where do you think you're going?!	[]
Stan	3	0	To the bathroom?	[]
Butters	16	0	Oh no you don't! You've gotta use the cissy bathroom!  Well go on, cissy!	[]
Stan	27	0	Wow, this is is pretty nice.  Feelin' good on a Monday. Got my space, all the freedom I need. Yah yah yah By myself, yah yah yah	[]
