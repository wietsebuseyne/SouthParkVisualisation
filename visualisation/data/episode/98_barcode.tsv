Butters	9	0	You know, Christopher Reeve, the guy who played Superman.	[]
Jimmy	16	0	I know who he is! But why is everyone ditching my comedy show to see him?!	[]
Butters	28	1	Ww-well, because he got crippled, but now he can move his finger. He is an inspiration to us all. That's why everyone ditched on your show.	['crippled']
Jimmy	6	0	So then, how come you came?	[]
Butters	12	0	Well, because I said I would. Oh, I'm a dork, huh?	[]
Mayor McDaniels	18	0	And so without further ado, here's the most courageous, most amazing man on the planet, Christopher Reeve.	[]
Reeve	24	0	Thank you, thank you, wow, what a great audience.  I just flew into South Park.  Used to be I didn't need an airplane.	[]
Townspeople	1	0	Awwwww.	[]
Reeve	14	0	As most of you know,  I am a strong supporter of stem-cell research.	[]
Jimmy	12	0	Say, fellas! Thanks a lot for goin' to my ...c-comedy show!	[]
Cartman	8	0	We didn't go to your comedy show.	[]
Jimmy	11	0	I know that, I was being f-f-f-fa...cetious!	[]
Stan	5	0	Look, dude. Christopher Reeve, dude.	[]
Jimmy	7	0	Ooh, Christopher Reeve! Whoop-de-freakin-do!	[]
Kyle	13	0	Dude, that's not cool. You shouldn't make fun of Christopher Reeve.	[]
Stan	4	0	Yeah dude, not cool.	[]
Reeve	16	0	Though it is controversial,  stem cell research is critical  in the quest for helping  the disabled.	[]
Jimmy	12	1	I put together a comedy show and I was crippled from BIRTH!	['crippled']
Stan	13	0	Uh, hoo. Guys, I think we'd better stay out of this one.	[]
Kyle	23	0	Yeah, this is starting to look like something we shouldn't be any part of. Let's go play with trucks or something.	[]
Timmy	5	0	Ha-a-aaa-haaa-a.	[]
Jimmy	6	1	Can you believe this asswipe, Timmy?	['asswipe']
Timmy	1	0	Timmeh!!	[]
Jimmy	18	1	Why is a celebrity who became crippled more important than us that were born that way, very much.	['crippled']
Timmy	2	0	Rrruh Timmeh!	[]
Reeve	17	0	In the coming days  I will prove to the world  that stem-cell research is a miracle.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Beep beep beep. Move it, Kenny! Beep.	[]

Stan	5	0	Oh hey Jimmy, hey Timmy.	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmih!	[]
Jimmy	20	1	Say, would you guys like to join our club? Oh, I'm sorry. You can't. You aren't crippled.	['crippled']
Kyle	1	0	What?	[]
Jimmy	36	3	To be in our club, not only do you have to be c-c-crippled, but you have to have been born that way. Do you know what that means? No butthole Superman asswipe Christopher Reeve!	['crippled', 'butthole', 'asswipe']
Stan	13	0	That's nice, guys. We're just gonna stay out of this one.	[]
Cartman	21	0	Hey, wait a minute!  You guys can't just start a club and tell me I can't be in it!	[]
Jimmy	7	0	Sorry, able-bodied, you can't join.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Can too!	[]
Jimmy	33	0	Hey Timmy. How many able-bodied people does it take to screw in a light bulb? One.  You know what you call an able-bodied guy on the doorstep? Whatever his name is.	[]
Cartman	3	1	Oh God-damnit!!	['damnit']
Kyle	6	0	Cartman, just stay out of it.	[]
Cartman	10	0	But they say I can't be in their club!!	[]
Stan	12	0	Cartman, trust me.  We don't want any part in this one.	[]
Jimmy	5	0	Hello, Mr. McGillicuuhuhuhh... Mr. McGillicuddy.	[]
McGillicuddy	8	0	Hello, boys. What can I do for you?	[]
Jimmy	21	0	Timmy and I made a ...T-shirt design for our new club.  We just came up with a name this morning.	[]
McGillicuddy	11	0	Uh... boys, I don't think you wanna wear these shirts	[]
Jimmy	2	0	Why not?	[]
McGillicuddy	23	0	Well, because there already is a group that calls themselves the Crips, and I don't think they'd like it too much.	[]
Jimmy	5	0	...There's already a Crips?!	[]
McGillicuddy	18	0	Well, sure, they're all over at Five Points area in Denver. You've never heard of them?	[]
Jimmy	17	2	No, we never have. Are they crippled from birth or are they cripple wannabes like Christopher Reeve?	['crippled', 'cripple']
McGillicuddy	8	0	...Oh, I am stayin' out of this one.	[]
Jimmy	24	1	Can you believe it, Timmy? All this time there was a group for truly crippled people like ourselves, and we didn't know it.	['crippled']
Timmy	1	0	Timmmeh!	[]
Jimmy	13	0	Come on. We have to take the bus to Five Points in Denver.	[]
King	29	0	My guest tonight is the brilliant star of stage and screen, Mr. Christopher Reeve, who,. with the help of stem-cell research, is now able to move his arms.	[]
Reeve	7	0	Thanks for having me on again, Larry.	[]
King	49	0	All right. Chris, the whole world is waiting. Why don't you show us what stem-cell research has done for you.  Amazing. Isn't that amazing, folks? Now, Chris, there're some people who say stem-cell research is wrong, that takling cells from a fetus is... unethical.	[]
Reeve	44	0	Well, it just proves that the public needs to be educated  about stem-cell research. See, the stem cells from a fetus like this one  can form into whatever cells of the body are damaged. They are the most powerful thing on the planet.	[]
King	13	0	And how does someone like yourself make use of the stem cells, Chris?	[]
Reeve	15	0	Well, it's very simple.  And now you can see, my arms have better movement.	[]
King	2	0	Wow.  Wow.	[]
Jimmy	14	0	Excuse me, sir.  we're looking for a group of people called the Crips.	[]
Bum	2	0	You are?	[]
Jimmy	16	0	Do you know where they meet? We've already tried the rec center and the library.	[]
Bum	15	0	The Crips hang out at that old warehouse down there,  but ...nobody goes in there.	[]
Jimmy	12	0	Oh, it's okay. We're Crips ourselves. Come on, Tim-Tim.	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmmih!	[]
Jimmy	13	0	Well hello everyone.  I'm Jim Swanson, and this is my friend Timmy.	[]
Timmy	4	0	Timmmih!  Tih... ti-timmih.	[]
Jimmy	43	0	Well, let us tell you a little bit about ourselves. Timmy and I are both true Crips, born and raised. We're the only Crips in South Park, where we live, and we would love to join your fa-fa-fabtasitc Denver chapter.	[]
Large Crip	5	0	Is they for real, manh?	[]
Jimmy	30	0	We just have one question before we join your c-club. Do you think it's better to be born a Crip, or to become a Crip later by accident?	[]
Braided Crip	7	0	The only Crips is born Crips, dawg.	[]
Tall Crip	10	0	Yeah, you can't become a Crip by accident, fool!	[]
Jimmy	26	1	I agree. I mean, it's like  come on! Why do these people who become crippled later in life think they're such great pot-potatuhs?	['crippled']
Timmy	1	0	Timmih!	[]
Jimmy	17	0	Well, we're glad you see it our way, fellas. So can we join your g... group?	[]

Jimmy	29	0	Down like a clown, Charlie Br... Down like a clown, Charlie B-broooowww... Down like a clown, Charlie Browh... Bro-uh-own. Down like a clown, Charlie Br-Brown.	[]
Jimmy	15	1	Say Timmy, did you notice that all the crippled people in that club are negros?	['crippled']
Timmy	1	0	Timmih!	[]
Jimmy	18	1	That's an amm-mmazing coincidence. I mean, there's not one crippled colored person in South Park.	['crippled']
Officer	3	0	Hey you kids.	[]
Jimmy	3	0	Well hello, officers.	[]
Officer	9	1	What the hell do you think you're doin'?	['hell']
Jimmy	9	1	We're goin' to pop some punk-ass Bloods.	['ass']
Timmy	1	0	Timmih!	[]
Jimmy	49	2	Look, Timmy. There's a convenience store.  That must be what the fellas meant by pop some punk-ass Bloods. They want us to get them some soda pop and treats.  Let's buy them ginger ale and marshmallows. Then they'll let us in the club for sure.	['ass', 'ginger']
Timmy	2	0	Oh, Timmih.	[]
Driver	2	1	Oh shit!	['shit']
Jimmy	6	0	Suh, suh, suh, suh, Sssunday driver!	[]
Buff Crip	27	0	Yo yo, listen up y'all! Let me tell you about my little Gs, Roller and 4 Legs here. They just smoked thirteen Bloods in one night!	[]

Buff Crip	7	0	That ain't never been done before!	[]
Crips	6	0	Uh huh. Cool. He's right.	[]

Buff Crip	28	0	You're not just in, you're the baddest mofo Crips in town! Cipac!  Turn up the beat so we can celebrate our new Gs Five-Points style!	[]
Cipac	2	0	All right.	[]
Jimmy	25	1	Wow, these guys really are crippled.  Timmy, I have a feeling that this is the start of something b-b-b-b...b-b-brilliant.	['crippled']
Timmy	1	0	Timmih!	[]
Jimmy	12	0	Thanks for the ride home, fellas. We sure had a ...terrific time.	[]
Cipac	6	0	Alrighty. Keep it real though, dawg.	[]
Jimmy	6	0	You dawgs keep it real, too.	[]

Jimmy	20	0	Well, that sure was a terrific time. Let's go all around tomorrow and show everyone our new outfits, Timmy.	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmih!	[]
Mom	4	0	There you are, Jimmy!	[]
Jimmy	5	0	Whatup, Mazie? Ye-yo, Pops?	[]
Pops	8	0	Jimmy, you rmother was gettin' worried about you.	[]
Jimmy	20	0	No need to worry about me. I'm cool like a fool in a swimming ppp-ppp-pp-pp-pool.	[]
Reporter	27	0	Tom, I'm standing out front of the Stem Cell Research Facility with terrific news. Christopher Reeve, who was once paralyzed, claims that he can now stand.	[]
Reeve	20	0	Thank you everyone.  To most people, this is just an ordinary fetus. But to people like me,  it's hope.	[]
Crowd	1	0	Uugh.	[]
Mr. Garrison	3	0	What an inspiration.	[]
Reporter	21	0	Tom, many celebrities have spoken out in protest of stem-cell research, but, after seeing this, how can they protest now?	[]
Stan	5	0	Stay clear, guys, stay clear.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Yup. I'm not seeing anything.	[]
Mr. Kim	8	0	Hey  Hey, I don't want no trouber!	[]

Jimmy	6	0	Yo, Mamsie. What's up, Pops?	[]
Pops	38	0	Uh have a seat, Jim. Your mother and I need to talk to you.  Son, your mother and I have noticed a change in your behavior. And... we're worried that you might be involved in a gang.	[]
Jimmy	24	0	A what? Oh, you mean the fellas. Well sure. But I can't talk about the club on account of its sssuper secret, dawg.	[]
Mamsie	9	0	Then it's true! Oh, Ryan, it's true!	[]
Jimmy	18	0	Why you be trippin', Mom? I mean  come on. I'm finally a part of something, very much.	[]
Ryan	11	0	Jimmy, those people you're hanging out with are no good.	[]
Jimmy	13	1	Yo, don't be dissing my niggaz, dawg. They're my f... friends.	['niggaz']
Mamsie	16	0	And what about your standup comedy, Jim, huh? Are you just giving up on that, too?	[]
Jimmy	22	1	Nobody cared about my standup comedy! All that hard work just to be outshined by C-Christopher Reeve the super b-butthole!	['butthole']
Ryan	17	0	Uh Jimmy, we've told you before. God made you the way he did for a reason!	[]
Jimmy	15	1	Right. Because you and Mom used to make fun of crippled kids in high school.	['crippled']
Ryan	30	0	That's right. You were sent here through the vengeful and angry hand of God to teach your mother and I a lesson. And that's a big responsibility, son.	[]
Jimmy	42	1	Look! My gang, which I can't talk about because it's super secret, is the most important thing to me now! And if you two don't like it, you can just pass the blunt to the nigga on your left.	['nigga']
Reeve	10	0	Where's that delivery of new fetuses?! Feeling weak again.	[]
Aide	7	0	Here's the new shipment, sir.  Hey!	[]
Man	3	0	Hello there, Christopher.	[]
Reeve	12	0	Well, well, Gene Hackman, my nemesis from the movies. How are you?	[]
Hackman	4	0	I'm good. You?	[]
Reeve	11	0	I am better with each passing day.  Stronger and more agile.	[]
Hackman	13	0	Christopher, I've come to ask you to stop what you're doing?	[]
Reeve	1	0	What?	[]
Hackman	12	0	Using stem cells is like playing God. You should leave nature alone.	[]
Reeve	15	0	And go back to the way I was? Is that what you're saying, Hackman?	[]
Hackman	17	0	I'm saying that sometimes you need to just live with the cards you're dealt, Christopher.	[]
Reeve	38	0	Stop calling me Christopher! That name no longer has meaning to me! Christopher was someone who lived in a wheelchair! Always being pushed around by others! The old Christopher Reeve is dead! From now on, I am...  Chris!	[]
Jimmy	9	0	Sixty-five... bottles of... beer on the wall. Six-	[]
Blood	3	1	Payback time, mothafucka!	['mothafucka']
Jimmy	10	0	Jesus Christ!  Holy G...guacamole!  Freakin' Frijoles!  Leapin' L-langosta.	[]
Blood	3	0	East Side Bloods!	[]
Hyde	13	0	We're Detectives Hyde and Richardson from the Special Gang unit in Denver.	[]
Jimmy	12	0	Any word on who shot up me and Timmy's houses, officer?	[]
Richardson	13	0	Word on the street is it was a retaliation hit by the Bloods.	[]
Jimmy	3	0	The... B-Bloods?	[]
Hyde	22	0	You know, smart-mouth! Your rival gang! The Bloods are at war with the Crips, they kill each other all the time!	[]
Jimmy	3	0	The-they do??	[]
Richardson	32	0	Don't act like you don't know, you lil punk! The Crips and Bloods hate each other, and if you stay in that gang, you're gonna end up dead too.	[]
Jimmy	8	0	But... but why do they hate each other?	[]
Hyde	14	0	Look kid, I used to be a Crip myself, but I'm not anymore!	[]
Jimmy	9	0	Oh, so you used ssstemm cells like Christopher Reeve?	[]
Hyde	17	0	Come on. The only way these kids are gonna get out of their gang is get killed.	[]
Ryan	1	0	Sarah!	[]
Jimmy	33	2	Oh boy, Timmy, we should have never started a gang for people crippled from birth. Now they're at war with the people who are crippled from an accident. Boy were we wrong.	['crippled', 'crippled']
Timmy	2	0	Tim-mih.	[]
Jimmy	88	0	Wow, w-we've got to do something, Timmy. We've gotta get the Crips and Bloods to sstop fighting. I bet if we could just get them together... but how? Wu-wait a minute! I've got it! A lock-in at the rec center! We did it for our church once. All we do is rent out the rec center overnight. They lock the doors so nobody can leave, and then everyone has the whole night to play in the swimming pool and laugh and talk.	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmih!!	[]
Jimmy	24	0	You get all the Crips you can to the rec center tomorrow night, Timmy. And I'll try to get all the ...Bloods there.	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmih!!	[]
Jimmy	6	0	This is gonna be t-terrific!	[]
Reporter	66	0	Tom, several years ago, actor Christopher Reeve had a horrible accident and was paralyzed. The irony, of course, is that the man who played Superman could no longer walk. America watched in wonder as he managed to move one of his fingers, then his arms. And now, seen for the first time on HBC, Christopher Reeve is going to lift a truck up over his head.	[]
Randy	4	0	Oh, what a fighter.	[]
Gerald	4	0	That brave, brave man.	[]
Liane	7	0	He's an imspration to us all.	[]
Reporter	22	0	Tom, the irony is even more irony-y as it appears that the stem cells have given Christopher Reeve almost superhuman strength.	[]
Hackman	4	0	Chris, that's enough!	[]
Reeve	7	0	Hello, Gene! So good to see you!	[]
Hackman	12	0	You're cured, Chris. It's time to stop using stem cells.	[]
Reeve	15	0	Stem-cell research has made me stronger than I ever thought possible! Why stop now?!	[]
Reporter	41	0	Uh Tom, apparently, Gene Hackman, the man who played Superman's enemy Lex Luthor in the movies, has now shown up as a celebrity protester of stem-cell research. If that isn't ironic, Tom, I don't knw what is.	[]
Hackman	19	0	They're affecting your mind, Chris. If you won't stop using stem cells, then we'll stop you!	[]
Reeve	24	0	Stop me?! Stop me?! HA!!  You won't stop me, Hack Man!  Ha HA! Ha HA! Ha haa haa!  Ya ha ha! Yaa haha!	[]
Reporter	18	0	Tom, if irony were made of strawberries, we'd all be drinking a lot of smoothies right now.	[]
Jimmy	21	0	Come on in, everybody. Lots of su-surprises and t-treats inside.  Great to see you all. What a terrific audience.	[]
Janitor	10	0	Are you sure you got everything you need, young man?	[]
Jimmy	8	0	We sure do. Thanks, Mr. Apple...b-by.	[]
Mr. Appleby	13	0	Just remember to make sure the kids play safe in the pool area.	[]
Jimmy	2	0	You bet.	[]
Mr. Appleby	16	0	I'll be back at seven to let you out. You kids have a good time.	[]
Jimmy	3	0	Oh, we will.	[]
Buff Crip	2	0	The Bloods!	[]
Blood 1	6	1	Oh shit! It's a trap!	['shit']
Blood 2	8	1	Muthafucka Crips tryin' to smoke us all out!	['muthafucka']
Crip	7	1	What the hell is goin' on here?	['hell']
Jimmy	39	0	It's called a lock-in at the rec center. We can use all the rec center facilities. We can play basketball, go swimming, or even just kick it in the lounge area with some games and ...p-puzzles.	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmih!	[]
Jimmy	32	0	But nobody can leave until it's seven a.m., so if you wanna have a good time, you're all just gonna have to learn to get along.  Theeerrre's pizzaaa.	[]
Reporter	56	0	Tom, over five years ago, doctors told Christopher Reeve that he would never walk again, but the resilient actor fought back, struggled against all odds, and has now built his very own Legion of Doom!  The once immobile Mr. Reeve's new organization will be committed to world domination and evil. What an inspirational story, Tom.	[]
Reeve	50	0	I have chosen each member of this elite group of supervillains for their outstanding treachery,  Their desire for world conquest,  and their hatred of all things good!  And I've assembled this group for one purpose! To once and for all find a way to...  get rid of Hack Man!!	[]
Dr. Doom	7	0	Uhhh, how about domination of the world?	[]
Saddam Hussein	7	0	Yeah. Or uh, death to the infidels?	[]
Reeve	16	0	Silence! OUR job is to see to it that Hack Man is put out of commission.	[]
Professor Chaos	13	0	Oh boy, General Disarray, muh maybe we just oughtta stay outta this one.	[]
Hackman	4	0	Not so fast, Chris!	[]
Reeve	2	0	Hack Man!	[]
Hackman	16	0	We just helped pass a ban on stem-cell research. Your fetus-sucking days are over!	[]
Reeve	2	0	No...  NOOOO!	[]
Hackman	17	0	And now we're goingn to put you somewhere where you can never touch another fetus again!	[]
Buff Crip	5	0	You stupid mofos are dead!	[]
Blood 3	5	0	Make the first shot, punk!	[]
Jimmy	25	2	Hold it! Don't you see? It doesn't matter if we were crippled from birth, or crippled in an accident. We're all brothers.	['crippled', 'crippled']
Blood 4	8	0	Save it, fool! Crips ain't our brothers!	[]
Jimmy	19	0	Look: we hve the whole rec room to ourselves. Can't we all just try having some fun together?	[]
Blood 5	6	0	Yeah, we ain't playin', sucka!	[]
Jimmy	14	0	Why don't we at least give it a chance? I mean,  Come on!	[]
Buff Crip	7	0	Wait a minute. What did you say?	[]
Jimmy	6	0	I said, I mean,  Come on!	[]
Blood 4	10	0	You know, maybe he's right. I mean,  Come on!	[]
Jimmy	2	0	Come on.	[]
Buff Crip	17	0	I guess we could at least give havin' fun together a try. It's like  Come on.	[]
Blood 6	3	0	Yeah. Come on.	[]
Crip 2	6	0	Yeah, that's right. Come on.	[]
Jimmy	2	0	Come on.	[]
Someone	2	0	Come on.	[]
All	6	0	Yeah, that's right. Come on.	[]
Buff Crip	16	0	I've gotta give you two dawgs props for puttin' an end to all this hate.	[]
Jimmy	48	1	I told you, lock-ins at the rec center always work. And you know, I've learned something, too. I was player-hatin' Christopher Butthole Reeve because he got more attention than me. But just like... y-you guys, I need to learn to control my a... anger.	['butthole']
Blood	2	0	Right on!	[]
Crip	9	1	Hey little Roller, try some of this chronic shit.	['shit']
Timmy	1	0	Timmih!	[]
Jimmy	30	0	I guess we all learned that trying to get along is way better than p... player hatin'.  The gang wrote a song about it. Why don't we listen in?	[]
Gang Members	41	0	It used to be that Crips and Bloods didn't get along, But now we're all a family, so we wrote this song. Naaa na naaa, Crips and Bloods. Naaa na naaa, hope and love. Naaa na naaa, friendly thugs.	[]
Reeve	14	0	You haven't seen the last of me, Hack Man! I will be back!!	[]
Stan	11	0	Dude, I am so glad we stayed out of that one.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Mee tooo.	[]
