Gerald	21	0	Wow! It seems like you had a great time with the Super Adventure Club, Chef. They sound like really interesting people.	[]
Chef	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Mrs. Garrison	20	0	But now that you're back here, does that mean that you're not in the Super Adventure Club anymore?	[]
Chef	1	0	Nnono!	[]
Randy	21	0	Ohhh, so have you decided you can still belong to the Super Adventure Club but live here in South Park again?	[]
Chef	3	0	That's right.	[]
Randy	52	0	Well, it seems like the Super Adventure Club was just what you needed, Chef. You must be feeling very happy that you found a club to belong to with new friends, but that you can also live here in South Park with all your old friends whom you care for deeply.  Right?	[]
Chef	4	0	That's right. Randy!	[]
Jimbo	14	0	Well Chef, you're welcome to stay with me until you buy another house.	[]
Chef	3	0	Thank you. Jimbo.	[]

Chef	5	0	You bet! Good-bye. Children!	[]
Stan	4	0	Right. Uh, see ya.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Uh, guys? Did Chef seem a little, uh, trippy to you?	[]
Stan	17	0	Well, look. he said he's happier now. Maybe he just needs to rest up a little.	[]
Kyle	13	0	Yeah. I'm sure whatever that Super Adventure Club does is pretty tiring.	[]
Stan	12	0	Yeah, but whatever, I'm just glad he's back for good.	[]
Kenny	3	0	(Yeah, me too.)	[]
A Boy	16	0	It's really weird what he said. I don't know, it kind of confused me.	[]
Cartman	15	0	Oh boy oh boy, I can't wait to have Chef's lunch food again.	[]
Kyle	11	0	Yeah. I hope he makes his Salisbury steak with buttered noodles!	[]
Clyde	4	0	You guys, you guys.	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Clyde	12	0	Something's wrong with Chef. He's saying some really weird stuff.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Like what?	[]
Clyde	11	1	I think...  I think he wants to have sex with me.	['sex']
Stan	1	0	What??	[]
Clyde	5	0	I gotta- I gotta go.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Weirdo.	[]
Chef	3	0	Hello there, children!	[]
The Boys	2	0	Hey Chef.	[]
Chef	4	0	How's it goin'?	[]
Kyle	1	0	Good.	[]
Chef	13	0	Well, how about I meet you boys after work and we make love?	[]
Cartman	2	0	Excuse me?	[]
Chef	14	1	Come on, children! You're my sexual fantasy. Let's all make sweet love.	['sexual']
Kyle	5	0	...Chef?? A-are you okay?	[]
Chef	10	1	I want to stick my balls inside your rectum, Kyle.	['balls']
Stan	5	0	Dude, what are you saying??	[]
Chef	9	1	I'm gonna make love to your asshole, children.	['asshole']
Stan	1	0	...WHAT??	[]
Det. Jarvis	20	0	Hi kids, I'm Detective Jarvis. I need to ask you all some difficult questions about your school cafeteria chef.	[]
Kyle	6	0	This doesn't make any sense!	[]
Det. Jarvis	16	0	We have some information that all this time Chef has been and still is a pedophile.	[]
Stan	4	0	No, he's not.	[]
Det. Jarvis	2	0	Uh huh.	[]
Stan	4	0	No, he's not.	[]
Det. Jarvis	5	0	Yeah, yeah he is so.	[]
Butters	4	0	What's a pedophile?	[]
Det. Jarvis	32	0	Now, we need some testimony in order to arrest Chef,  so I'm gonna use this doll to ask you kids a few questions. Did Chef ever touch any of you... here?	[]
Stan	1	0	NO!	[]
Det. Jarvis	6	0	Okay, did he touch you here?	[]
The Class	1	0	NO!	[]
Det. Jarvis	8	0	Did he ever do this? How about this?	[]
Butters	8	0	My Uncle Bud did that to me once!	[]
Det. Jarvis	10	0	Did Chef ever try one of these on for size?	[]
Kyle	13	1	Goddammit, Chef isn't like that! Something funny is going on around here!	['goddammit']
Det. Jarvis	14	0	Young man, will you PLEASE pay attention! This is very important stuff! Ohhh. Ohhhhhh.	[]
Chef	3	0	Hello there, children!	[]
Kyle	8	0	Chef, the police are asking questions about you!	[]
Chef	11	0	Oh really? Well, let's all go home and make love.	[]

Chef	10	1	Kenny, how would you like to sodomize my black ass	['ass']
Kyle	15	0	Chef, CHEF! You need to get out of here before you get arrested, all right?!	[]
Chef	6	1	I specializes in your asshole, Kyle.	['asshole']
Cartman	14	1	...Man, I can't believe all this time, Chef just wanted us for sex.	['sex']
Kyle	15	1	He didn't want us for sex, fatass! Something is making him say those things.	['sex']
Kenny	2	0	(Like what?)	[]
Kyle	24	0	Something must have happened to Chef while he was gone. Maybe he hit his head or, or got stuck in some quantum time vortex.	[]
Stan	19	0	Well look: he spent the last three months with that adventurers' club. Maybe they know what happened to him.	[]
Kenny	3	0	(Yeah! I think...)	[]
Cartman	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Kyle	5	0	All right, come on guys!	[]
Cartman	14	3	Hey you guys, you know what they call a Jewish woman's boobs? Jewbs.	['jewish', 'boobs', 'jewbs']
Butler	4	0	May I help you.	[]
Kyle	11	0	Ahh, hi, can we speak to the head guy or something?	[]
Butler	3	0	Right this way.	[]
Head Adventurer	19	0	Now, the upper rim of Kilimanjaro should be quite a trek, and so we'll need to have a-	[]
Butler	10	0	Excuse me, sir. These boys wanted to speak with you.	[]
Head Adventurer	20	0	Ahh yes, splendid! Good afternoon, lads! I'm Head Adventurer William P. Connolly, Esquire! Welcome, to the Super Adventure Club!	[]
Club Members	2	1	Tally ho!	['ho']
Mr. Connolly	1	0	Indeed!	[]
Kyle	17	1	Uh, hi. Our friend joined your club a while back, and now he wants to molest kids.	['molest']
Mr. Connolly	14	0	What? Well... well yes, of course! That's what the Super Adventure Club does!	[]
Cartman	1	0	...Huh?	[]
Marksman	9	1	We travel the world and have sex with children!	['sex']
Marine	6	0	Yes, what else would we do?	[]
Kyle	11	0	Well, we thought you went exploring and like, hunting and stuff!	[]
Mr. Connolly	63	2	Noo, no, that's the Adventure Club. We're the Super Adventure Club!  Next week, we'll be heading to the outer banks of the Amazon, where we will make camp and have sex with children of the Ugani tribe, then it's off to the mighty Himalayas, where we will climb K-2, and molest several Tibetan children on the east summit.	['sex', 'molest']
Kyle	1	0	...Dude!	[]
Mr. Connolly	73	2	I know, but it gets even better! From there we will kayak to the fruitful banks of the Mele River in Africa, where the secret and mysterious Hanimi people have children who have never seen a white man's erect penis. Of course, we're always looking for kids to have sex with on the plane rides over to these places, so how would you ALL like to join the Super Adventure Club!	['penis', 'sex']
Stan	1	0	NO!!	[]
Mr. Connolly	19	0	No? Oh really? Perhaps I should ask you again?  How would you like to join the Super Adventure Club?	[]
Stan	1	0	No!	[]
Kyle	5	0	Dude, what are you doing?!	[]
Mr. Connolly	12	0	Oh well, it doesn't work on everybody.  Well, so long then.	[]
Kyle	7	1	Just what the hell is that thing?!	['hell']
Mr. Connolly	8	0	What? What thing? I don't see anything.	[]
Kyle	4	0	HA! I knew it!	[]
Stan	2	0	Knew what?	[]
Kyle	22	0	The reason Chef has been saying those terrible things about us is because he's been brainwashed! By this- fruity little club!	[]
Cartman	5	1	Oh, son of a bitch!	['bitch']
Chef	11	0	Come on, children. Let's all go home and make love.	[]
Stan	13	0	You need to see a psychiatrist, Chef. It's for your own good.	[]
Chef	9	1	I just like to make love up your butt.	['butt']
Woman	3	0	Oh my God!	[]
Nurse	4	0	Mr. Chef, is it?	[]
Kyle	4	0	All right, come on.	[]
Dr. Neeland	12	0	Hello, I'm Dr. Neeland. What can I do for you today?	[]
Kyle	12	0	Hi, uh- our friend has been brainwashed by some fruity little club.	[]
Dr. Neeland	1	0	Brainwashed.	[]
Stan	24	1	Yeah, he joined the Super Adventure Club, and they convinced him having sex with children was okay with a little thing that goes whrrrrrr.	['sex']
Dr. Neeland	9	0	I thought that club was for hiking and kayaking.	[]
Stan	14	1	No, that's the Adventure Club. The Super Adventure Club has sex with children.	['sex']
Dr. Neeland	6	0	Oh. ...Oh, that's right, yeah.	[]
Chef	5	0	Doctor, do you have- children?	[]
Dr. Neeland	7	0	Why, yes, I have two young boys.	[]
Chef	8	0	Have you all been sodomizing your children too?	[]
Dr. Neeland	9	0	You say he's never been like this before?	[]
Cartman	7	0	No, Chef has always been super-cool.	[]
Chef	8	0	I'm gonna make love to the children.	[]
Dr. Neeland	12	0	He's pretty brainwashed all right. Worst case I've ever seen.	[]
Cartman	5	0	So what can we do??	[]
Dr. Neeland	22	0	I'm afraid there's no simple answer. When somebody's brainwashed it can take months, even years, to reverse the process.	[]
Kyle	18	0	But we don't have years! If Chef keeps this up, he's gonna go to jail forever!	[]
Dr. Neeland	17	1	Tell me, what was Chef's favorite thing to do before it was having sex with children?	['sex']
Stan	4	1	Having sex with women.	['sex']
Dr. Neeland	16	0	Then that's it. We'd better get your friend to the Peppermint Hippo right away.	[]
DJ	21	0	All right guys, be sure to tip the waitresses; this is two for one; put your hands together, this is Monique!	[]
Chef	8	0	Aw, come on, children. Let's go home.	[]
Stan	4	0	This isn't working.	[]
Dr. Neeland	9	0	Well let's... give it some more time, kids.	[]
Stripper	5	0	Would you like to daaance???	[]
Kyle	9	0	No thanks. We're trying to unbrainwash our friend.	[]
Stripper	4	0	Daaance??? Anybody wanna daaance???	[]
Cartman	4	1	Come on, bitch! Dance!	['bitch']
Blonde	3	1	Up yours, fatty.	['fatty']
Cartman	7	2	Bitch, I'll twist your nuts off!	['bitch', 'nuts']
DJ	25	0	All right guys, help me feel it out to them; we got a featured dancer coming out next; put your hands together for... Spontaneous Bootay!	[]
Stan	8	0	Come on guys, we might as well go.	[]
Chef	2	1	God-damn!	['damn']
Stan	4	0	Chef, we're leaving.	[]
Dr. Neeland	5	0	Nono, wait. Let him go.	[]
Spontaneous Bootay	3	0	Come here, chubby.	[]
Chef	3	0	Wait a minute.	[]
Stan	3	0	He's remembering.	[]
Chef	5	0	Children! What have I done?	[]
Cartman	7	0	It's okay Chef. Go on, remember!	[]
Chef	6	0	I'm goinna- I'm gonna-	[]
Kyle	7	0	Come on, Chef! You can do it!	[]
Chef	15	0	I'm gonna make love to you woman, 'gonna lay you down by the fire!	[]
The Boys	1	0	Yay!	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Chef!)	[]
Chef	7	0	Hey children, everybody! I'm back!  Ow.	[]
Mr. Connolly	7	0	Great shot, William! Hit him with another.	[]
Chef	1	0	Oh!	[]
The Boys	1	0	Chef!	[]
Mr. Connolly	17	2	Tally ho, lads! I must say you're starting to become quite a thorn in my balls.	['ho', 'balls']
Stan	9	0	Where's Chef?! What have you done with him?!	[]
Mr. Connolly	28	0	He's safe.  He's fasting in the Deprivation Room and being read the Super Adventure Club manual. We've got to undo the damage you've done.	[]
Cartman	20	1	Look: If you wanna go around the world molesting kids, that's totally fine. But why do you need Chef?!	['molesting']
Mr. Connolly	46	1	We don't need him, he needs us! Our club offers hope. Do you think we go around the world molesting children just because it feels really really really really good?! No! Our club has a message! And a secret that explains the mysteries of life!	['molesting']
Stan	5	0	Oh Jesus, here we go.	[]
Mr. Connolly	16	0	Very well. I'm now going to tell you the secret of the Super Adventure Club.	[]
Stan	6	0	We don't wanna hear it.	[]
Mr. Connolly	134	5	You see, the Super Adventure Club was founded by the greatest explorer of all time, William P. Phinehas!  Phinehas climbed the highest peaks, tamed the mightiest rivers,  but every time he got somewhere, he realized that other explorers had beat him to it.  Phinehas was depressed, until he realized that if he couldn't be the first to discover places, he could be the first to have sex with the native children that inhabited those areas!  Phinehas quickly went down in history books as the first man to have sex with the Aborigine children at Uluru, and the first explorer to bugger all the underage mountainfolk of Nepal.  But now the most wonderful part. You see, after having sex with all those children, Phinehas realized that... molesting all those kids... had made him immortal.	['sex', 'sex', 'bugger', 'sex', 'molesting']
Stan	1	0	Immortal.	[]
Mr. Connolly	61	1	He discovered that children have things called marlocks in their bodies.  And when an adult has sex with a child, the marlocks implode, feeding the adult receptive cavity with energy that causes immortality, so saith the ruler of Bethos.  Phinehas traveled the world, loving many, many children, and he lived for eternity. Until he was hit by a train in 1892.	['sex']
Kyle	7	1	...Do you realize how retarded that sounds?	['retarded']
Mr. Connolly	32	2	Is it any more retarded than the idea of God sending his son to die for our sins? Is it any more retarded than Buddha sitting beneath a tree for twenty years?	['retarded', 'retarded']
Stan	7	1	Yeah, it's way, way more retarded.	['retarded']
Mr. Connolly	28	0	Well, now that you know our club secrets, it appears you ... leave us no choice. I'm afraid we're going to have to... ask you to leave.	[]
Stan	6	0	We're not leaving without Chef.	[]
Mr. Connolly	61	0	If you choose not to leave, then I'm afraid we're just going to have to ... call security and make you leave.  You'll be let out by security and it will be super-embarrassing and everyone here will see!  Okay, you know how like, when you want people to leave but they won't leave, it's really frustrating?	[]
Kyle	7	0	We're not going anywhere without Chef.	[]
Mr. Connolly	38	0	Cool people leave before they've overstayed their welcome.  You petulant fools! You just had to push it, didn't you? You don't realize who you're dealing with here. Security!  Take these boys to the door.	[]
Guard 1	5	0	All right, come on kids.	[]
Kyle	2	0	No! Hey!	[]
Mr. Connolly	10	0	Haha! Look they're being led out by security! Haha!	[]
Stan	14	0	No, you don't understand! They've got our friend in the Deprivation Room!	[]
Guard 2	11	0	This is their house and they don't want you here.	[]
Kyle	12	0	Sorry, dude, but this fruity little club isn't taking our friend!	[]
William	9	1	And sex with Eskimo children requires some special skills.	['sex']
Kyle	3	0	Chef, come on!	[]
Chef	1	0	Children!	[]
William	4	0	Get out of here!	[]
Cartman	5	0	Kenny! Spin Blossom Nut Squash!	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Yeeeeehah!)	[]
Stan	3	0	Come on, Chef!	[]
Chef	6	0	I can't... break these locks.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Here!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Run Chef!	[]
Mr. Connolly	7	0	What the-? Impossible! I made them leave!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Get outside!	[]
Mr. Connolly	2	0	Stop them!	[]
Chef	2	0	Children! Run!	[]
Mr. Connolly	1	0	Stop!	[]
Stan	3	0	We made it!	[]
Mr. Connolly	13	0	Don't you remember why you left South Park in the first place??	[]
Stan	3	0	Chef, come on!	[]
Mr. Connolly	17	0	You sought adventure! And why do people seek adventure? Because their lives have become dull and empty!	[]
Kyle	13	1	Yeah, he wanted adventure! Not a bunch of ridiculous bullcrap! Right Chef?  Chef?	['bullcrap']
Mr. Connolly	18	0	Don't forget all your training, Chef! Stay with us and your life will be GRAND and ETERNAL!	[]
Stan	4	0	Chef, we love you.	[]
Chef	4	0	I'm sorry children.	[]
Kyle	14	0	No! Chef, they've filled your head with lies! Can't you see that??	[]
Chef	7	1	Get the hell out of here, children!!	['hell']
Mr. Connolly	12	0	Yesss. Looks like our fruity little club is safe after all.  NO!	[]
The Boys	1	0	Chef!	[]
Chef	8	1	Ack.  Ow! Oh! Ah! Oh! Dammit!  Ah- Awww!	['dammit']
Stan	1	0	NO!	[]
Cartman	3	0	A mountain lion!	[]
Mr. Connolly	8	0	We can't lose another member! Shoot it!	[]
Chef	1	0	Ah!	[]
Marksman	3	0	All right, this!	[]
Kyle	1	0	CHEF!	[]
Cartman	3	0	A grizzly bear!	[]
Stan	6	0	Oh my God... They killed Chef.	[]
Kyle	4	2	You bastards. YOU BASTARDS!	['bastards', 'bastards']
Mr. Connolly	9	1	Pity. He would have made an excellent child molester.	['molester']
Cartman	21	1	Maybe- maybe he's still okay.  No, really. They say the last thing you do before you die is crap your-	['crap']
Chef	1	0	POOOT!	[]
Cartman	3	0	Oh never mind.	[]
Stan	5	0	Come on, let's go.	[]
Kyle	128	0	We're all here today because Chef has been such an important part of our lives. A lot of us don't agree with the choices Chef has made in the past few days.  Some of us... feel hurt... and confused that he seemed to turn his back on us.  But we can't let the events of the last week take away the memories of how much Chef made us smile.  I'm gonna remember Chef as the jolly old guy who always broke into song.  I'm gonna remember Chef... as the guy who gave us advice to live by.  So you see, we shouldn't be mad at Chef for leaving us. We should be mad at that little fruity club for scrambling his brains.	[]
Randy	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Mr. Mackey	3	0	He's right.	[]
Kyle	24	0	And in the end, I know that somewhere out there... there's the good part of Chef... that's still alive in us all.	[]
Mr. Connolly	6	0	Is it working? Is it working?	[]
Tech	6	0	Yes. We've got a pulse!	[]
Mr. Connolly	22	0	Get him in the ICU suit! Hurry!  We have done it! Good! Raise him up!  Chef, can you hear me? Say something.	[]
Darth Chef	10	0	Hello there, children. How would you like some Salisbury steak?	[]
Mr. Connolly	3	0	Yes, go on.	[]
Darth Chef	15	1	And for desert, how would you children like to suck on my chocolate salty balls?	['balls']
Mr. Connolly	7	0	Oh? You mean like a chocolate candy?	[]
Darth Chef	5	1	No, I mean my balls.	['balls']
Mr. Connolly	3	0	Yes, YES! Hahahahahahaaa!	[]
