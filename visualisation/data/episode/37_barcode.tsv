Mr. Garrison	34	1	Okay, children. Let's take our seats. We have something very important to discuss. Due to recent events around the country I've been instructed to teach you all about sexual harassment in school.	['sexual']
Kyle	2	0	About what?	[]
Mr. Garrison	10	1	Now, does anybody know what sexual harassment means?  Yes, Eric?	['sexual']
Cartman	23	1	When you're trying to have intercourse with a lady friend, and some other guy comes up and tickles your balls from behind.	['balls']
Mr. Garrison	35	2	...No, Eric! That's not what I'm talking about! The school board has sent over a special guest to teach us all about sexual harassment in schools. Please welcome Petey, the Sexual Harassment Panda.	['sexual', 'sexual']

Class	4	1	Hi, Sexual Harassment Panda.	['sexual']
Clyde	1	0	Hababah...	[]
Petey	29	1	Did you know that when one little panda pulls on another little panda's underwear, that's sexual harassment? That makes me a sa-a-a-a-ad panda.	['sexual']
Kyle	6	0	This is freaking me out, dude.	[]
Petey	44	1	And when one little panda puts his furry little willy in another panda's ear, that makes me a very sad panda.  Now, I'm going to pass out these booklets, and we're going to go through each and every sexual harassment law.	['sexual']
Class	1	0	Awgh..!	[]
Petey	21	1	...Article 36, Section 19: One panda may not make sexual comments about another panda's appearance. If said panda does make...	['sexual']
Stan	7	0	Ohh, dude, get me out of here!	[]
Cartman	7	1	I think Sexual Harassment Panda is cool.	['sexual']
Stan	8	2	You would think that, you little ass-sucker.	['ass', 'sucker']
Cartman	5	0	What did you call me?	[]
Stan	20	6	An ass-sucker. It means you suck ass. You see an ass, you suck it. You're an ass-sucker.	['ass', 'sucker', 'ass', 'ass', 'ass', 'sucker']
Cartman	10	1	That does it! I am suing you for sexual harassment!	['sexual']

Cartman	25	1	You have... sexually harassed me for the last time! It says right here... that now I can sue you and take all of your money.	['sexually']
Petey	5	0	That's right, he can.	[]
Stan	8	2	No you can't, you little ass-sucker!	['ass', 'sucker']
Cartman	9	0	Oh, you did it again! You all heard him!	[]
Petey	21	0	The first party of the first panda may sue the second-party panda unless that panda was said panda aforementioned panda.	[]
Judge Julie	14	0	This is Cartman vs. Marsh, Case No. 3433. What is your complaint, Mr. Cartman?	[]
Cartman	15	0	Your Honor, my lawyer is just parking the car. He should be here any second.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Dude! He got a lawyer?	[]
Gerald	4	0	Sorry I'm late.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Dad?!	[]
Gerald	3	0	Oh! Hi, Kyle.	[]
Judge Julie	23	1	All right. Let's move this along, shall we? Now, Eric Cartman, uh, you claim that Stan Marsh sexually harassed you in school.	['sexually']
Cartman	6	0	Th... That is correct, my honor.	[]
Stan	2	0	Hoh, whatever!	[]
Cartman	9	2	He talked about having oral sex with my ass.	['sex', 'ass']
Stan	6	2	I called you an ass-sucker!	['ass', 'sucker']
Cartman	42	0	Yes, that was it. I was suh-so upset.  I couldn't concentrate the rest of the day. And the way his eyes kept looking at me, slowly going up and down my body, like he was undressing me with his eyes.	[]
Stan	9	0	What?! Cartman, you call people names all the time!	[]
Gerald	13	0	As you can see, Your Honor, my client is too upset to continue.	[]
Judge Julie	8	0	Mr. Marsh, what do you have to say?	[]
Stan	4	0	Wwhat do you mean?	[]
Judge Julie	6	0	I need to hear your defense.	[]
Stan	4	0	Uh... I'm eight?	[]
Judge Julie	25	1	All right, this seems pretty open-and-shut. Stan Marsh, under the new Sexual Harassment in Schools law, I am forced to find you guilty.	['sexual']
Stan	1	0	Huh?	[]
Gerald	5	0	All right, we did it!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Hooray!	[]
Judge Julie	33	0	Since the defendant is underage and has no monetary resources, it is the judgment of this court that 50% of Stan Marsh's belongings are to be handed over to Eric Cartman immediately.	[]
Stan	8	0	I have to give him half my stuff?	[]
Cartman	1	0	Sweet..!	[]
Cartman	26	0	Let's see. I want that Clown Criminy game , and that Power Jim doll.  And, let's see...  Do you really like this remote-controlled truck?	[]
Stan	7	0	Yeah, dude. That's my favorite toy.	[]
Cartman	18	0	Oh, well, I'll just take that, then.  And what about this? Is this one of your favorites?	[]
Stan	6	0	Uh, no! I hate that toy!	[]
Cartman	10	0	Oh, then you won't mind if I take it!	[]
Stan	1	1	Damnit!	['damnit']
Collector	19	0	Here you go. As your legal fee you can choose between the green choo-choo or the squishy football.	[]
Gerald	9	0	Hm.  You know, Eric, I've been thinking, uh...	[]
Cartman	8	0	Uh-huh? That model airplane kit? Go on.	[]
Gerald	20	0	Uh, you know, the people really responsible for your harassment is the public schools.  Perhaps we should sue them next.	[]
Cartman	9	0	What? But uh, why should I sue the school?	[]
Gerald	36	0	Well, because they're the ones that let this harassment go on. And, they have a lot more money. I think we could get a lot more out of this than half of Stan's belongings.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Interesting.  Ooo, Stan's asthma inhaler. I want that.	[]
Judge Julie	15	1	Answer the question. Did you know that sexual harassment was going on in the classroom?	['sexual']
Mr. Garrison	6	0	No, I had no freakin' idea!	[]
Gerald	10	1	Mr. Garrison, do you know the definition of sexual harassment?	['sexual']
Mr. Garrison	13	1	Of course, and so does Mr. Hat. We do not tolerate sexual harassment!	['sexual']
Judge Julie	10	0	You are the witness here, Mr. Garrison, not Mr. Hat.	[]
Mr. Garrison	4	0	I'm sorry, toots.	[]
Gerald	14	2	Did you, or did you not, hear my client being called an ass-sucker?	['ass', 'sucker']
Mr. Garrison	1	0	Yes.	[]
Gerald	4	0	And you did nothing.	[]
Mr. Garrison	7	2	Well, he is a little ass-sucker.	['ass', 'sucker']
Judge Julie	11	0	Mr. Garrison, I will remind you that we are in court!	[]
Mr. Garrison	5	0	Okay, baby, I'm sorry.	[]
Gerald	14	0	Principal Victoria, were you aware that my client was being harassed at your school?	[]
Principal Victoria	8	0	Well, not any more than any other student.	[]
Gerald	8	0	Oh! So you admit that harassment goes on!	[]
Principal Victoria	4	0	I don't know!	[]
Gerald	8	0	You don't know?! You're the principal!	[]
Principal Victoria	7	0	I can't be around every second!	[]
Gerald	5	0	So it DOES go on!!!	[]
Principal Victoria	55	0	All right, all right, I killed him. I hit him over the head and I cut up the body. I tried to burn him, but it wouldn't burn! Oh, the smell of it! I put the legs in garbage bags and hid the torso under a bridge. I HAD TO DO IT!!  OH GOD!!!	[]
Gerald	12	2	Principal Victoria, was Eric Cartman called an ass-sucker? Yes or no?	['ass', 'sucker']
Principal Victoria	4	0	I believe so, yes.	[]
Man	4	1	That's sexual harassment.	['sexual']
Gerald	13	1	Last, I'd like to bring up my expert witness: Sexual Harassment Panda.	['sexual']
Petey	12	1	Who lives in the caves 'neath the willow tree? Sexual Harassment Panda	['sexual']
Gerald	12	1	Expert witness, did South Park Elementary allow sexual harassment to go on?	['sexual']
Petey	17	2	Well, when one little panda asks another little panda to perform oral sex, that is sexual harassment.	['sex', 'sexual']
Gerald	5	0	And who's to blame?	[]
Petey	13	0	I'm afraid the law states that the school must be held responsible.	[]
Gerald	10	0	There! You have it! Straight from the horse's mouth!	[]
Petey	1	0	Panda.	[]
Gerald	4	0	Pan-Panda's mouth.	[]
Judge Julie	23	0	After careful review, it is the judgment of this court that South Park Elementary pays Eric Theodore Cartman $1.3 million in damages.	[]
Gerald	6	0	All right! We did it, Eric!	[]
Cartman	11	0	It's time to celebrate, yeahIt's time to celebrate, yeah	[]
Gerald	16	0	That goes in the master bedroom.  Well, Kyle. What do you think of your new house?	[]
Kyle	3	0	It's... big.	[]
Gerald	11	0	Yes, it is big, isn't it? It is very big.	[]
Kyle	19	0	Dad, if the school has to pay you and Cartman $1.3 million, where does that money come from?	[]
Gerald	36	0	Well Kyle, schools have lots of money. You see, we all pay taxes, and part of that tax money goes to public schools, and it's from that money that we got our 1.3 million.	[]
Kyle	9	0	And you don't see a problem with that?	[]
Gerald	17	0	No. It's a very fragile system that nature has designed. All things flow into each other.	[]
Kyle	10	0	You're trying to confuse me now, aren't you?	[]
Gerald	3	0	Sort of, yeah.	[]
Mr. Garrison	23	0	Okay, children, there's a few changes being made here at school, but lessons will go on as normal. Any questions?  Yes, Stan?	[]
Stan	4	0	Where's our desks?	[]
Mr. Garrison	20	0	Right, desks. Well, a lot of cuts had to be made since the school's funding is short for lawsuits.	[]
Stan	9	0	You see, Cartman? You see what this has done?	[]
Cartman	23	1	All I know is, I got this sweet digital watch and these cool shoes; I'm telling you guys, suing people kicks ass!	['ass']
Clyde	5	0	Wow! I wanna sue somebody!	[]
Bebe	7	0	Me, too. I wanna get a lawyer.	[]
Class	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Woohoo!)	[]
Mr. Garrison	33	0	Well, let's just try to cope with the changes and do our schoolwork. Now, I'm gonna write a sentence on the board, and I want you to tell me the noun.	[]
Class	1	0	AAGGGHHH!!	[]
Mr. Garrison	35	0	I know, I know. I'm sorry, children, but we can't afford chalk anymore. I have to write on the chalkboard with this rusty nail. Anyway, children, in the sentence, The ball is red...	[]
Class	1	0	AAGGGGHHH!!	[]

Bebe	42	0	After a boy in my class tried to put his tongue in my mouth, I knew I needed legal help. Kyle's dad helped me get a $1.6 million settlement, and this bright new shiny bicycle. Thank you, Kyle's dad!	[]
Clyde	23	0	Kyle's dad got me 1.4 million, and he can do it for you, too. Just look at all these beautiful girls!	[]
Gerald	22	0	So call me, Kyle's dad. Because it's not about money, it's about... wait, what am I saying? Call me!	[]

Woman	14	1	Uh, next we have Tom Morris. He plays Sexual Harassment Panda at the schools.	['sexual']
Chairman	9	0	Oh, right. We certainly can't afford him anymore.	[]
Woman	14	0	I warn you, Mr. Evans, uh, Tom Morris takes his job a little seriously.	[]
Petey	16	2	Hello, sexual harassment cubs. Who lives in the caves 'neath the willow tree? Sexual Harassment Panda	['sexual', 'sexual']

Petey	3	0	Oh, all right.	[]
Mr. Evans	33	1	Uh-M-m-m-Mr. Morris, we at the school board have been thinking, and, we've decided that perhaps a panda isn't the best way to explain sexual harassment to children.	['sexual']
Woman	21	1	You see, Mr. Morris, we believe that a panda doesn't really have anything to do with... sexual harassment.  At all.	['sexual']
Mr. Evans	13	0	...I'm afraid we're just going to have to let you go.	[]
Petey	9	0	I'm a sa-a-a-a-ad panda.	[]
Judge Julie	17	1	Eric Cartman, it is the judgment of this court that you sexually harassed Pip Philip at school.	['sexually']
Cartman	2	0	No way!	[]
Pip	2	0	I won!	[]

Gerald	1	0	Incriminate.	[]
Craig	1	0	Incriminate.	[]
Mr. Garrison	70	0	Okay, children, I'm having a real problem with you all having lawyers. It is really disrupting class time!  Uh huh. Ri-oh, uh oh, I see. Oh, okay. Ri-ight.

Cartman	4	0	Lumpy potatoes?! Oh, no!	[]
Chef	8	0	Sorry, children. All my funding's been cut.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Oh my God! You guys have to do something!	[]
Stan	10	1	Chef, how can we stop all these sexual assment lawsuits?	['sexual']
Chef	19	0	I don't know, children.  Why don't you ask your dad? He's a lawyer, ain't he?	[]
Kyle	21	0	I've tried talking to him, but he doesn't want the lawsuits to stop. He's making too much money.	[]
Chef	13	1	Well, somebody else has got to know all about this sexual harassment whosafudge.	['sexual']
Kyle	6	0	Hey, what about that stupid panda?	[]
Stan	17	1	Yeah, Sexual Harassment Panda. He's the one that started all this. We have to find him!	['sexual']

Barkeep	7	0	Nuhow, Skeeter, he ain't hurtin' nobody.	[]
Petey	73	0	Listen to me: when you sue somebody, it hurts everyone. You sue for money, but where do you think that money comes from? From the schools, from taxes, from the state. From you.  There's no such thing as free money. When you sue somebody, you take money away from parks and schools and charities, and put it in your own pocket. And that makes me a sa-a-a-a-ad panda.	[]
Bearded man	6	0	I'm a sad panda, too.	[]
Man 1	24	1	I'm a really sad panda. I didn't know we were doing all that damage. This is all that damn lawyer's fault!	['damn']
Man 2	6	0	Yeah! Let's sue the lawyer!	[]
All	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Gerald	86	2	No! Don't you see? Th-the panda's right. Boy, what a great message he has! When you sue people, you just end up causing a lot of problems for society. Uhwell, I've really learned something today. All I could see was the millions of dollars coming to me and I didn't care about where the money came from. Well, I'm no longer doing sexual harassment lawsuits in schools! They're too vague and two easily corruptible. Thank you, Sexual Harassment Panda!	['sexual', 'sexual']

Petey/Boys	1	0	Hooray!	[]
Petey	4	0	Pandas love ice cream.	[]
Judge Julie	15	0	Well, seeing as we have no lawyers, I'm throwing the case out. Case dismissed!	[]
Skeeter	13	0	Hey! We don't take too kindly to cases being dismissed around here!	[]
Barkeep	7	2	God damnit, Skeeter, shut the hell up.	['damnit', 'hell']
Petey	65	1	Hello, cubs. I'm Don't Sue People Panda, with an important message for you! Lawsuits damage our society. I know it's tempting to make money, but just remember: that money has to come from somewhere. And usually, it ends up hurting a lot of innocent people. So, until next time, don't let frivolous sexual harassment lawsuits ruin our schools. Good-bye now.	['sexual']
