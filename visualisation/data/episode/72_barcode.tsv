Stan	6	0	So, we meet again, Jennifer Lopez!	[]
Kyle	14	0	No, no, please! This time I swear I won't make albums or movies.	[]
Stan	17	0	That's what you said last time , but obviously we must now resort to more drastic measures	[]
Kyle	7	0	Oh God it burns! It bur-huhurns!	[]
Stan	4	1	Scream for me, bitch!	['bitch']
Kyle	1	0	AAAAAAAH!	[]
"Stan, Kyle"	2	0	Whoa! Awesome!	[]
Cartman	13	0	Ey you guys! You guys! Come 'ere, you guys, come check this out!	[]
Stan	4	0	Oh no, what now?	[]
Cartman	9	0	No, you guys, this is really cool. Come on!	[]
Kyle	6	0	What's this all about, Kenny?	[]
Kenny	11	0	(Wait until you see what I can do to the dog!)	[]
Cartman	23	0	Watch this. It's sooo funny.  Come 'ere, dog, come on.  Good dog.  Red rocket red rocket.  Red rocket. Red rocket.  Come on.	[]
Stan	7	1	Cartman, what the hell are you doing?	['hell']
Cartman	9	0	I'm milking the dog. They make dog milk.	[]
Kyle	4	0	No they don't!	[]
Kenny	3	0	(Yeah they do!)	[]
Cartman	23	0	Yeah, just hold on a minute. The fifth graders showed us how to do it.  Red rocket. Come on, dog, red rocket!  Ohooohhh!	[]
Stan	2	0	Whoa, cool!	[]
Kyle	3	0	That's awesome!	[]
Cartman	4	0	I told you guys.	[]
Stan	10	0	I had no idea dogs made milk; do it again.	[]
Cartman	24	1	Dumbass, you can only milk a dog once every few hours. It doesn't work if you beat off the dog again right away.	['dumbass']
Kyle	3	0	You beat off?	[]
Cartman	20	0	That's what it's called when you milk a dog: beating it off.  Don't you guys know anything?	[]
Stan	9	0	Wow, you learned all this from the fifth graders?	[]
Cartman	23	0	Yeah, I guess they thought we were cool, so they showed us how to do it-hey come here, dog. Dog, come here!	[]
Sharon	17	0	I was really happy with this month's book. I agree with what Bob and Linda said-	[]
Stan	6	0	Mom! Dad! You gotta see this!	[]
Sharon	13	0	Not now, Stanley. This is Mommy and Daddy's book club night, remember?	[]
Stan	5	0	But it's super-cool!	[]
Sharon	11	0	Later, sweetie.  Anyway, I found myself enticed by Steinbeck's imagery.	[]
Man	9	0	Uh the first chapter alone was filled with poetry.	[]
Sharon	9	0	Oh, wasn't it? I mean, the first sentence:	[]
Stan	7	0	Red rocket. Red rocket, Sparky. Red rocket.	[]
Sharon	27	0	Cannery Row in Monterey in California-  -is a poem, a stink, a grating noise...  It's amazing how with three images  he puts you right there, and...	[]
Stan	4	0	Red rocket, red rocket!	[]
Randy	1	0	WAAAH!	[]
Sharon	7	1	Stanley, what the hell are you doing?!	['hell']
Stan	10	0	I'm beating off the dog. Red rocket, red rocket.	[]
Sharon	8	0	STANLEY, YOU GO TO YOUR ROOM RIGHT NOW!	[]
Stan	3	0	My room? Why?	[]
Sharon	11	0	Go, Stanley!  Ahaha, ahem. Heheh, he, he gets very good grades.	[]
Sharon	12	0	Stanley, do you know why you're being grounded for ten months?	[]
Stan	1	0	No!	[]
Randy	23	0	Beating off the dog is not appropriate when we have company!  Ah I mean, ever! Beating off the dog is not appropriate ever!	[]
Stan	6	0	Why?! What's the big deal?!	[]
Sharon	9	0	Stanley, don't you understand what you are doing??	[]
Stan	13	0	I was doing red rocket to make the dog's milk come out.	[]
Randy	12	1	No, Stan! What you were doing to the dog was-ss sexual.	['sexual']
Stan	1	0	Huh??	[]
Sharon	15	0	You were stimulating the dog, Stanley! What came out of him was his... r-Randy?!	[]
Randy	31	0	Well, you know, when you do that to a m-male... the... eh eh you make his... stuff come out.  Well, Jesus, haven't they taught you these things at school?!	[]
Stan	2	0	What things??	[]
Sharon	8	1	Sexual education. Haven't you learned that yet?	['sexual']
Stan	1	0	No!	[]
Sharon	14	0	Oh. Look, well, you see, Stanley,... Well, your school should be teaching this stuff!	[]
Randy	10	1	Yeah! Let's get that damned school on the phone!	['damned']
Principal Victoria	22	0	Okay, parents. I know a lot of you want a chance to speak, but we have to talk one at a time.	[]
Sharon	33	2	Look, our kids are learning sexual things on the street and on television. There's no way we can stop it. The schools have to teach them sexual education at a younger age.	['sexual', 'sexual']
Principal Victoria	13	1	School policy has been to teach sexual education later. In the fifth grade.	['sexual']
Mr. Tweek	5	0	It isn't soon enough.	[]
Stuart	13	0	Yeah. Why, just this afternoon our son was caught beatin' off our dog.	[]
Chef	29	1	Look, parents. Do you really want your children learning about sex? Part of the fun of being a kid is being naive! Let them be kids for a while.	['sex']
Ms. Choksondik	47	2	Naive at what cost, Chef? Parents, we have to face facts: Children in America are having sex at younger and younger ages. STDs are affecting younger and younger kids all the time. The only way we can combat that is by educating children before they have sex.	['sex', 'sex']
Chef	17	2	The first thing that kids learn about sex shouldn't be some bitch-scare tactic about STDs.	['sex', 'bitch']
Sheila	27	1	No, she's right! With all the teen pregnancies that are out today, I think my boy does need to know about sexual education.  From the school.	['sexual']
Adults	7	0	Yeah. Uh huh. Yeah, we have to.	[]
Mr. Mackey	108	6	Okay, boys, this is the first day of sexual education, m'kay? Now, I know that some of you think this is very funny. Words like penis and vagina.  Nuh- now STOP that, m'kay! We're goin' tuh get through this by being mature and grown up, m'kay.  Now, this is the male anatomy, m'kay. Here we see the testes and the scrotum.  STOP that, m'kay! The next person that laughs is gonna get a referral!  M'kay. Now, in order to have intercourse, the man takes his penis, and he... hmmm... uhh...  let's see, the man takes his penis, and he... hm.	['sexual', 'penis', 'vagina', 'scrotum', 'penis', 'penis']
Stan	9	0	Dude, haven't you ever had intercourse, Mr. Mackey?	[]
Mr. Mackey	53	3	Well, sure I have! It's just... I was about 19 at the time, so it's been about 21 years... m'kay. Let's see, uh...  I'm pretty sure I took th-yeah I took the penis, and I bu- uh, what the hell did I do with that damned thing??	['penis', 'hell', 'damned']
Ms. Choksondik	19	0	Alright girls, even though this may be stuff you don't want to hear, you need to hear it.	[]
Wendy	10	0	Oh, we wanna hear it, Ms. Choksondik. We're excited.	[]
Bebe	8	0	Yeah, we think it's gonna be fun!	[]
Girls	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Ms. Choksondik	51	3	Fun! It's going to be fun! Well let's start with our first lesson, then, shall we?  SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES!!  That's right, because unless you get boys to wear condoms you can and will get a sexually transmitted disease from them! How fun is that, hmmm?! Is that fun?	['sexually', 'condoms', 'sexually']
Wendy	5	0	I didn't mean that-	[]
Ms. Choksondik	103	3	Today over 20,000 Americans will contract a sexual disease! TODAY! Twelve thousand more tomorrow! And the reason is that you girls wake up in the morning and say, It's not going to happen to me. You say, Oh, Ms. Choksondik, that happens to girls in Detroit, in Brooklyn, but not here in Colorado. WRONG!  Gonorrhea, herpes, chlamydia, HPV, HIV, syphilis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, the list goes on and on! These are serious diseases! They have serious consequences!  You think that sex is about fun and games and love?  Wrong! Sex is about disease! Here's a little picture of herpes.	['sexual', 'sex', 'sex']
Girls	1	0	AAAHHH!	[]
Ms. Choksondik	8	0	And here's a little syphilis for you!	[]
Girls	1	0	AAAHHH!	[]
Ms. Choksondik	17	1	That's right, girls. Here's what happens when you don't get boys to use condoms!	['condoms']
Chef	3	0	Hello there, children.	[]
Boys	2	0	Hey Chef.	[]
Chef	6	1	How is sexual education class going?	['sexual']
Stan	10	0	It's dumb. Mr. Mackey doesn't teach us nothin'.	[]
Chef	28	0	Yeah, I don't think Ol' Mackey knows a hymen from a hysterectomy. And Choksondik? I'd be surprised if she's ever gotten laid in her life.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Yeah... Chef, what's laid?	[]
Chef	12	0	...Oh, nothin'. Now, move along, children, you're holdin' up the line.	[]
Kyle	13	1	Hey! Maybe we should ask the girls what they learned in sex ed.	['sex']
Stan	7	0	Yeah.  Hey Wendy, did you guys get-	[]
Girls	1	0	AAAAHHH!	[]
Kyle	7	1	What the hell is wrong with them?	['hell']
Stan	8	0	You guys, we just wanna know if you-	[]
Girls	1	0	AAAAHHH!	[]
Wendy	5	0	Stay away from me, Stan!	[]
Stan	1	0	Why?	[]
Wendy	5	1	Are you wearing a condom?	['condom']
Stan	2	0	...A what?	[]
Girls	1	0	AAAAHHH!	[]
Bebe	8	1	Do any of you have your condoms on?	['condoms']
Kyle	1	0	No.	[]
Girls	1	0	AAAAHHH!	[]
Wendy	14	1	Don't you know that without wearing a condom you could get a disease?	['condom']
Kyle	2	0	Nuh uh.	[]
Bebe	14	1	Yuh huh! If you don't wear a condom, you're gonna get AIDS.	['condom']
Cartman	1	0	AIDS?	[]
Butters	11	0	Oh, jeez. Ah I don't wanna get the AIDS, fellas.	[]
Kyle	8	1	Is that what you learned in sex ed?	['sex']
Cartman	8	0	Mr. Mackey didn't say nothin' about that.	[]
Stan	9	0	Dude, Mr. Mackey didn't know anything about anything.	[]
Wendy	18	1	You guys have to wear condoms. Now, please, just, just go away. We don't want your AIDS.	['condoms']
Stan	8	0	But Wendy, we don't understand how that-	[]
Girls	1	0	AAAAHHH!	[]
Kyle	4	0	Oh my God, dude.	[]
Butters	7	0	Uh what are we gonna do, huh?	[]
Stan	7	1	Dude, we gotta go get condoms quick.	['condoms']
Boys	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Pharmacist	5	0	Can I help you boys?	[]
Stan	4	1	Yeah, we need condoms!	['condoms']
Pharmacist	1	1	Condoms?	['condoms']
Kyle	2	0	Yeah. Quick!	[]
Pharmacist	5	0	How old are you boys?	[]
Stan	4	0	Why does that matter?	[]
Butters	7	0	Ha-I'll be nine next week.	[]
Pharmacist	8	1	Sorry, kids, I'm not selling you condoms.	['condoms']
Kyle	9	0	Well why not? You want us to get AIDS?	[]
Pharmacist	10	0	I just don't think kids your age should be-	[]
Assistant	14	1	Mark, we have to be willing to supply condoms to anyone who requests them.	['condoms']
Mark	4	0	But... they're... children!	[]
Assistant	7	0	Would you rather them do it unprotected?	[]
Cartman	6	1	Yeah, you want us unprotected, asshole?!	['asshole']
Mark	16	2	I just think that all this sex ed and condom talk in elementary school is wrong!	['sex', 'condom']
Assistant	20	0	Kids are going to do what they do, and it's up to us to make sure they're protected.	[]
Stan	10	0	Well, I'm glad this lady's on our side.	[]
Mark	12	0	I don't think we have any that'll even fit them!	[]
Assistant	35	0	Sure we do. We just got in the new Gladiators for kids. 'Lil Mini's. They're specially designed for kids under 10, and they're only five ninety five for a box of fifty.	[]
Butters	12	0	Fifty?? Uh, can't we just use the same one every day?	[]
Assistant	6	0	No, you have to change it.	[]
Kyle	12	0	Oh, jeez, we're gonna have to buy tons of these things.	[]
Mr. Mackey	11	0	Uh thanks so much for letting me come over, Ms. Choksondik.	[]
Ms. Choksondik	20	0	Oh, it's no problem, Mr. Mackey. It's probably best we come up with a lesson plan together anyway.	[]
Mr. Mackey	36	0	Yeah I've already gone over most of the basics, you know, uh with the boys, but I uh... eh just wanted to see what else you were teaching the girls, in case I... missed anything.	[]
Ms. Choksondik	28	1	Well we should make sure our students are good and scared of the consequences. We have to teach them that diseases are possible even with just oral sex.	['sex']
Mr. Mackey	8	1	Right! Oral sex, which of course would be...	['sex']
Ms. Choksondik	8	2	Using your mouth on the penis or vagina.	['penis', 'vagina']
Mr. Mackey	8	3	Penis or vagina, right. Oral sex, m'kay.	['penis', 'vagina', 'sex']
Ms. Choksondik	12	1	It's just too bad these girls are having sex so young.	['sex']
Mr. Mackey	6	0	Yeah, why d-uh, did you?	[]
Ms. Choksondik	3	0	Did I what?	[]
Mr. Mackey	12	0	Well uh, how long did you wait before you had... uh... doobers.	[]
Ms. Choksondik	92	0	Well, if you must know, I'm still somewhat of a virgin.  But I'm not ashamed of it! I wasn't sought after much in high school or college.  I was made fun of most of my life for having such large glasses.  The only boyfriend I ever had was this attractive popular boy named Steven Garrett. I liked him very much, but I... found out that he was dating me because he lost a bet on the Super Bowl. The loser had to go out with me for three days.	[]
Mr. Mackey	6	0	Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.	[]
Ms. Choksondik	13	0	People can be very cruel. Anyway, I know it's hard to understand.	[]
Mr. Mackey	54	0	Ah actually I understand perfectly. I... I wasn't exactly the captain of the football team, either, huh huh, hehehuh,  anyhow  And then as I got older my... my head just sorta seemed to get bigger while the rest of my body stayed the same. That's how I got my nickname in college.	[]
Ms. Choksondik	2	0	Your nickname?	[]
Mr. Mackey	7	0	That guy with the really big head.	[]
Ms. Choksondik	1	0	...Right.	[]
Mr. Mackey	21	0	Anyway, I... I sort of lost any confidence and found it impossible to ever ask a woman out, mm, hm mm.	[]
Ms. Choksondik	14	1	Wow, I've... never met a man who is... as sexually unappealing as me.	['sexually']
Mr. Mackey	3	0	Neither have I.	[]
Ms. Choksondik	21	1	Well, I'm quite happy without sex. I mean, with all the diseases and problems out there, who needs it, right?	['sex']
Mr. Mackey	5	0	Uh not me!  Huhuh, okay.	[]
Ms. Choksondik	7	0	Well, back to the lesson plan, then.	[]
Mr. Mackey	1	0	Right.	[]
Ms. Choksondik	3	1	Okay.  Oral Sex	['sex']
Stan	7	0	Doesn't it give any other directions?	[]
Butters	27	2	Nope. It looks like you're just supposed to roll it over your wiener.  If used properly, latex condoms are effective against pregnancy, AIDS and other studzes	['wiener', 'condoms']
Kyle	4	0	Uh, what are studzes	[]
Butters	18	0	How the heck should I know?  Why, it's just a little doughnut.  Hoh- it's all gooey.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Just put it on, Butters.	[]
Butters	8	0	Ha-a how come I gotta go first?	[]
Cartman	7	0	Butters, will you stop ff-fili-bustering?	[]
Butters	16	0	Ma-a-a-a-a-a alright, man.  O-o-o-o-h, it's sticky.	[]
Kyle	10	0	It says you gotta check it for holes or tears.	[]
Butters	13	0	I don't even understand how this thing... ooh, wait. Oh, I see.	[]
Stan	7	1	Don't look at Butters' schlong, gaymo!	['gaymo']
Cartman	16	1	I wasn't looking as his schlong, I was seeing how to put the condom on!	['condom']
Kyle	1	0	Sure.	[]
Butters	14	0	But it won't stay on. I- I need a rubber band or somethin'.	[]
Tweek	5	0	Ah, I got rubber bands.	[]
Butters	13	0	Ow! Huhuh, ow! Okay, eh.  Ow! There. Okay, I think it's on.	[]
Stan	4	0	How do you feel?	[]
Butters	2	0	...Pretty good.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Do you feel protected?	[]
Butters	32	1	Yeah, there ain't nothin' that's gettin' in my wiener through this thing? A-and it's even got a little reservoir at the end so you can... pee in it.	['wiener']
Stan	19	1	Alright, here, everybody.  Tweek, give everyone a rubber band. Hey, somebody's gotta help Timmy put his condom on.	['condom']
Timmy	1	0	Timmehah!	[]
Principal Victoria	42	2	Teachers, I have some bad news. Last night I received a phone call from the local pharmacist. Apparently, almost all of our fourth graders are sexually active. And now that we've scared them a little they're buying condoms to use.	['sexually', 'condoms']
Ms. Choksondik	34	0	I knew it! Well, at least we scared them enough to protect themselves. But now maybe you'll believe me when I say that we need to be teaching even younger than fourth grade.	[]
Principal Victoria	17	1	But how old do you think a student should be when they learn about proper condom use?	['condom']
Ms. Choksondik	1	0	...Kindergarten.	[]
Chef	1	0	Kindergarten?!	[]
Ms. Choksondik	16	1	We've got to get to the students before they start having... sex. Nu-not after.	['sex']
Chef	6	0	Aw, now this is getting ridiculous!	[]
Mr. Adler	24	0	I have to agree with Ms. Choksondik. It's our responsibility to make sure our kids are safe if they're gonna screw around.	[]
Principal Victoria	6	0	I guess we have no choice.	[]
Mr. Garrison	12	1	Okay, children, who can tell me what a condom is?  Yes, Jenny?	['condom']
Jenny	7	0	It flies around and it's endangered.	[]
Mr. Garrison	22	0	That's a con-dor, Jenny. Con-dor.  Con-doms are what we use to stop the spread of STDs.  Yes, Filmore?	[]
Filmore	4	0	Can we do fingerpaint?	[]
Mr. Garrison	74	3	NO, we can't do fingerpaint! You kids wanna get herpes?! Huh?! How about a nice bucket of AIDS?! Sound good?! Now pay attention, alright? I'm going to show you the proper way to put on a condom.  First of all you remove the condom from its package.  Then you find which way the condom rolls out.  Put it in your mouth...  And apply.  And it's as simple as that. Any questions?	['condom', 'condom', 'condom']
Ms. Choksondik	77	1	Alright girls. Yesterday we went over the myriad of diseases you can get from boys, but today we're going to talk about the most horrible they can give you of all.  PREGNANCY!  That's right, since you girls have decided to be sexually active, teen pregnancy is at an all-time high! You seem to think it's gonna be fun and neat to have a baby-well, let's watch a little video, shall we?!	['sexually']
Narrator	23	0	Snacky S'mores presents: The Miracle of Child Birth.  The time is drawing close for delivery. Here we can see the water breaking.	[]
Girls	1	0	Eeeeww.	[]
Narrator	53	1	Later, the contractions are happening closer together. Mom sure is in a lot of pain. Now we can see the crown of the baby's head, stretching the vaginal walls in ways never before thought possible by Mom. Finally, the miracle happens, and the baby is born.  but Mom's not done yet.	['vaginal']
Girl	1	0	Eeww.	[]
Narrator	10	0	She still got some afterbirth to push out of her.	[]
Girls	1	0	AAAAAAAA!!!!	[]
Narrator	3	0	That's right.	[]
Ms. Choksondik	6	0	Girls! Girls! Where are you going?!	[]
Stan	7	1	Man, this condom's driving me crazy.	['condom']
Kyle	13	0	Yeah. I've changed mine three times already 'cause it itches so much.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Yeah, but it makes going to the bathroom easier.	[]
Mr. Mackey	41	2	Alright, boys, I now have all the information I need to teach you the female anatomy, hm'kay.  M'kay, this part here is the vaginal opening.  This is where the man puts his- Eric, what the hell are you doing?	['vaginal', 'hell']
Cartman	13	1	I'm putting on a new condom. I filled the other one up.	['condom']
Mr. Mackey	6	1	Why are you wearing a condom?	['condom']
Cartman	6	0	So I don't get AIDS.	[]
Mr. Mackey	17	1	Eric, you can't get AIDS from just sitting around, you have to get it from sex.	['sex']
Stan	2	1	From sex??	['sex']
Mr. Mackey	1	0	Yes.	[]
Kyle	6	0	You mean, intercourse with a girl?	[]
Mr. Mackey	29	1	Yes! Now will you all pay attention, please?! The vagina and the clitoris are on the outside, and they are in fact very easily visible to the naked eye.	['vagina']
Stan	11	0	All this time... It's the girls that give us diseases!	[]
Cartman	11	0	I knew it! Girls lie! They lie right to your face!	[]
Mr. Mackey	20	0	Now here we can see the interior female anatomy. Things like the uterus and the ovaries are on the inside	[]
Kyle	19	0	Well that does it! If us boys are going to live, we have to get rid of the girls!	[]
Stan	7	0	Yeah, come on guys, this is war!	[]
Boys	6	0	Yeah! That's right! Come on!	[]
Mr. Mackey	18	0	And here we see the tender, magical uterus. Here we see the enticing, voluptuous Fallopian tubes, m'kay.	[]
Mr. Garrison	20	2	Okay, children, now I wanna review the different sexual positions. Who can tell me which sexual positions we talked about?	['sexual', 'sexual']
Filmore	3	0	Miss'nary position?	[]
Mr. Garrison	12	0	Missionary position, good. A little boring, but tried and true. What else?	[]
Girl	1	0	Doggie?	[]
Mr. Garrison	9	0	That's right. Doggie style we went over, mhm.	[]
Boy	2	0	Pile driver?	[]
Mr. Garrison	7	0	Uh huh, pile driver position. Good, Quaid.	[]
Sally	3	0	The Filthy Sanchez?	[]
Mr. Garrison	8	0	Yes, good Flora, you remembered the Filthy Sanchez.	[]
Boy 2	2	0	Hot Karl?	[]
Mr. Garrison	11	0	Yes,you can give your partner the ol' Hot Karl, sure.	[]
Clyde	15	0	There, you see? The girls have built some kind of stronghold to keep us out.	[]
Wendy	11	1	Stay away from us, bastards! We don't wanna get pregnant!	['bastards']
Bebe	9	0	Yeah! Just take your diseases and go away forever!	[]
Stan	5	0	Ha! They're your diseases!	[]
Kyle	6	0	Yeah! You get out of town!	[]
Cartman	5	0	Here, talk to them, Butters.	[]
Butters	11	0	Uh, me?? Huh, what the heck am I supposed to say?	[]
Cartman	17	0	Just tell them that if they leave town peacefully, we won't have to resort to violence.	[]
Butters	23	0	Just walk away. You can put a stop to all this. Just walk away and we will spare your lives. Just walk away.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Man, he's pretty good.	[]
Bebe	6	0	We'll never walk away. Never!	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Waa-ooo!)	[]
Cartman	2	1	Oh, bitch!	['bitch']
Stan	4	0	That does it! Attack!	[]
Mr. Mackey	20	0	M'kay, so apparently the lesson plan tomorrow is s'posed to involve the secretion of bodily fluids, m'kay.	[]
Ms. Choksondik	17	0	I've already gone through that with the girls.  It's pretty simple. Do you wanna drink?	[]
Mr. Mackey	25	0	Why, sure.  Hey uh I think I can... get through that stuff pretty quick, mm...  Uh, maybe we should come up with another lesson plan.	[]
Ms. Choksondik	11	0	Something about how nerve endings play an important part in intercourse.	[]
Mr. Mackey	8	0	Uh, right, right, uh, like in the ...nipples.	[]
Ms. Choksondik	6	1	Or the... shaft... of the penis?	['penis']
Mr. Mackey	18	1	It... says here that the uh, head of the penis is actually the... most sensitive... part, m'kay.	['penis']
Ms. Choksondik	24	1	Why, yes. The nerve endings are the most concentrated at- the- tip of the penis. Like they are in the...  clitoris of the woman.	['penis']
Mr. Mackey	9	0	And these... are the two areas most important to-	[]
Ms. Choksondik	6	1	Sexual stimulation.  Oh, is this wrong?	['sexual']
Mr. Mackey	19	0	I don't know. It doesn't feel wrong.  I've been thinking about you a lot, Ms. Choksondik.	[]
Ms. Choksondik	10	0	Yeah? What do you do when you think about me?	[]
Mr. Mackey	3	0	I go crazy.	[]
Ms. Choksondik	4	0	Do you touch yourself?	[]
Mr. Mackey	2	0	Yeah. Hmm.	[]
Ms. Choksondik	2	0	Haawww. Haawww.	[]
Mr. Mackey	4	0	G'oh, m'kay.	[]
Ms. Choksondik	8	0	Oh my God. Oh God, yeah! Stop! Stop!	[]
Mr. Mackey	4	0	Huh, what's wrong?	[]
Ms. Choksondik	4	0	It's your turn.	[]
Mr. Mackey	7	0	Mm, oh, oh Ms. Choksondik. Okay! Okay!	[]
Ms. Choksondik	4	0	Do you want me?	[]
Mr. Mackey	2	0	I do.	[]
Ms. Choksondik	2	0	Tell me.	[]
Mr. Mackey	5	0	I want you. M'kay.	[]

Cartman	8	0	Ooo, Butters? You're in big trouble now.	[]
Sharon	16	0	Well, I don't know what got into you kids. You should be ashamed of yourselves.	[]
Stan	10	0	We just didn't want the girls giving us diseases.	[]
Ms. Choksondik	37	1	I'm afraid this is all my fault. I... think I went a little overboard scaring the girls. I forgot to tell them that to get diseases from boys you... have to have sex with them first.	['sex']
Kids	1	0	Oooohhh.	[]
Chef	13	0	Well, I hate to say it, but you all got what you deserved.	[]
Parents	1	0	Huh?	[]
Chef	91	4	Look: Schools are teaching condom use to younger and younger students each day! But sex isn't something that should be taught in textbooks and diagrams. Sex is emotional and spiritual. It needs to be taught by family. I know it can be hard, parents, but if you leave it up to the schools to teach sex to kids, you don't know who they're learning it from. It could be from someone who doesn't know,  someone who has a bad opinion of it,  or even a complete pervert.	['condom', 'sex', 'sex', 'sex']

Chef	3	0	Nope, just 17.	[]
Gerald	9	0	But, what if you're not ready at 17?	[]
Chef	4	0	Seventeen! You're ready.	[]
Stan	20	1	Well, I guess we got a while to wait before we have to worry about sex and diseases, huh, Wendy?	['sex']
