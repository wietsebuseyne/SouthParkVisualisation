Siimon	4	0	Heh What? Dad? Huh?	[]
Mr. Hankey	2	0	Nothin', Simon.	[]
Kyle	15	0	A family! So THAT's why you haven't been able to spread Christmas cheer.	[]
Mr. Hankey	12	0	It sure has been tough. Nobody seems that into Christmas out there.	[]
Stan	10	0	I know, it's like it doesn't matter anymore.	[]
Cartman	9	0	My moms barely bought me any presents so far.	[]

Tele's Owner	42	1	Well, it was a good effort, boys. But I'm gonna have to close shop. Nobody's buyin' anything an' I can't afford to keep this furnace runnin'!  Oh. And, boys, there's some crap on the sidewalk there. Watch out.	['crap']
Red	16	0	Not one toy. I guess this yeear, everyone's content to celebrate with candles and love.	[]
Stan	19	0	This is hopeless. We're just gonna have to face that the commercialism has been sucked out of Christmas.	[]
News Anchor	53	1	And in other news tonight it appears that everyone is officially SICK OF CHRISTMAS!  In an SPC poll, 38% said they were fed up and tired of the holiday, 5% said they were indifferent to it, and a whopping 57% they would quick Bon Jovi square in the balls if given the opportunity.	['balls']
Ms. Choksondik	29	0	Well, I think people are just fed up with the crowded shopping and the credit-card bills, uh.  I, I think that the holiday just has become a joke.	[]
Man	27	0	You know, it's just that a lot of people don't really believe in the whole Jesus thing anymore, you know? So what's to celebrate?	[]
Man 2	12	2	Oh yeah. Right in the balls, man. Right square in the balls.	['balls', 'balls']

Charlie Brown	10	0	Good Grief! We need a Christmas tree for our play.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Oh, Jesus, not this thing again.	[]
Stan	9	0	How come everyone in cartoons has such big heads?	[]
Charlie	11	0	Alright, everyone, we've got to get on with our play!	[]
Kyle	10	0	Jesus, this sucks! All they keep doin' is dancing around!	[]
Cartman	10	0	Yeah, this thing really falls apart in the second act.	[]
Stan	13	0	And why is it that on Charlie Brown cartoons, everyone talks like this.	[]
Cartman	10	0	My mom could make a better Christmas special than this!	[]
Kyle	15	0	Hey, that's it. Oh, my God, that's totally it!  It's so simple!	[]
Stan	2	0	What, dude?	[]
Kyle	24	0	We can get everyone back into the Christmas spirit by making our very own animated Christmas special, and showing it to everybody in town!	[]
Stan	7	0	We don't know anything about animation.	[]
Kyle	8	0	How hard can it be? Look at it.	[]
Cartman	24	0	Hey yeah! We can make a little animated Santa Claus and Jesus, and it can star us instead of these little round-headed guys!	[]
Kenny	3	0	(Yeah, right! Awesome!)	[]
Stan	10	0	Yeah! And we can call it... The Spirit of Christmas	[]

Mayor	17	0	An animated Christmas card. Kids, that just may be the dumbest idea I've ever heard, ever!	[]
The Boys	1	0	Awww.	[]
Mayor	19	0	But at this point I'm willing to try anything. Johnson, cut them a check for three hundred dollars.	[]

Hi there, Santa. I am the Light and the Way, and stuff.  Uh, ho o-kay. That's good, I suppose. Huh, and here's the cutout versions of you guys.	['ho', 'ho', 'ho', 'ho']
The boys	1	0	Whoa!	[]
Cartman	7	1	Heheh. Look, he made Stan all fat.	['fat']
Stan	7	0	That's not me, that's you!	[]
Cartman	1	0	What?!	[]
Kyle	28	0	They kind of look like us.  I mean, Stan's got blue eyes and I've got a sharper nose, but I mean, they kinda look like us.	[]
Cartman	6	2	I AM NOT THAT GODDAMNED FAT!	['goddamned', 'fat']
Kyle	3	0	God job, Butters.	[]
Butters	22	0	Woh, ah, hey! I made a little cutout version of me, too! Ih in case you need it for your animated film.	[]
Stan	4	0	No, that's okay.	[]
Kyle	2	0	See ya!	[]
Butters	44	1	Uh-m, alright, alright then.  Oh, uh, hello, good-lookin'? What's your name?  Huh, Butters, ma'am.   Well, Butters, would you like to slap my- titties around?  Whoa! Well, uhuh  Uh, no thanks, ma'am. Uh I, I'll get in trouble again.	['titties']
Mr. Hankey	11	0	Cornwallis, we've got to go fix up the drive-in.	[]
Cornwallis	10	0	I don't want to, Dad. I'm too sad.	[]
Mr. Hankey	16	0	Hey, that's alright, Cornwallis. The boys' animated movie will being back the spirit of Christmas.	[]
Cornwallis	19	0	It's not that, father. Its... Well, I don't feel like I'm really a part of Christmas.	[]
Mr. Hankey	9	0	But son, you're a Hankey. We love Christmas!	[]
Autumn	10	0	Come on, it's time to sit around the tree!	[]
Mr. Hankey	6	0	We're having a talk, honey.	[]
Autumn	16	1	God-damnit it's Christmas and we're gonna be a happy family around the tree!	['damnit']
Mr. Hankey	19	0	Autumn, you're drunk. Alright, now, just go help the other kids; they can't get their stockings up.	[]
Autumn	13	0	That's not the only thing that can't get up around here.	[]
Mr. Hankey	9	0	...Now come on, son. Don't be so down.	[]
Cornwallis	12	1	Why? We're just pieces of crap. Christmas isn't for us.	['crap']
Mr. Hankey	9	0	Christmas is about feeling good. That's for everybody!	[]
Cornwallis	29	2	I see the Nativity. There's angels, shepherds and sheep. But no poo. All the Christmas movies: Santa, elves, reindeer. No poo. I'm not a part of it.	['poo', 'poo']
Mr. Hankey	18	0	No, you're not a part of it, Cornwallis. You're all of it. Don't you see?	[]
Cornwallis	5	1	I'm nothing but crap!	['crap']
Mr. Hankey	204	7	But crap is everything.  Everything that lives on earth poos in some way And that's how the cycle happens, each and every day Just look at the green green grass and the birds up in the sky It's all here because of poo, and now I'll tell you why Grass it's eaten by cattle, which is eaten by women and men It fuses with their bodies and becomes poo again And that poo goes through the sewer, where it's dumped into the sea. And it's eaten by the plankton, and becomes the fishes' meal. And then that bigger fish with the poo still inside Swims up near the shore and gets eaten alive By the grizzly bear that poos on a dead piece of sand So it can spring to life and become food for the land! It's the poo of the antelope, the poo of the giraffe It falls onto the earth and becomes the blades of grass ''The grass is eaten by the cattle, which comes out the other end To make food for the humans and start all over again You see, son? You're not an insignificant part of life. You are life.	['crap', 'poo', 'poo', 'poo', 'poo', 'poo', 'poo']
Cornwallis	21	0	But how can I be that giraffe and blade of grass, and a human? I don't control what they do.	[]
Mr. Hankey	38	0	Just like your heart beats without you thinking about it, so, too, your giraffes and your humans do what they do without you even thinkin' about it. But it is all one life form. It is all...  you.	[]
Cornwallis	18	1	I think I see now. I'm the poo of the antelope, that flows down to the ground	['poo']
Mr. Hankey	5	0	Becomes the grass of tomorrow	[]
Cornwallis	1	0	Yeah	[]
Mr. Hankey	5	0	Which the grazers turn around	[]
Cornwallis	14	0	So I'm the leg of a leopard and the wings of a hen	[]
"Mr. Hankey, Cornwallis"	20	2	Which becomes dinner for the human and turns back to poo again. That's the Circle, the Circle of Poo!	['poo', 'poo']
Stan	12	0	Okay, here's the script. But it doesn't have an ending.	[]
Kyle	28	0	No ending? Well, we can't animate until we have our voices recorded, so we'd better just record what we have and figure out the ending later.	[]
Sound man	14	0	Okay, talk directly in the mike and don't hit any hard p's.	[]
Kyle	5	0	What's a hard p?	[]
Cartman	14	0	You know, first thing in the morning when it just won't come out?	[]

Mr. Hankey	13	0	It's my fault. All my fault. I got everyone's hopes up.	[]
Cornwallis	7	0	But Dad, we can fix the projector.	[]
Mr. Hankey	27	1	Aw, it's too late for that, son. everyone' gone home. And I don't know nothin' about projectors. I'm just a stupid piece of crap.	['crap']
Cornwallis	14	1	Dad, you taught me an important lesson: That crap is the cycle of everything.	['crap']
Mr. Hankey	19	1	Aw, that was just a stupid song, Cornwallis! I was jus' tryin' to get you to stop your bitchin'	['bitchin']
Cornwallis	40	0	No, it wasn't a stupid song. Because you showed me that I have the power and the strength to do anything I want. You made me believe in myself, Dad! Now I'm asking you to do the same.	[]
