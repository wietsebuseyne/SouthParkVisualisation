Stan	6	1	Hey, who's that fat chick?	['fat']
Kyle	10	0	Sally Struthers, dude. She used to be on Full House.	[]
Stan	1	0	Oh.	[]
Sally Struthers	12	0	You see, here, in the middle of Africa, food is extremely scarce.	[]
Stan	11	0	Doesn't look like she's having any trouble finding food.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Yeah, she's fatter than Cartman.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Yeah, HEY!	[]
Sally Struthers	11	0	For just five dollars a month you can sponsor a child.	[]

Kyle	2	1	Ass-raper.	['ass']
Stan	9	0	Yeah? Yeah. We want to adopt a starving Ethernopian.	[]
Cartman	7	0	When do we get the sports watch?	[]
Stan	5	2	Just a second fat-ass!	['fat', 'ass']
Cartman	3	0	You vas-deferens!	[]
Stan	9	0	Hello? No, no, it's a ma- Vas-deferens?	[]
Kenny	8	0	(Dude, it's a pipe for your peepee)	[]
Stan	1	0	Oh.	[]
Kyle	9	0	Ask her if we get the watch right away.	[]
Stan	12	0	Do we get the sports watch right away?  She says we do.	[]
All	1	0	Cool.	[]
Cartman	8	0	I get to wear it first, you guys.	[]
Kyle	15	0	I can't wait to get out of school and get our Teiko sports watch.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Yeah, but I get to wear it first, I said.	[]
Mr. Garrison	28	0	Children, children! To honor this special time of year we'll be doing a canned food drive. Does anybody know what a canned food drive is?  Yes, Eric?	[]
Cartman	13	0	When they cut up a chick's stomach to get a baby out?	[]
Mr. Garrison	41	0	Noo, that's a Caesarian Section Eric, but that's okay, remember, there are no stupid questions, just stupid people.  A canned food drive is when we collect canned food for poor people who can't afford to eat on Thanksgiving.	[]
Stan	4	0	You mean, like Kenny?	[]
Mr. Garrison	1	0	Exactly.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Mr. Garrison? Why do poor people always smell like sour milk?	[]
Mr. Garrison	41	0	I don't know Eric, they just do.  Now children, I want each of you to bring in one can of food. And later, the mayor of South Park will divide it up amongst Kenny's family and other poor people.	[]
Cartman	11	0	I'm not bringin' in food for poor people, Screw them!	[]
Wendy	11	0	Don't you want to help those who are less fortunate?!	[]
Cartman	16	0	Hey you guys, do you hear something?! Ah- I think I hear the flower children calling!	[]
Wendy	18	0	This is the one time of year you're supposed to care about people who can't eat!	[]
Cartman	18	0	Isn't it enough that I pay taxes?! What about the poor houses that, that I pay for?!	[]
Wendy	9	0	Many would rather die than go to those places!	[]
Cartman	10	0	Well then, perhaps they should, and decrease the surplus population!	[]
Mr. Garrison	19	1	Okay kids, that's enough Dickens for one day. Let's get on with our lesson, right Mr. Hat?	['dickens']
Mr. Hat	18	0	That's right, Mr. Garrison, Englebert Humperdink was the first person on the moon, who was the second?	[]
Clyde	1	0	Aaaah!	[]
Mr. Garrison	6	1	What the hell is going on?!	['hell']
Clyde	1	0	Aaaah!	[]
Mr. Garrison	7	0	Well, you don't see that everyday.	[]
The Mayor	22	0	Okay. Now, once we have all the canned foods collected we'll need some clever way to distribute them to the poor.	[]
Aide 2	5	0	It should be something festive.	[]
Mephesto	8	0	Mayor, we've got a very big problem.	[]
The Mayor	13	0	Ahh, you're that insane genetic engineer from up on the hill, right?	[]
Mephesto	18	0	Yes, and I may have made a horrible mistake. I was trying to genetically engineer turkeys for Thanksgiving.	[]
The Mayor	2	0	Uh huh.	[]
Mephesto	8	0	You know, to provide food for the needy.	[]
The Mayor	2	0	Of course.	[]
Mephesto	19	0	Well, something went wrong and the turkeys broke free. And the worst part is, they're REALLY pissed off.	[]
The Mayor	5	0	Naturally.  Oh, do go on.	[]
Mephesto	14	0	We have to stop them or, or they could destroy everything. Time is short.	[]
The Mayor	3	0	You were saying?	[]
Mephesto	10	0	They act just like normal turkeys, except they're evil.	[]
The Mayor	2	0	Oh, my!	[]
Mephesto	10	0	Somehow I don't think you're taking me seriously.	[]
The Mayor	7	0	Uh now why would you say that?	[]
Everybody	10	0	Did it come? Did it come? Is it here yet?	[]
Cartman	16	0	I get to use it first you guys!  Mom, did our digital sports watch come yet?	[]
Liane	3	0	Not yet hon.	[]
Stan	1	1	Damn.	['damn']
Kyle	4	0	Hey, look you guys.	[]
TV Announcer	13	0	And now, back to Part 2 of the Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special .	[]
Terrance	5	0	I sure am cold, Phillip.	[]
Phillip	10	1	Yes, and hungry too. Being a pilgrim totally sucks ass.	['ass']
Terrance	7	0	Gosh, I hope we don't starve.	[]
Phillip	3	0	Ah, a squeaker!	[]
Kyle	6	0	The digital sports watch is here.	[]
Cartman	3	1	What the hell?	['hell']
Stan	8	0	Dude, that's not a digital sports watch.	[]
Kyle	8	0	Hey, it looks like one of those Etheropians.	[]
Stan	13	0	Oh man, they must have accidentally sent him instead of the sports watch.	[]
Kyle	18	0	Maybe they took it literally when we said we wanted to adopt a kid.  Whoa! That was cool.	[]
Stan	8	0	Yeah, how did he make those clicking sounds?	[]
Kyle	5	0	What's your name dude?	[]
Kid	1	0	Mabin.	[]
Stan	8	0	I think he said his name is Marvin.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Yeah, Starvin' Marvin.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Nice to meet you Starvin' Marvin.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Hey mooom?	[]
Liane	2	0	Yes hon?	[]
Cartman	8	0	We found a Etheropian, can we keep him?	[]
Liane	2	0	Sure, hon.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Sweet.	[]
Stan	8	0	Dude, let's bring him to school tomorrow.	[]
Kyle	12	0	Come on Starvin' Marvin, I want you to meet my little brother.	[]
Cartman	9	0	No no! He's my son! I adopted him.	[]
Stan	7	0	It was my mom's credit card.	[]
Kyle	21	0	Okay, okay, wewe'll switch off. Starvin' Marvin can stay here for a week, then at Stan's, then with me.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Yeah, and never with Kenny, because his family is too poor.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Totally.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Ahh!	[]
Woman	17	0	Look how the leaves fall so delicately on the surface of the pond. It's so beautiful.	[]
Man	5	0	Not as beautiful as you.	[]
Woman	1	0	Ooooh.	[]
Man	5	0	Oh darling, look. Thanksgiving turkeys.	[]
Woman	5	0	Oohh, they're so beautiful.	[]
Man	5	0	Not as beautiful as you.	[]
Woman	14	0	Look at the way they foam at the mouth, like beautiful suds of beer.	[]
Man	4	0	Not as beautiful as-	[]
Stan	23	0	This is a great way for you to experience America Starvin' Marvin. This is what we call an 'all you can eat buffet.'	[]
Cartman	60	0	Yeah. Here you get to eat all you want for only $6.99. That's why we all come here on Tuesday nights, except for Kenny's family 'cause to them $6.99 is two-years income.  Why is your family poor Starvin' Marvin? Is your dad an alcoholic too?  You see Starvin' Marvin, these are what we call appetizers.	[]
Marvin	3	0	Ap-ee-tizer.	[]
Cartman	23	0	This is what you eat before you eat, to make you more hungry.  Welp, food is here, that's it for the appetizers.	[]
Cartman	8	0	No Starvin' Marvin, that's my pot-pie.	[]
Stan	15	1	Cartman, you butt-pipe, this is the time of year you're supposed to share.	['butt']
Cartman	45	0	Oh yeah, you're right.  Are you gonna eat all of your peach cobbler? No, you don't want all that, why don't you share it with me, man?  Just slide that right on over here. Let me just have some of that here...	[]
Mr. Garrison	83	0	Children, children! I'm a little disappointed in your Thanksgiving spirit. Only a few cans have been donated to our canned food drive.  And can't we do a little better than ... Creamed Corn ... uh ... Creamed Corn ... and ... Creamed Corn?  Please bring in more diverse food children or else Kenny's family is going to have a pretty corny Thanksgiving.  Corny...Gravy...Corny Thanksgiving, hoo. Hahhaa. Anyway children, I understand a few of you have brought in something special for show-and-tell.	[]
Stan	4	0	Yeah, yeah, we do!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Yeah, that's right.	[]
Kyle	2	0	We do!	[]
Mr. Garrison	9	0	All right boys, show us what you've brought.	[]
Kyle	7	0	This is our new Ethernopian, Starvin' Marvin.	[]
Stan	13	0	He can do really cool stuff with his voice. Show 'em Starvin' Marvin.	[]
Cartman	18	0	No, Starvin' Marvin, that's Kenny's creamed corn.  No Starvin' Marvin, that's a bad Starvin' Marvin!	[]
Mr. Garrison	18	1	Boys, what the hell are you doing?! This is horribly, horribly wrong. How did you get this child?	['hell']
Stan	11	0	He was accidentally delivered to us instead of a sports watch.	[]
Mr. Garrison	6	0	The sports watch from the commercial?	[]
Kyle	3	0	Yeah, that one.	[]
Bebe	5	0	I want a Starvin' Marvin.	[]
Clyde	2	0	Me too.	[]
Pip	8	0	Yes, I'll pay fifty dollars for one.	[]
Class	8	0	Yeah, I want one too, yeah me, me.	[]
Mr. Garrison	28	0	Boys, you're too young to take care of a child! I'm afraid I'm going to have to call the Red Cross and have him returned.	[]
Kyle	13	0	Ah, I told you we shouldn't have brought him to school dude.	[]
Principal Victoria	23	0	Okay, thank you very much. Yes, you can pick him up tonight. Bye now.  Now boys, I hope you've learned your lesson.	[]
Stan	1	0	No.	[]
Principal Victoria	7	0	You can't care for this child!	[]
Kyle	10	0	But I thought we were supposed to care on Thanksgiving.	[]
Principal Victoria	44	0	Yes, but you don't actually get involved with the child's life. You're supposed to just send money, and once in a while they write you a letter. You see, Marvin didn't grow up in a normal place like South Park.	[]
Stan	8	0	So why can't he live here now?	[]
Principal Victoria	4	0	Because he can't!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Because why?	[]
Principal Victoria	8	0	Because eight-year olds can't be parents!	[]
Kyle	6	0	Then you take care of him.	[]
Principal Victoria	17	0	I can't, I, umm...I'm very busy.  I send my five dollars a month, see?	[]
Stan	7	0	This sucks, Starvin' Marvin is our friend.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Oh well, back to the poor country with you.	[]
Kyle	15	0	You better watch what you say Cartman! You might be poor and hungry some day.	[]
Cartman	5	0	B-huh, huh. Yeah, right.	[]
Mephesto	14	0	I knew that you were the only person who would listen to me Chef.	[]
Chef	14	1	Yeah, well, let's get it over with. This place gives me the booboojeebees.	['booboojeebees']
Mephesto	10	0	Look here in my microscope; tell me what you see.	[]
Chef	13	0	Uhh, I seee...an extreme close up of ...Vanessa Redgrave's private parts.	[]
Mephesto	8	0	Oh, whoops.  Now tell me what you see.	[]
Chef	14	0	Well, I'm no biologist, but I'd say it looks like turkey DNA.	[]
Mephesto	8	0	Precisely, but look how rapidly it's dividing.	[]
Chef	4	0	What does it mean?	[]
Mephesto	25	0	Means the turkeys are growing at an exponential rate. If we don't destroy them all, they'll take over the town. Maybe the world.	[]
Chef	11	0	Oh, fudge!  Uhh, let me see that Vanessa Redgrave thing again.	[]
Mephesto	1	0	Sure.	[]
Agent 1	23	0	Hello there little boy, we're looking for a starving African child who was accidentally sent here instead of a Teiko sports watch.	[]
Cartman	24	1	Hey, hey, what's going on?!  Hey, let go of me! God-! Ey! I'll kick you in the nuts. D'you hear me?!	['nuts']
Agent 1	11	0	Here's your sports watch son, sorry for the mix-up.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Hey! Hey seriously! Hey, you're pissing me off, Starvin' Marvin!	[]
Marvin	1	0	Sweet.	[]
The Mayor	6	0	So how does this thing work?	[]
Aide	36	0	Well mayor, it's based on the cash grab, but instead of money, the cans of food are blown around inside the capsule. The POV inside catches as many as he can to feed his family.	[]
The Mayor	1	0	POVVVV?	[]
Aide	3	0	Poverty stricken citizen.	[]
The Mayor	8	1	Ohhoho, brilliant.  Daah!! What the hell is this!!	['hell']
Aide	15	0	I don't know mayor, I don't think it's listed on the program.	[]
Mephesto	15	0	They're increasing in number mayor. These are the vicious turkeys I warned you about.	[]
Chef	25	1	It's a, Ih-ihit's true mayor! Those turkeys just ripped apart my cafeteria!  Whooa! You won't get away with this, you bastards!	['bastards']
Kyle	7	0	Wow! Those are some pissed off turkeys!	[]
The Mayor	10	0	OKAY PEOPLE, DON'T PANIC! BRING OUT THE DEFENSE SQUAD!	[]
Mephesto	13	0	We need more than that! They'll only come back in increased numbers!	[]
Terrance	7	0	Hey Phillip, could you pass the beans?	[]
Phillip	14	0	Beans? Uh oh, looks like we'll be at war with these Indians soon.	[]
Terrance	17	1	Huh, eh,  wait wait wait.  Eh, eh.  Here it comes, ehhhh.  Daaaah, I crapped in my pants!	['crapped']
Phillip	11	0	Aaaah.  I think you got some spatter on Chief Running Wolf.	[]
Terrance	4	0	I spattered his face!	[]
Phillip	6	0	Now he's a smelly Indian.	[]
TV Announcer	17	0	We'll be back to part 14 of the Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special, right after this.	[]
Sally Struthers	15	0	Hunger is an enemy that we all must fight. These children desperately need your support.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Hey, somebody get me out of here! This sucks!	[]
Sally Struthers	8	0	So please, call and adopt a child today.	[]
Cartman	8	0	I'm seriously getting pissed off over here!!	[]
Liane	7	0	You want some more Cheesy Poofs hon?	[]
Marvin	6	0	Yeah, I want da Cheesy Poof.	[]
Liane	1	0	Okay.	[]
Marvin	1	0	Sweet.	[]
Cartman	50	2	Eh, This is serious bullshit! There has to be a Happy Burger around here somewhere.  Excuse me, I am a lost little boy, could you help me?  Well, screw you too!  What the?! Who the hell let all these flies in here?! Hasn't anybody ever heard of insect repellent?!	['bullshit', 'hell']
The Mayor	15	0	All right everyone, it's time to give out canned food to the poor, haa.	[]
Stan	4	0	Hey, where's Cartman?	[]
Kyle	11	0	I don't know. Do you know where he is, Marvin?	[]
The Mayor	27	0	Looks like we have the turkey problem under control. It's time to embrace the spirit of giving with the canned food grab.  Come on, hurry up.	[]
Mrs. McCormick	4	0	Grab a lot son.	[]
The Mayor	14	0	Have a happy Thanksgiving! Let 'er rip!  Cuhome on, grab those cans little boy!	[]

Stuart	3	0	Come on, son!	[]
The Mayor	29	0	Now, let's see all the goodies you're going to take home to your family.  It...looks like he got a... a-a can of- string beans. Hehe.	[]
Chef	2	0	What the-?!	[]

Chef	22	1	Gather around everybody, and listen good. Go to your homes and arm your...  What the hell are you supposed to be anyway?	['hell']
Mephesto	6	0	That's not important right now.	[]
Chef	17	1	No! What the hell is this little thing supposed to be? It doesn't look like anything.	['hell']
The Mayor	3	0	Chef, the turkeys!	[]
Chef	44	0	Oh, All right. Listen up everybody, and listen good. Go to your homes and arm yourselves with whatever you can. We'll meet back here in fifteen minutes. Hurry!  We are not going to let our Thanksgiving be ruined by a bunch of turkeys.	[]
Cartman	28	1	Damn, you guys, seriously, I'm hungry. I have to eat.  Ah, sweet! The Red Cross!  I'll have fried chicken and a side of mashed potatoes please.	['damn']
Red Cross Dude	13	0	Sorry kid, but we're out of food. We ran out of funding.	[]

Red Cross Dude	18	0	We just couldn't get enough sponsors back home, so now we've got to pack it up.	[]
Cartman	14	0	But I'm not a starving Etheropian! I have to get back home too!	[]
Red Cross Dude	15	0	Sorry dude, we just don't have any funds. Here, have a Teiko sports watch.	[]
Cartman	1	0	WEEEEEEAK!!!	[]
The Mayor	12	0	People, we all have to do our part against the evil turkeys.	[]
Townsperson 1	6	0	There's too many of them.	[]
The Mayor	7	0	Come on! Where is that Thanksgiving spirit?!	[]
Townsperson 2	5	0	We can't stop them.	[]
Chef	44	0	Today, you fight for your city! You fight for your honor! These turkeys will continue to push until they have taken everything from us! These fudged up turkeys from the the crustaceous era can take our lives, but they can never take...our FREEDOM!!!	[]

The Mayor	5	0	Does my hair look okay?	[]
Cartman	50	0	Can't go on... need... appetizer... eh...  I'm sorry, God, I'm sorry I mocked poor people. I'm sorry I wasn't more sensitive. Please, Please God, uhh.  Heh, my god has forsaken me. Eh, err.  Huh, I wonder what's in here?  SNACKY CAKES!! MMMM!  Sally Struthers?!	[]

Chef	8	0	Every turkey dies, not every turkey truly lives.	[]
Mephesto	26	0	As horrible as they were theh- they felt like a part of me. Perhaps I shouldn't be toying with God's creations, perhaps I should-	[]
Chef	3	0	Yeah, yeah, yeah.	[]
Agent 2	25	0	Excuse me sir, we're looking for a little starving Ethiopian boy who was accidentally delivered to South Park instead of a Teiko sports watch.	[]
Agent 1	7	0	Have you seen anyone fitting this description.	[]

Agent 1	10	0	There you are. Are you ready to go home now?	[]
Stan	7	0	Wow, it sucks he has to leave.	[]
Kyle	9	0	Yeah, I like him a lot more than Cartman.	[]
Stan	48	0	You know, I think I've learned something today. It's really easy not to think of images on TV as real people.  But they are. That's why it's easy to ignore those commercials, but, people on TV are just as real as you or I.	[]
Kyle	11	0	Yeah.  And that means that McGyver is a real person too.	[]
Red Cross Chick	17	0	We're terribly sorry about the mix-up little boy. We'll get you back home immediately.	[]
