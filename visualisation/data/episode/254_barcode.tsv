Dr. Carroll	37	0	No, you actually got stabbed by a hooker. We've called your parents and they're on their way. Your dad wanted me to let you know that you're grounded more than you can possibly imagine.	[]

Butters	2	0	Nuh uh!	[]
Cartman	50	0	Yeahuh huh. I told you never to take the headset off outside the access point, didn't I?! We're actually both in my house right now. You're wearing the headset and I'm talking to you as a computer program. That's why I can... manipulate reality._	[]
Butters	2	0	WHAT??_	[]
Cartman	12	0	You see, in this world, things aren't... what they seam._	[]
Butters	4	0	Aghah. Okay, stop! Stooop!	[]
Cartman	37	0	Listen to me carefully, Butters. The Oculus Compromise has been streamlined. You can't trust anyone in this reality. Say nothing to no one about the Oculus Rift. If you think they know, they will kill you.	[]
Butters	6	0	Ah how do you know that?!	[]
Cartman	15	0	How would I know that the nurse is about to walk through that door?_	[]

Cartman	17	0	I'm happy that I totally got away with it.__What's a 911 area code?_Hello?	[]
Steve	35	0	Hello, Eric. My name is Steve from Oculus Customer Service. There seems to be an error with our virtual headsets, and on behalf of the company, I would like to apologize and try to help.	[]
Cartman	2	0	With what?	[]
Steve	47	0	This is going to be very jarring for you, but, there has been a malfunction with the headset you ordered from us. Right now, you're actually in your room at your computer wearing an Oculus headset, but, you're in a coma-like trance, my friend.	[]
Cartman	2	1	Fuck you!	['fuck']
Steve	20	0	I understand your shock, my friend, but you have simply been in the virtual world so long you have forgotten.	[]
Kyle	7	0	You should probably listen to him, dude.	[]
Cartman	20	0	Uh huh. 'Cause I thought I was messing with Butters, but I'm actually the one trapped in virtual reality.	[]
Steve	12	0	The people you are talking to are just computer programs, my friend.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Guys, tell him you're not computer programs.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Maybe we are.	[]
Cartman	9	1	Kyle, just- don't be a dick right now.	['dick']
Steve	17	0	I know this is very hard for you, but we don't have a lot of time.	[]
Cartman	30	1	Do you really think I'm that stupid?! That I believe all of this all along has been me living out some kind of virtual reality fantasy? Fuck you!_	['fuck']
Liane	56	0	Eric? Poopsiekins?__Eric?__Honey, maybe that's enough computer time. It's been about nineteen hours now.__I know you said not to disturb you with your new toy, but Mommy thought maybe you needed to eat?__All right, I'll just leave it here, hon.__I'm turning in for the night. Mommy loves you.	[]
Stephen	39	1	What kind of person did we raise you to be?! You think this world is just there for your amusement?! You are not to leave this room, and you are not allowed to use the phone or the computer!	['amusement']
Butters	15	0	Please! You can't do that! I have to find a way out of this!	[]
Stephen	7	0	Oh no, mister! You are GROUNDED!_	[]
Cartman	5	1	Are you fucking with me?!	['fucking']
Butters	5	0	...What? What do you mean?	[]
Cartman	9	1	Butters, I'm seriously! Are you fucking with me?!	['fucking']
Butters	7	0	I don't know what you mean.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Because if you are, it's not cool!	[]
Butters	14	0	Eric, you said you were going to get me out of this virtual world!	[]
Cartman	27	0	Butters, I talked to Oculus Customer Service, and they said I'm the one who's wearing a headset and has forgotten he's in virtual reality!	[]
Butters	7	0	Oh really? Oh, that's a relief.	[]
Cartman	28	0	Oh it's a relief, huh?! Well guess what, Butters! If I'm the one trapped in virtual reality, that means you're nothing but a computer program!	[]
Butters	2	0	Oh gosh!	[]
Cartman	3	0	That's right!	[]
Butters	2	0	OH GOSH!	[]
Cartman	36	0	THAT'S RIGHT! And you'd better stop messin' around, Butters, so I can help you out of this! Because you know how I said if you die in virtual reality you die in real life?	[]
Butters	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Cartman	18	0	Well if you get grounded in virtual reality you get grounded in real life too! For EVER!_	[]
Kyle	1	0	Hello?	[]
Butters	8	0	Kyle, it's Butters. I've been grounded!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Again?	[]
Butters	22	0	No no, you don't understand. This time I've been grounded for no good reason! I didn't do anything, Kyle!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Uh huh.	[]
Butters	34	0	I think there's somethin' supernatural goin' on. I asked my dad why I was being grounded, and he said that for asking him, that I was more grounded! It doesn't make sense!	[]
Kyle	12	0	Butters, Butters, I'm, I'm kind of super busy right now.	[]
Butters	15	0	PLEASE! Just go to Cartman's house. I think the answer might be within the-	[]
Stephen	4	0	Butters?! Who is that?!	[]
Butters	4	0	Ahhh! Wuhhhh! Ahhh-_	[]
Kenny	11	1	(You guys! You guys, oh shit, come check this out!)_	['shit']
Kenny	16	0	(You see? Look at all these piles of food. He must have been here for days!)	[]
Kyle	15	0	You found Cartman like this and you think he's somehow trapped in virtual reality?	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Yeah!)	[]
Kyle	2	1	Fuck you!	['fuck']
Kenny	1	0	(What??)	[]
Kyle	3	0	Get up, Cartman!	[]
Kenny	6	0	(This isn't a prank, Kyle!)	[]
Kyle	19	1	Okay, then let's take him to the hospital. You hear that, fatso!__You're goin' to the hospital!	['fatso']
Stan	6	0	Kyle, maybe this is for real.	[]
Kyle	8	1	Fuck you if you're in on this.	['fuck']
Stan	6	0	In on what?__Ohh,__Fuck you!	[]
Steve	56	0	Yes, no, sorry, but because you bought two business-class tickets I can NOT refund the fares.__That's right, there is nothing we can do. All right. Have I answered all your customer concerns in a timely, polite manner? Thank you for calling Korean Airlines Customer Service.__El Pollo Loco Customer Service, this is Steve.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Oh. Ah, we're trying to reach Oculus Customer Service.	[]
Steve	12	0	Oh, yes, ah, yes my friend.__Oculus Customer Service, this is Steve.	[]
Kyle	26	0	Yeah, our friend has been missing for a few days, so we went and checked on him, and he's in a coma wearing your headset.	[]
Steve	8	0	Ohh yehhs, yes. What is your name please?	[]
Kyle	1	0	Kyle.	[]
Steve	26	0	Kyle. I need to advise you that this call may be recorded to help with better customer service in the future. Is that agreeable to you?	[]
Kyle	4	0	I don't care!	[]
Steve	24	0	He doesn't care! I can continue! All right, listen very carefully my friend. The headsets we sold you are having some minor problems.	[]
Kyle	9	0	You mean he's actually stuck in virtual reality?!	[]
Steve	25	0	Yes. And that is why we are trying to locate all the headsets and do a recall. Do you understand? It is a Total Recall.	[]
Kyle	2	1	Fuck you!	['fuck']
Stan	3	1	Fuck you what?	['fuck']
Kyle	8	0	He said they're doing a Total Recall.	[]
Stan	3	1	Oh fuck you!	['fuck']
Steve	18	0	All right, did I take care of all your customer needs in a timely and satisfactory fashion today?	[]
Kyle	6	0	You haven't done anything yet!	[]
Steve	17	0	But the customer service - was that reliable? And did I accurately and politely respond to your concerns?	[]
Kyle	9	0	We need help! Our friend is in a coma!	[]
Steve	44	0	Uhhh let's see, ah, it looks like... one of you is going to have to put on the Oculus headset and go into the virtual world and convince your friend to get to an access point. Could you try that, my friend?_	[]
Cartman	30	0	It's okay. Everything is cool. Don't let anyone mess with your head, and it's all going to be fine. You're cool, Eric. You're cool._	[]
Kyle	8	0	Hey Cartman, I need to talk to you.	[]
Cartman	9	0	I know. Let's go to the backyard._	[]
Kyle	20	0	Cartman, I'm going to tell you something, and I need you to believe me, even if it seems impossible.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Okay Kyle.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Alright, here it goes. Cartman, you aren't really here.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Mmm. And why do you know that, Kyle?	[]
Kyle	39	0	Because I saw you. Okay? In your room, passed out, with a VR headset on. Customer Service said that one of us needed to put on the headset and come get you, and that's why I'm here.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Mmmhmm.	[]
Kyle	13	0	I know it's hard to believe, but you have to trust me.	[]
Cartman	8	0	And why did the guys send you, Kyle?	[]
Kyle	5	0	Www-what do you mean?	[]
Cartman	32	0	Kyle, I want you to brace yourself. This is going to be extremely hard to believe, but you are the one that has been in a coma with a VR headset on.	[]
Kyle	2	1	Fuck you!	['fuck']
Cartman	38	0	I know it's hard to grasp, Kyle, but I was the one sent by customer service to try and convince you that none of what you've seen is real. You bought the Oculus Rift headset, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Don't... do that!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Calm down.	[]
Kyle	10	0	NO! I put your headset on, and came here to-	[]
Cartman	6	0	In virtual reality, yes you did.	[]
Kyle	8	0	No. Then I came into this virtual space.	[]
Cartman	29	0	You've been in a virtual space all along, Kyle! Think about it: we're arch-rivals! Why would the guys send you in to convince me of anything?!	[]
Kyle	9	1	Fuck you! Why would they send_you_in to convince_me_of anything?!	['fuck']
Cartman	1	1	Fuck!	['fuck']
Best Buy Rep	11	0	Thanks for callin' Best Buy. How can I direct your call?	[]

Linda	13	0	Oh. I don't know, Stephen, I let you handle all the groundings.	[]

Stan	11	0	No, listen, I called Customer Service because I need help!_	[]
Kyle	14	0	Wait. Stan?__Hold on, is this my virtual reality, or Cartman's virtual reality?	[]
Stan	21	0	It's neither. I know this might be hard for you to grasp right now, but this is all actually real.	[]
Kyle	12	0	Nono, after we found Cartman, I put the headset on and then-	[]
Stan	11	0	No dude, dude. We've all been here the entire time.	[]
Kyle	22	1	Holy shit. Then this is all real. We've all been here from the beginning. Taking turns on the Oculus Rift headset.	['shit']
Cartman	7	0	No, you guys. This is virtual reality.	[]

Cartman	6	0	Because... I'm a computer program.	[]
Kyle	4	1	God damn it Cartman!	['damn']
Cartman	21	0	I'm telling you guys, I swear, you have to believe me, I am a computer program. I'm not real.	[]
Kyle	3	0	He's lying.	[]
Cartman	10	0	I'm not lying. Go ahead and ask Customer Service.	[]
Stan	14	0	What was the name of the first person who called you for customer service?	[]
Steve	11	0	Ohhh yes yes yes! That I_can_answer! His name was... But-ters!	[]
Stan	5	0	Butters called Customer Service first?	[]

Stan	9	0	Come on, we're going to Butters' house!_	[]
Steve	27	0	Hello? My friend? My friend, I believe we are having some technical issues with our phone line. Please hang on, I'm going to call Customer Service.	[]
Steve	6	0	Hello, Customer Service, this is Steve.	[]
Steve	7	0	Hello, this is Steve with Customer Service.	[]
Steve	10	0	Uhhh, nononono my friend. I am Steve with Customer Service.	[]
Steve	21	0	Listen, my friend. This is gong to be very hard to comprehend, but none of what you are seeing is real.	[]
Steve	3	0	...Ohhh, nohhh, nonononononono.	[]
Steve	33	0	My friend, my friend, a customer who is in virtual reality called Customer Service, and it has created a customer feedback loop. Okay? Here in India we call it a customer feedback vindaloop.	[]
Steve	3	1	Ohhh, fuck you!	['fuck']
Steve	31	2	Nononononono, do not fuck me, because I am you and then we will just be fucking ourselves. Now, have I provided answers to your questions in a courteous and prompt fashion?	['fuck', 'fucking']
Steve	19	0	What do you mean have you answered all my questions?! NO! You have not answered ANY questions at ALL!	[]
Steve	18	0	Nonononono no, listen, listen: if I didn't answer your questions, then we have given bad customer service!	[]
Steve	9	0	But you didn't answer any of my questions!	[]
Steve	13	0	Well what is more important, my friend? The result, or good customer service?	[]
Butters	19	0	I'm troubled, I'm troubled in mind. If Jesus don't help me I surely will die._	[]
Stan	1	0	Butters.	[]
Butters	8	0	Huh. But...__you guys can't be here.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Why not?	[]
Butters	8	0	Because I'm grounded. That means no visitors.	[]
Kyle	9	0	Butters! When did you call Oculus Rift Customer Service?!	[]
Butters	52	1	When we were playing with the Oculus headset. Wuh don't you guys remember?__We were all messin' around with it. I played with it first, and, and went a little nuts. Uh I forgot I was in virtual reality and I got grounded, and now I'm grounded in real life.	['nuts']

Butters	1	0	YES.	[]

Stephen	6	0	What are your friends doing here?!	[]
Butters	5	0	Huh I'm sorry Dad!	[]
Steve	8	0	Hello, hello my friend, are you still there?	[]
Stan	4	0	Yes, we're here.	[]
Steve	43	0	Listen carefully, my friend. You are stuck in a paradox. It turns out there are three things you cannot do in virtual reality. You cannot die, you cannot get grounded, and you cannot call Customer Service. This is why you are having problems.	[]
Stephen	13	0	You just don't get it, do you?! What is wrong with you?!	[]
Stan	12	0	Well then how much of what just happened was in virtual reality?	[]
Steve	11	0	That does not matter! There is only one thing that matters!	[]
Stan	2	0	What?!_	[]
Steve	11	0	Have I answered your questions satisfactorily and offered GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE?!	[]
Stan	6	0	That doesn't make sense!_	[]
Steve	32	0	That's the paradox! Please my friend, please! I am not real! You are not real! Have I answered your questions and provided good customer service?! This call may be recorded!_	[]
Stephen	6	0	Well you're getting it now!	[]
Stan	25	0	Yes! Yes, you have answered all my questions and I am pleased with the customer service I have been provided!!__You guys? Are you there?	[]
Kyle	9	0	We're right here dude. Do you remember now?	[]
Stan	12	0	Yeah I remember. I'm heading back to the access point._	[]
