Stan	12	0	Oh yeah, dude, it's summer. That means we gotta buy fireworks.	[]
Kyle	10	0	I saved up enough to buy M-80s this year.	[]

Ned	5	0	Mmmm-where are we going?	[]
Jimbo	3	0	Mexico, my amigo.	[]
Ned	7	0	Mmmm-why are we going to Mexico?	[]
Jimbo	24	0	To buy fireworks. Just 'cause some kid blew off his hands doesn't mean the rest of us have to suffer, now, does it?	[]
Ned	5	0	Are fireworks legal in Mexico?	[]
Jimbo	11	1	Hell, everything's legal in Mexico. It's the American way.	['hell']
Charlie	18	0	At the Dyno Might Firework Company, we have a commitment to excellence.  Our focus is on safety while--	[]
Mayor	11	0	Just cut to the chase and tell us about the snake!	[]
Charlie	23	0	Oh, o-kay.  Let's see...  Now, the disk that we are making is approximately 5,000 times bigger than the average snake.	[]
Mayor	1	0	Ooooh!	[]
Charlie	20	0	We'll have to fly it in with three Comanche helicopters and lower it onto the ground at the lake.	[]
Mayor	2	0	Comanche helicopters...	[]
Charlie	25	0	Then we'll need 57 flamethrowers, all set up around the perimeter of the disk, that are all triggered to fire at the same time.	[]
Mayor	6	0	...flamethrowers, triggered at the same time...	[]
Charlie	14	0	Once lit, the snake will grow.  And good times will be had by all.	[]
Aide 1	1	0	Wonderful.	[]
Aide 2	1	0	Spectacular.	[]
Mayor	33	0	Well, you see? Fireworks at the lake will not only go on, but perhaps be the best ever. Wait a minute! We're gonna need an orchestra to play The Stars and Stripes!	[]

Mayor	18	0	Yes! Get the school principal on the phone! And we need somebody to dress up like Uncle Remus!	[]

Mr. Garrison	7	0	Hello, children. How is your summer going?	[]
Stan	5	1	Summer sucks ass, Mr. Garrison.	['ass']
Kyle	7	0	Hey, have you found Mr. Hat yet?	[]
Mr. Garrison	17	0	Oh, that old thing? Why, I almost forgot he was gone. I don't need Mr. Hat.	[]
Stan	3	0	That's good.	[]
Mr. Garrison	6	0	Mr. Hat is just a puppet.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Yup.	[]
Mr. Garrison	5	0	Mr. Hat isn't real.	[]
Stan	1	0	Right.	[]
Cartman	18	0	Hey, you guys, my mom signed me up for swimming lessons at the community pool. You wanna come?	[]

Conductor	38	0	Oh, dear. How are we supposed to sound good without our French horn section? Oh, let's try some scales first. C scale first. And...  Okay, that was pretty good. Let's play Mozart's Symphony No. 5.	[]
Mayor	31	1	Oh, we're doomed. Our Fourth of July celebration is going to have no fireworks and a bunch of tone-deaf little shits playing.  Wait a minute... It's the snake!	['shits']
Barbrady	19	0	Let's move along, people. If you've seen one giant snake-thingy firework, you've seen them all.	[]

Anchor	38	0	Fourth of July is finally here, and with the state-wide ban on fireworks, people from all over Colorado are flocking to South Park. Here with a special report is a normal-looking guy with a funny name.	[]
Creamy Goodness	119	0	Thanks, Tom. It looks like the firework ban won't be putting a damper on one town's festivities tonight. I'm here at Stark's Pond in South Park, where the crowd of residents and scores of tourists anxiously await the lighting of the largest snake in human history.  Now, as most of you will probably remember, snakes are these little round disks that you light, and they spew out a little snake of black ash. Well, the South Park snake is over half a mile in diameter, and twenty stories high. I'm told that this event won't begin until the sun goes down and night is upon us.  Alrighty then, looks like we're ready.	[]
Stan	7	0	How are your swimming lessons going, Cartman?	[]
Cartman	1	0	Fine.	[]
Kyle	11	0	I heard you won't even get in the deep end.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Well, you heard wrong, hippie!	[]

Mayor	5	1	Oh, hell. Light the snake!	['hell']
Audience	2	0	Ooooooh!  Ahhhhh!	[]
Jimbo	37	0	Alright, Ned. Now we're coming up to the American border. They can't know that we have fireworks in the trunk. Just let me do the talking.  I guess that goes without saying, doesn't it?	[]
Guard	3	0	Good evening, gentlemen.	[]
Jimbo	14	0	Hello there, fellow American. We're just anxious to get back to our homeland.	[]
Guard	10	0	Alright, I just need to ask you a few questions.	[]

Guard	10	0	Do you have any firearms or explosives in the car?	[]
Jimbo	5	0	Yes.  I mean, no! No!	[]
Guard	5	0	Open your trunk, please, sir.	[]
Jimbo	8	2	Damn! Damn! I always get that question wrong!	['damn', 'damn']
Mayor	26	0	My God, it's beautiful. It never fails to amaze me how I manage to overcome adversity.  Say uh, Charlie, when does that thing die out?	[]

Mayor	13	0	Yes, you know, expire, end.  Hello? I'm asking you when it stops?	[]
Charlie	22	0	Uhhh, I'm not sure; I never made one this big.  I guess we didn't quite think this through, did we?	[]
Mayor	1	0	What?!	[]
Kyle	5	0	Dude! That thing is huge!	[]
Stan	7	0	Yeah, they need to shut it off.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Hey! You guys are screwin' up the song!	[]

Stan	6	0	Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!	[]
Kyle	2	1	You bastard!	['bastard']
Mayor	14	0	Oh my God!  You tell me, how much longer this thing is gonna last?!	[]
Charlie	10	0	Let's see. A normal-size snake lasts three minutes...	[]
Mayor	6	0	So when does it run out?!	[]
Charlie	4	0	November. Of next year.	[]
Mayor	2	1	Oh, hell..!	['hell']
Creamy Goodness	40	0	Well, we're coming up on nine hours, and the giant snake of South Park shows no signs of stopping. Residents have tried everything from firehoses to yelling at it to make the snake stop, but nothing seems to work.	[]
Tom	26	0	Thanks, Creamy. Police are advising all citizens to stay indoors, not breathe the ashen air, and not ever light any giant snakes in the near future.	[]
Stan	3	0	Man, this sucks.	[]
Kyle	18	0	What should we do, dude? That big snake keeps growing; it's gonna demolish the whole state soon!	[]

Cartman	1	0	Wow.	[]
Kyle	5	0	How is that gonna help?	[]
Anchor	16	0	All over America, the effects of the giant ash snake of South Park can be seen.	[]
Preacher	11	0	Yea, let the spirit of Heavenly Father be blessed upon you.	[]
Assistant	8	0	From this day on, all will be well.	[]
New Mormon	8	0	I already feel like things are getting better.	[]
Mr. Garrison	16	0	And I can't sleep or think...  Where would he have gone? Why would he leave?	[]
Dr. Katz	16	0	Well um, let me ask you this. Why? Wher-where do you think... Mr. Hat... went?	[]
Mr. Garrison	20	2	How the fuck should I know? If I knew that, I wouldn't be seein' a fuckin' psychiatrist, would I?	['fuck', 'fuckin']
Dr. Katz	11	0	Well... I guess, I-I see what you're saying. Yeah.	[]
Mr. Garrison	26	0	At first I was sure one of the children took him, but then I remembered that Mr. Hat and I actually had a fight that morning.	[]
Dr. Katz	5	1	Um... Ahem...  Are you gay?	['gay']
Mr. Garrison	1	0	What?!	[]
Dr. Katz	10	0	It-it's j-just-- It's just a question.	[]
Mr. Garrison	4	0	Are you propositioning me?	[]
Dr. Katz	1	0	No.	[]
Mr. Garrison	11	1	Well, I can tell that that I am 100% not gay!	['gay']
Dr. Katz	8	0	Well, I believe you, I... absolutely believe you.	[]
Mr. Garrison	6	0	Mr. Hat, on the other hand...	[]
Dr. Katz	4	1	Mr. Hat was gay?	['gay']
Mr. Garrison	7	1	Sometimes he fantasizes about same-sex relations.	['sex']
Dr. Katz	2	0	I see.	[]
Mr. Garrison	21	0	Sometimes Mr. Hat liked to pretend he was in a sauna with Brett Favre, and a bottle of Thousand Island dressing.	[]
Dr. Katz	7	0	That I did not need to know.	[]
Mr. Garrison	5	0	Well, I'm just sayin'.	[]
Dr. Katz	49	4	Mr. Garrison, I think that Mr. Hat was actually your gay side trying to come out. You see, it's-it's you that's gay, but, but you're in denial, so...you act out your gay persona with a homosexual puppet.  What do you think about that?	['gay', 'gay', 'gay', 'homosexual']
Mr. Garrison	17	2	I think you're the loony one in this room.  Serves you right, you gay-bashing homo.	['gay', 'homo']

Reporter	48	0	As more and more cities are affected by the growing ash and the death toll rises to 3,000,  people from all over the country are looking to the Mayor of South Park for answers.  And it appears as if the Mayor is going to explain matters now.	[]
Aide 1	20	0	Uh, ladies and gentlemen, the Mayor of South Park regrets that she cannot be here herself, but she is... sick.	[]
Reporter 2	8	0	Sick?! What kind of lame excuse is that?	[]
Print Reporter	5	0	You gotta be kidding me!	[]

Jimbo	6	0	Oh, now, why the long faces?	[]
Kyle	3	0	We're bored.	[]

Jimbo	16	0	Well, I don't think those are problems  that some Tijuana bottle rockets can't solve!	[]
Stan/Kyle	1	0	Hooray!	[]
Jimbo	14	0	Careful with those, now, those are dangerous.  Point 'em away from your eyes, now.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Wow! These are huge!	[]
