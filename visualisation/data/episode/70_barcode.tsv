Stan	11	1	I don't think we're female groupies or random sluts.	['sluts']

Obese woman	3	1	What the hell?	['hell']
Terrance	5	0	Oh wow! We had quadruplets!	[]
Stan	16	0	We're not quadruplets, Terrance. We snuck in that woman's spandex to get in here.	[]
Terrance	19	0	Oh! Thank God. The last thing I need is more kids.  What do you want, an autograph or something?	[]
Kyle	28	0	Nuh, it's more important than that. Our school is putting on a big show for Earth Day, and we promised people we could get you to perform.	[]
Terrance	15	0	Earth Day, huh? That sounds like a very noble cause. How much does it pay?	[]
Stan	4	0	But where's Phillip?	[]
Terrance	1	0	Who?	[]
Kyle	3	0	Phillip, your partner.	[]
Terrance	60	0	Why is it that every time somebody sees me they have to say, Hey, where's Phillip? Like we're freaking married or something! You know, I'll let you tater-tots in on a little secret: Phillip is a HACK!  You know who wrote all the Terrance and Phillip stuff? ME! Phillip never did anything but read his lines!	[]
Kyle	7	0	But the guy who replaced him sucks!	[]
Terrance	37	1	Ah, I know.  I know he sucks  To be honest, things haven't been going so well lately. I'm not making any money because everyone wants to see Phillip. Why? What the hell does Phillip do?	['hell']
Stan	7	0	Because, dude, it's Terrance and Phillip.	[]
Terrance	21	0	Ogh, whatever.  The point is, Phillip and I are through.  And apparently, so is the act. And so is the money.	[]
Stan	21	0	What if we can get Phillip to agree to get back together. Will you do the Earth Day show for us?	[]
Terrance	25	0	HA! Goood luck getting Phillip! He left because he wanted to do  more serious stuff. Last I heard, he was doing Canadian Shakespeare in Toronto.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Toronto?)	[]
Kyle	10	0	But we promised the Earth Day people you'd perform.	[]
Terrance	17	1	Well, in that case, I'd say you four boys are up Fart Creek without a paddle.	['fart']
Older man	13	0	Work! Work, children! We only have two more days until Earth Day! Work!	[]
Clyde	21	0	Ah, excuse me? My daddy is a geologist and he says there actually isn't any concrete evidence of global warming.	[]
Older man	16	0	That's not true.  Global warming is going to kill us all.  The Republicans are responsible.	[]
Clyde	2	0	Thank you.	[]
Stan	3	0	Oh no, dude.	[]
Older man	19	0	Oh, there you are, boys. I need Terrance and Phillip's information so I can tell them their schedule.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Uuuh, we didn't get them.	[]
Older man	2	0	You what?	[]
Stan	6	0	They're not together anymore, dude.	[]
Younger man	11	0	You'd better be joking. We've already announced their participation.	[]
Kyle	17	0	Look, we could we could probably get Terrance, but he'll be performing with this other guy.	[]
Older man	23	0	You promised us Terrance and Phillip! We therefore promised the WORLD Terrance and Phillip! You WILL get us Terrance and Phillip, or else!	[]
Stan	14	0	But there's nothing we can do. Phillip is doing Shakespeare in Canada now.	[]
Older man	29	1	Then you'd better get your asses to Canada and GET him. We'll make travel arrangements.  Nothing is more important than the environment, boys. Not even your lives.	['asses']
Kyle	9	0	Well, guys, I guess we're going to Canada.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Weak.	[]
Phillip	1	0	Ahhh	[]

Laertes	71	0	It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain; No medicine in the world can do thee good; In thee there is not half an hour of life; The treacherous instrument is in thy hand, unbated and envenom'd: the foul practice hath turn'd itself on me lo, here I lie,Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd: I can no more: the king, the king's to blame.	[]
Hamlet	11	0	The point!--envenom'd too! Then, venom, to thy work, buddih!	[]

Laertes	32	0	He is served;It is a poison temper'd by himself.Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:Mine and my father's death come not upon thee, Nor thine on me. Blagh!	[]
Hamlet	76	0	Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee, guy. I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu! You that look pale and tremble at this chance, buddih, That are but mutes or audience to this act,  Had I but time--as this fell sergeant, death, Is strict in his arrest--O, I could tell you, buddih--But let it be. Horatio, I am dead; Thou livest, guy; report me and my cause aright, to the unsatisfied.	[]
Horatio	19	0	Never believe it: I am more an antique Roman than a Dane: Here's yet some liquor left, buddih.	[]
Stan	9	0	Jesus Tapdancing Christ, is this thing ever gonna end?	[]
Hamlet	22	0	...he has my dying voice;So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,Which have solicited. The rest is silence. Blagh.	[]
Horatio	19	0	Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince:And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest, buddih!...	[]
Stan	2	0	Phillip! Phillip!	[]
Phillip	1	0	Yes?	[]
Stan	18	0	Our town in Colorado was chosen to host Earth Day this year and... we need a big act.	[]
Phillip	17	0	Oh, really? This run of Hamlet is closing down, I'm afraid. We could take it there.	[]
Stan	21	0	Ah, well, we were thinking how cool it would be if you and Terrance got back together for a reunion and-	[]
Phillip	13	0	AH! Stop right there! I'm not doin' nothin' with that fatass egomaniac!	[]
Stan	4	0	But we need you!	[]

Phillip	14	0	I'm in! Here, call me at this number with the details.  Gotta run!	[]
Stan	10	0	Dude, you didn't tell him Terrance would be there.	[]
Kyle	34	0	I didn't see he wouldn't be there, either. Look, all we have to do is get them there, right? Once Terrance and Phillip get together again, it'll be like old times.	[]
Cartman	14	0	Oh, Kyle, you just made a huge withdrawal at the First Bank of Lies.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Ih-it'll be okay.	[]

Reporter	60	0	Tom, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado, where Earth Day 2001 is in full force.  Environmental awareness games, booths, and of course,  the entertainment on stage, which is being broadcast live all over the country. This eco-happy crowd is thrilled and waiting in anticipation for the arrival of Terrance and Phillip, who are promised by these four boys.	[]
Jack	16	0	What a touching and true song. You know, it's true.  Republicans are ruining the earth.	[]

Kyle	19	0	Hooray for the earth! We must protect it.  And now, as promised, here are TERRANCE AND PHILLIP, on video!	[]
Carl	2	0	On video?	[]
Narrator	35	0	They were considered the best comedy act in all of Canada.  But a fast-paced rocket ride to success would bring them to the depths of despair.  This is Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow.	[]
Crowd	1	0	Wow!	[]
Carl	7	1	What the hell do you call this?!	['hell']
Kyle	14	0	Eh it's Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow. I taped it last month.	[]
Jack	20	0	We promised people Terrance and Phillip, not a video documentary! You've ruined the earth for the last time, boys!	[]
The Boys	1	0	Aaaahh!	[]
Narrator	97	0	Terrance was born Terrance Henry Stoot, in the small Canadian village of Toronto.  At a very early age his parents noticed an uncanny musical ability and decided to enroll him in the Canadian School for gifted babies.  It was here that he partnered up with Phillip Niles Argyle , a brash young baby from Montreal.  Together, they performed musical acts that stunned Canadians everywhere.  At the tender age of six, Terrance and Phillip were off to the United States to perform on the Ed Sullivan show . where American audiences would be exposed to Canadians for the first time.	[]
Ed Sullivan	26	0	And now, ladies and gentlemen, we have two adorable little boys from Canada. Please put your hands together for the music of young Terrance and Phillip.	[]
Terrance & Phillip	32	0	Beef and lamb, chicken and ham, Step to the left and clap your hands! Gosh we love our chicken and ham. Don't let it go to waste that chicken and ham!	[]
Woman	9	0	Oh my God, what's wrong with their heads?!	[]
Man	8	0	It's alright, darling, they're just Canadian.	[]
Woman	1	0	Oooh.	[]
Terrance & Phillip	32	0	Beef and lamb, chicken and ham, Step to the left and clap your hands! Gosh we love our chicken and ham. Don't let it go to waste that chicken and ham!	[]
Narrator	46	0	The Canadian act confused American audiences.  But then something happened that would change Terrance and Phillip's act forever.  It was the birth of Canadian comedy.  Terrance and Phillip spent the next several years perfecting their art, and meeting some of America's most influential people.	[]
Phillip	8	0	Excuse me, which way is the bus station?	[]
Mr. Garrison	8	0	Hey, you're the guy on the screen.	[]
Phillip	1	0	What?	[]
Narrator	25	0	But it was in 1974, on the Sonny & Cher Show, that Terrance and Phillip finally started to mix their Canadian humor with deep political insight.	[]
Sonny	15	0	You know, Cher, a lot of us real Americans don't know much about Canada.	[]
Cher	16	0	Well, a lot of us real Americans aren't as stupid and short as you, hm.	[]
Sonny	14	0	Please put your groovy hands together for the young and talented Terrance and Phillip!	[]
Phillip	19	0	Say, Terrance, I'm getting worried aboot all these Russians making missiles. Maybe we should stop this cold war.	[]
Terrance	6	0	Here's a missile for ya!	[]
Phillip	3	0	That's better.	[]
Narrator	32	0	With this bold mix of humor and political insight, the world couldn't get enough of Terrance and Phillip.  But their fame would come at a price, when Behind the Blow continues.	[]
Stan	7	0	Okay. Okay, I think we lost them.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Jesus, man, those Earth Day people don't screw around!	[]
Cartman	27	0	Kyle, none of this would be happening if you hadn't LIED in the first place! You lied, and then you lied to cover up your lie!	[]
Kyle	11	1	I didn't see you complaining at the time, fat boy!	['fat']
Stan	20	0	Guys, we have no choice. We're gonna have to move away. Environmental activists don't use logic or reason.	[]
Carl	3	0	There they are!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Haaah!	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Aahhh!)	[]
Stan	4	0	Go! Run run run!	[]
Narrator	92	0	As they entered their late teens, Terrance and Phillip were already starting to taste the sweet milk of success.  But the price of fame was looming, as Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow continues.  The '70s and '80s were a good time for young Terrance and Phillip.  Their act on the Donny and Marie Show earned them a Nobel Peace Prize. They were on the cover of every magazine.  And then in 1998, even a Saturday morning cartoon was made, based on Terrance and Phillip.  Terrance and Phillip themselves supplied the voices.	[]
Phillip	14	0	Say Terrance, what should we do aboot this strange planet we've crashed on?	[]

Narrator	184	1	The cartoon was such a huge success that it started to breed confusion over whether Terrance and Phillip were animated characters or real people. And so, in 1998,  the comedy team started work on what they thought would be their greatest achievement: A made-for-TV movie written by and starring Terrance and Phillip, called Not Without My Anus.  It was their biggest project to date. But it had the misfortune of being scheduled on a night when a different and more popular show, the John Schneider Variety Hour , was supposed to air. When fans tuned in to see John Schneider and instead were treated to the Canadian made-for-TV movie , they were enraged, bewildered, and scared.  The fans revolted and burned down the network, killing six television producers and wounding twelve others.  The hatred of Terrance and Phillip had begun. Terrance fell into a deep depression and started abusing wood polish.  Phillip beat up an angry six-year-old fan and was sued for six million dollars. It was the first time the duo tasted failure , and it nearly killed them both.	['anus']

Narrator	118	2	After years of depression and suicide attempts, Terrance and Phillip finally decided to get together  for one last film:  the 1999 hit, Asses of Fire. It was one of the highest-grossing films of the summer.  And though the film also started the Canadian-American War of 1999 , in which eight million people lost their lives, the film was considered a great success.  After almost being executed by the American government , Terrance and Phillip were eventually returned to Canada , where they were touted as heroes.  They have been to hell and back, through the very best and the very worst of times, together, but they had seen it through.  And so ends Terrance and Phillip, Behind the Blow.	['asses', 'hell']
