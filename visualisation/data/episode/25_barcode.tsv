Stan	46	0	Sgt. Stanley Marsh is trapped behind enemy lines. His only chance of survival is to sneak past the Bosnian guard who stands watch.  Sgt. Marsh knows it's now or never. He must make a run for it.  American base is only a few feet away.	[]
Cartman	16	0	What is this? Halt!  It will take more than your weak American weapons to destroy me!	[]
Stan	7	2	Cartman, we shot your Bosnian fat ass!	['fat', 'ass']

Cartman	8	0	--special armor, that's impenetrable to American bullets.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Dude! Every time we play Americans vs. Bosnians, you cheat!	[]

Cartman	11	0	Mom? Can we pull up the carpeting in the living room?	[]

Sharon	5	0	What are you doing, sweetheart?	[]
Stan	12	0	Getting a cookie. We're building a clubhouse and then we're--	[]
Sharon	54	1	You men are all alike. First you get a cookie and then you criticize the way I dress and then it's the way I cook! I suppose next you'll be telling me that you need your space and that I'm sabotaging your creativity. Go ahead, Stanley, get your God-damned cookie!	['damned']
Stan	1	0	'Kay.	[]
Mr. Garrison	14	0	And so, children, today we're gonna focus on American history, right Mr. Twig?	[]
Mr. Twig	11	0	Uh- that's right, Mr. Garrison. American history is very important--	[]
Kyle	6	0	When is Mr. Hat coming back?	[]
Mr. Garrison	4	0	What did you say?!	[]
Kyle	6	0	When is Mr. Hat coming back?	[]
Mr. Garrison	27	1	I told you to never mention that name in my classroom again! Mr. Hat is a two-timin' whore, and now we all learn from Mr. Twig!	['whore']
Stan	4	0	But Mr. Twig sucks.	[]
Class	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Mr. Garrison	37	0	That is enough! Mr. Hat is gone, and he isn't coming back, and I don't wanna hear it! Anyway, children, lets turn our history textbooks to page 105, which should be right after page 104...	[]
Cartman	8	1	So, how's your lame-ass clubhouse, Stan?	['ass']
Stan	5	1	Better than yours, fat boy.	['fat']
Cartman	21	0	We'll see about that.  Don't forget you need to cut school early and wait for the hot tub, Kenny.	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Yes, sir..!)	[]
Wendy	4	0	Is the clubhouse ready?	[]
Stan	1	0	Almost.	[]
Mr. Garrison	5	0	Stan? Are you paying attention?	[]
Stan	3	0	Yes, Mr. Garrison.	[]
Mr. Garrison	8	0	Well, then, Stanley. What did I just say?	[]
Stan	23	0	Um. You said that even though- Charo appeared twelve times on the Love Boat, the episode with Captain and Tennille got higher ratings.	[]
Mr. Garrison	39	0	...Well, okay. I suppose you were paying attention.  Anyway, children, the Love Boat did go on for about eight years. They tried to bring it back recently, but it didn't work. Probably 'cause Robert Urich had to weigh...	[]
Kyle	3	0	Good guess, dude!	[]
Stan	1	0	Phew.	[]
Bebe	3	0	Pass this up.	[]
Butters	3	0	Pass this up.	[]
Kevin	3	0	Pass this up.	[]
Fosse	6	0	P-huh pass this h-up.	[]
Mr. Garrison	7	0	Stanley, are you passing notes to Kyle?!	[]
Stan	3	0	No, I just--	[]
Mr. Garrison	8	0	Don't lie, Stan. Lying makes you sterile.	[]
Stan	9	0	I'm not lying. Someone just handed me the--	[]
Mr. Garrison	33	0	Stanley, if you think it's so important to keep interrupting my class, then why don't you come up to the front and read your note to Kyle for everyone to hear!	[]
Stan	7	0	But I didn't write the note!	[]
Cartman	13	0	Mr. Garrison, Stan's behavior is having an adverse effect on my education.	[]
Stan	3	0	Shut up, Cartman!	[]
Mr. Garrison	12	0	Stanley Marsh, you come up here right now and read your note!	[]
Stan	43	2	Oh, man.  Dear Kyle. You have got such a great ass. I could sleep for days on those perked cheeks, let me tell you. I'd like to live with you and wear your ass as a hat for all eternity. Whoa, dude!	['ass', 'ass']
Mr. Mackey	15	0	Now, young man, uh- school is a time for learning, mkay? Not for immature skylarkings.	[]
Stan	3	0	What's 'skylarkings'?	[]
Mr. Mackey	4	0	You know, like tomfooleries.	[]
Stan	1	0	Who?	[]
Mr. Mackey	5	0	Oh, your parents are here.	[]
Stan	2	0	Oh, no.	[]
Mr. Mackey	17	0	Thank you for coming on such short notice. I was just disciplining your son for his skylarkings.	[]
Randy	3	0	Stanley, I... Skylarkings?	[]
Mr. Mackey	1	0	Yeahmkay?	[]
Randy	15	0	Stanley, I want you to explain to me why you were passing notes in school.	[]
Sharon	21	0	Randy, let me handle this. Now Stanley, I want you to explain to me why you were passing notes in school.	[]
Stan	11	0	It wasn't my note, dude. It was some girl's.	[]
Mr. Mackey	15	0	Okay. Stanley, we're all here to get to the root of your behavior disorder.	[]
Sharon	6	0	You really should know better, Stanley.	[]
Randy	6	0	You need to shape up, mister.	[]
Sharon	17	0	Don't interrupt me! You always interrupt me when I talk! Can't you see that I--?	[]
Randy	5	0	I don't interrupt you.	[]
Sharon	9	0	There, you did it again!  He interrupted me again.	[]
Mr. Mackey	20	0	Okay, uh-- Perhaps you should let your wife finish talking, Mr. Marsh. Now, Stan, I want to you to be--	[]
Randy	13	0	Okay, I'm sorry I interrupt. But she always takes over any conversation!	[]
Mr. Mackey	9	0	Uh. U-uh, taking over any conversation's bad.	[]
Sharon	20	0	Like you're one to talk! When's the last time you really listened to what I had to say?!	[]
Mr. Mackey	3	0	Uuuhh. Mmm mkay.	[]
Randy	18	1	When was the last time you had anything interesting to say? It's always gossip and stupid crap!	['crap']
Mr. Mackey	23	0	Okay uh uh uh-apparently we have a bit of a communication problem here. Uh, Mr. Marsh, tell me how you're feeling.	[]
Randy	17	0	Well- uh, I feel like everything I do is wrong, it doesn't matter what I say.	[]
Mr. Mackey	8	0	Mkay. That's valid. Now, uh, Mrs. Marsh--	[]
Stan	2	0	Excuse me.	[]
Mr. Mackey	4	0	-how do you feel?	[]
Sharon	11	0	Like I'm a ghost. Like he sees right through me.	[]
Randy	2	0	Oh, please!	[]
Stan	1	0	Hello?	[]
Sharon	3	0	Oh, please yourself!	[]
Mr. Mackey	19	0	Who tries to control the marriage? And by that I mean, who's dominating the aspects of the relationship?	[]
Sharon	2	0	He is.	[]
Randy	3	0	No, she is.	[]
Sharon	10	0	Oh, I'm sorry! I guess I'm wrong again!	[]
Mr. Mackey	1	0	Mmkay.	[]
Cartman	13	0	Look at it, Kenny. It is the greatest clubhouse ever built.  Oh, man!	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Uh huh)	[]
Cartman	15	0	And we built it, with our own hands. Now all we need is chicks, Kenny.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Yeah!)	[]
Cartman	7	0	All right. You go find chicks, Kenny.	[]
Kenny	14	0	(Well, why do I have to be the one to go and find chicks?)	[]
Cartman	52	1	Because I have to stay here and work! I still have to shingle the roof, test the foundation, run all kinds of inspections. I've got way too much to do, and all you have to do is to go find chicks! Now, stop your bitchin'!  Mom, can I watch American Gladiators?	['bitchin']
Kyle	11	0	Dude! Where have you been? I've been waiting all afternoon.	[]
Stan	14	0	I got in trouble for that note Bebe was trying to pass to you.	[]
Kyle	2	0	To me??	[]
Stan	26	0	I mean, no. Not to you. Forget it. Come on, dude. We have to finish our clubhouse quick. The girls wanna play Truth or Dare tomorrow!	[]
Kyle	5	0	We should use nails, dude.	[]
Stan	6	0	My mom won't let us.	[]
Wendy	7	0	Hi, guys. How's the clubhouse coming?	[]
Stan	6	0	Pretty good. We're almost done.	[]
Wendy	8	0	Well, hurry! We wanna play Truth or Dare!	[]

Bebe	10	0	Kyle, could you turn around for a second?  Thank you.	[]
Stan	8	0	Come on, dude, we have to hammer faster.	[]
Kyle	11	0	Hey, Stan. Do you know how to play Truth or Dare?	[]
Stan	1	0	No.	[]
Kyle	12	1	Well dude, how the hell are we supposed to play it, then?	['hell']
Stan	7	0	I didn't even think about that.	[]
Chef	8	0	And then, they'll ask, Truth or Dare?'	[]
Stan	4	0	And I say, Dare!	[]
Chef	5	0	No no! You say, Truth.	[]
Stan	13	0	Truth? But that's boring! I want to get Dare to kiss her.	[]
Chef	15	0	You have to say Truth the first few times. Or else, you seem too eager.	[]
Stan	1	0	Oooh.	[]
Chef	21	0	You can't seem too eager. You've got to play it cool, like you don't even care what happens.	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Chef	9	0	Then, after a few Truths, you finally answer, Dare.	[]
Stan	1	0	Dare!	[]
Chef	8	0	But not like that, son. Like this: Daaare.	[]
Stan	1	0	Oooh.	[]
Chef	11	0	And then her little friend will dare you to kiss Wendy.	[]
Stan	4	0	You really think so?	[]
Chef	19	0	Of course she will. They're women. They've had this whole thing planned out months ahead of time.	[]
Stan	1	0	Wow!	[]
Fat Abbot	9	0	Heeyy hey hey. What's goin' down, y'all?	[]
Rudy	13	1	Man, Fat Abbot. What are you doin' on this side of the 'hood?	['fat']

Blonde	6	0	Hi. We ran away from home.	[]
Brunette	20	0	Well like, this kid told us we might be able to crash at your clubhouse for a couple of days.	[]
Cartman	7	1	Holy crap!  Behold! The Ewok Village 2000!	['crap']
Blonde	9	0	Oh well, I guess it beats living at home.	[]
Cartman	12	0	Can I offer you ladies a cool beverage or a tasty snack?	[]
Stan	1	0	Hello?	[]
Cartman	6	0	How's the clubhouse coming, Stan?	[]
Stan	5	0	We're working on it.	[]
Cartman	22	0	Well, I just thought I'd tell you that me and Kenny have finished our clubhouse, and we already have chicks over.	[]
Stan	5	0	No, you don't!  Dude!	[]
Cartman	26	2	It's only a matter of time before we're playin' Truth or Dare with them. Good luck with your piece of crap clubhouse, stupid asshole.	['crap', 'asshole']
Stan	18	1	Aw, that hunk of fat--  Mom, will you please ask Dad to come help me build my clubhouse?	['fat']
Sharon	12	0	Stanley, I think you should know that your father has moved out.	[]
Stan	2	0	What?! Why?	[]
Sharon	5	0	Because, we're divorced, Stanley.	[]
Stan	22	0	Divorced? On no. Does that mean you and Dad don't love me anymore? This is all my fault, isn't it?	[]
Sharon	3	0	Yeah, kind of.	[]
Stan	8	0	...Dude, you're not supposed to say that!	[]
Sharon	11	0	But I would like you to meet your new stepfather, Roy.	[]
Roy	2	0	Hello, son.	[]
Stan	1	0	What?!	[]
Sharon	9	0	I'll leave you two alone to get acquainted.	[]
Roy	68	0	Hello, Stanley. I know this must be a very difficult period for you right now, and the adjustment is going to take some time. But I'd like to be your friend. So when you're ready, I want you to feel free to come to me with anything you might need, whether it's advice, or- just someone to play catch with. You can count on me.	[]
Stan	6	0	This is happening way too fast.	[]
Roy	42	0	Oh, Jesus! When are you gonna cut me some slack, huh?! I have taken you under my wing and done my best, and all you ever do is whine and moan about it! Now, for the last time, go cut some firewood!	[]
Blonde	19	0	So, I'm on my way out the door, and she goes, Make sure you're home before midnight!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Ahaw, that's weak.	[]
Blonde	15	1	And I go, Listen, bitch! I don't need my mother giving me no curfew!	['bitch']
Cartman	3	0	That's killer.	[]
Blonde	19	0	And she goes, Yeah, well, if you're not home before midnight, don't bother coming home at all!	[]
Cartman	4	0	That's totally weak!	[]
Blonde	9	0	So I go, Fine! I won't come home!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Sweet.	[]
Blonde	23	2	And then she goes, Fine! Don't come home!, getting all up in my face and crap and acting all tough and crap.	['crap', 'crap']
Cartman	3	0	Killer weak, sweet!	[]
Blonde	35	0	I'm sixteen. I should be able to do what I want when I want.  I don't need her breathing down my neck every two seconds telling me what I can and cannot do!	[]
Cartman	39	0	I had the same thing with my mom the other day. I'm all like, Ey! I am not a little kid anymore! Ma, I'm eight years old! And if I wanna fingerpaint, then I'm gonna fingerpaint!	[]
Stan	4	0	Okay. We're done.	[]
Kyle	9	0	Dude, I don't think this is very sturdy.	[]
Stan	24	0	It doesn't matter, dude. It only has to last long enough to play Truth or Dare. I'm gonna go get the girls.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Okay.	[]
Stan	2	0	' G'oh?	[]
Sharon	6	0	Stanley, it's time to go!	[]
Stan	2	0	Go where?	[]
Sharon	13	1	Your bastard father has visitation rights, and this is his time with you.	['bastard']
Stan	10	0	But no! I have to get the girls to come-	[]
Sharon	3	0	Come on, Stanley!	[]
Stan	2	0	Weak!  Dad?	[]
Randy	40	0	Hey, Stanley, uh, hop in.  Listen, Stanley, I- I know all this change must be tough on you, but you know, your-your mother and I thought it'd be best for all of us if we'd split up.	[]
Stan	9	0	But I don't understand why we have to--	[]
Randy	3	0	Well, hello, ladies.	[]
Passenger	11	0	Hi, handsome. We're gonna be at Larry's Bar tonight.	[]
Randy	35	0	I'm already there.  What were we talking about? Oh yeah. See, your mother and I still care about you and your sister. But we just don't like being around each other any more.	[]
Stan	18	0	Well, I don't like being around my sister anymore; does that mean I can leave her, too?	[]
Randy	22	0	Well, no, because you're a family. You just can't leave family; you have to stick with family, no matter what.	[]
Stan	50	0	But you and Mom are family; how come you can just split up?  You know what I think? I think that when you and Mom got married, you became family. And now that you are, you shouldn't be able to leave her anymore than I can leave my sister.	[]
Randy	18	0	Hoho, Stan, you're so young. You just don't get it.  Well, anyway, have a nice day.	[]
Stan	4	0	What? That's it?	[]
Randy	30	0	Yeah. But I loved our time together. I hate to see it end. Go on, get out.  You know that nothing is more important to me than you, right, Stan?	[]
Stan	3	0	I guess, but--	[]
Stan	15	0	Okay, dude, the girls are gonna be here to play Truth or Dare any minute.	[]
Kyle	22	0	Stan, if I didn't know you better, I would almost think you're doing this because you wanna play with girls.	[]
Stan	7	0	No way, dude! Don't be silly.	[]
Bebe	3	0	Come on, Wendy.	[]
Stan	14	0	We have to say Truth a couple of times before we say Dare, right?	[]
Kyle	2	0	Right. Why?	[]
Stan	10	0	Because if we don't, we'll seem too eager.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Too eager to what?	[]
Stan	5	1	To say Dare, dumbass! Jeez.	['dumbass']
Wendy	2	0	Hi, guys.	[]
Stan	6	0	Oh, hi Wendy. What's up?	[]
Bebe	10	0	Don't you guys still wanna play Truth or Dare?	[]
Stan	5	0	Yeah! I mean, sure, whatever.	[]
Bebe	3	0	Then come on!	[]
Stan	7	0	Remember, Truth the first couple of times.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Okay.	[]
Bebe	5	0	Who wants to go first?	[]
