Narrator	48	0	Way up in the mountains in a small little town, The Main Street was being decorated all up and down. People stood in long lines, sometimes waiting hours or more, Because Christmas needs to be bought in a store. But out in the forest, not too far away...	[]
Narrator	11	0	...The little woodland critters were also preparing for their Christmas Day.	[]
Woodland Critters	30	0	It's almost time when the time is here, The time that's only once a year. We can hardly wait, 'cause it's so near. A Woodland Critter Christmas!	[]
Narrator	84	0	The little critters worked hard as they happily sang, And each one of them had a quite interesting name. There was Squirrely the squirrel, Rabbity the rabbit, Beavery the beaver, and Beary the bear. Porcupiney the porcupine, Skunky the skunk, Foxy the fox, and Deery the deer. Woodpeckery the woodpecker, Mousey the mouse, and Chickadee-y the chickadee, all made the forest their house. And on that magical day, stumbling upon all of that, was a surprised little boy, in a red poofball hat.	[]
Stan	3	1	What the hell?	['hell']
Singer	22	0	Christmastime is once a year Every critter holds it dear Every animal big or small Christmas means so much to us all	[]
Rabbity	7	0	Well, hello there. Welcome to our forest.	[]
Skunky	7	0	How do you like our Christmas tree?	[]
Stan	3	0	It's... nice.	[]
Beavery	10	0	Why, it's the most perfect tree in the forest!	[]
Mousey	6	0	Oh no, I see a problem.	[]
Deery	4	0	What is it, Mousey?	[]
Mousey	8	0	Our Christmas tree doesn't have a star.	[]
Critters	1	0	Awww.	[]
Beary	11	0	We can't have a tree with no star on it.	[]
Rabbity	5	0	What are we gonna do?	[]
Squirrely	17	0	Now don't be down, y'all. Maybe our new friend can help us find a star.	[]
Critters	11	0	Can you really? Oh would you please? Could you help us?	[]
Stan	2	0	Okay, okay.	[]
Critters	1	0	Yay!	[]
Narrator	22	0	And so, using some paper and working with glee, the boy in the red poofball hat made a star for the tree.	[]
Critters	1	0	Ohhhh!	[]
Beary	8	0	It's the nicest star I ever saw.	[]
Narrator	10	0	The little critters cheered and Beavery said with a smile...	[]
Beavery	13	0	How would you like to sing and dance with us for a while?	[]
Narrator	10	0	The boy in the red poofball hat smiled and said...	[]
Stan	8	0	Uh, no thanks, I'm gonna go home.	[]
Beavery	3	0	Goo- goodbye Stanny!	[]
Critters	9	0	Goodbye, Stanny! Bye! Cya! I'll buy your hat!	[]
Stan	1	0	Woof.	[]
Critters	2	0	Hi, Stanny!	[]
Stan	2	0	Oh, whatta?	[]
Narrator	18	0	His friends were all there! What a wonderful surprise! The little boy smiled with joy in his eyes!	[]
Stan	4	0	What time is it?!	[]
Squirrely	16	0	You aren't gonna believe what happened, Stanny. It's the most magical Christmas gift ever!	[]
Skunky	3	0	Porcupiney is pregnant!	[]
Stan	9	0	You guys, I have to go to school tomorrow.	[]
Mousey	13	0	I deduce the man-boy doesn't understand the seriousness of the fertilization.	[]
Deery	9	0	Porcupiney is a virgin, Stanny. Her conception was immaculate.	[]
Foxy	10	0	She's gonna give birth to our Lord and Savior.	[]
Stan	1	0	...What?	[]
Porcupiney	14	0	It has been foretold unto me that I would give birth on Christmas Day.	[]
Mousey	2	0	So soon!	[]
Skunky	2	0	How delightful!	[]
Woodpeckery	4	0	Our souls are saved!	[]
Chickadee-y	16	0	Finally the critters are gonna have a Savior of their very own, of their very own!	[]
Squirrely	18	0	There's just one problem: We don't have a manger for our Savior to be born in.	[]
Critters	1	0	Awwww.	[]
Beary	7	0	But we got to have a manger.	[]
Rabbity	12	0	Can you do it, Stan. Can you build us a manger? Huh?	[]
Critters	1	0	(Cheers)	[]
Narrator	25	0	Of course I'll build you a little manger! the little boy cried, and he winked at his critter friends and leapt to their side!	[]
Narrator	22	0	And out in the woods the boy steamed right ahead, making a place for the critter babe to lay its sweet head,	[]
Rabbity	12	0	Gee whiz, if it isn't the nicest manger I ever saw.	[]
Mousey	17	0	I deduce it shall serve as a perfectly suitable resting place, for the Son of our Lord.	[]
Raccoony	9	0	Does this mean we can go to sleep now?	[]
Porcupiney	11	0	My son will have the nicest bed in all the forest.	[]
Woodpeckery	4	0	Fit for a king!	[]
Squirrely	10	0	This is going to be the best critter Christmas ever!	[]
Woodland Critters	26	0	It's almost time when the time is here, The time that's only once a year. We can hardly wait, 'cause it's so near --	[]
Stan	6	0	All right, I'm going now.	[]
Critters	4	0	The mountain lion! Hide!	[]
Stan	3	0	Go away! Shoo!	[]
Squirrely	3	0	Is it gone?	[]
Mousey	4	0	I deduce it is.	[]
Skunky	7	0	I'm not c-c-comin' out.	[]
Foxy	20	0	Well, this is the end. The mountain lion obviously knows Porcupiney is pregnant, and he's gonna kill it again.	[]
Stan	1	0	Again?	[]
Squirrely	19	0	Every Christmas the mountain lion comes down and eats the virgin critter impregnated with the Son of our Lord.	[]
Porcupiney	7	0	Oh dear, I'm so very afraid.	[]
Beavery	14	0	Let's face it. The mountain lion will never let our Savior be born.	[]
Critters	1	0	Awwww!	[]
Squirrely	12	0	Hey, we shouldn't be upset this Christmas. We've got Stanny!	[]
Raccoony	20	0	Of course! Stanny can do anything! If he can build a manger, he can stop that mean ol' mountain lion!	[]
Porcupiney	3	0	Christmas is saved!	[]
Narrator	33	0	High up in the forest on a dark, craggy peak, the horrid mountain lion and preyed on the weak. For the critters to be saved, someone had to stop that nasty old cat...	[]
Stan	5	2	Goddammit, this is fucking ridiculous!	['goddammit', 'fucking']
Narrator	9	0	Said the little boy in the red poofball hat.	[]
Narrator	20	0	Killing a mountain lion was no easy task, But he thought of a plan, and he thought of it fast.	[]
Stan	20	0	Grrr! Grrr! Come on out!  Come on, critter killer! Your days of slaughtering innocent little animals are over! Rawrrrrr!  Rawrrrrr!	[]
Narrator	19	0	In a flash, it was over! A victorious blow! The mountain lion lay slain on the cold ground below.	[]
Stan	2	0	Okay, there.	[]
Lion Cub 1	8	0	Mommy? Mommy!  W... wake up, Mommy, wake up!	[]
Lion Cub 2	15	0	Don't leave us, Mommy.  Man-boy, why? Why did you kill our mommy? Why?	[]
Stan	9	0	I... the... critters. Their... bir-birth of a Savior?	[]
Narrator	18	0	The tiny cubs all gathered together and cried, All alone in the world because their mother had died.	[]
Stan	2	0	Aw- awww!	[]
Porcupiney	1	0	Oooo.	[]
Beary	5	0	You all right, Lady Porcupiney?	[]
Porcupiney	9	0	Oh yes, just felt a little kick is all.	[]
Beavery	20	0	Well, it's been much too long now. Uh I'm afraid our helpful friend Stanny must be very dead.	[]
Foxy	8	0	Yep, the mountain lion probably swallowed him whole.	[]
Rabbity	13	0	I guess that means our Savior is gonna be made into Savior stew.	[]
Critters	1	0	Awwww.	[]
Chickadee-y	4	0	Wait a minute, look!	[]
Critters	1	0	Stanny!	[]
Mousey	4	0	Stanny, you're alive.	[]
Beary	9	0	But, does that mean you killed the mountain lion?	[]
Stan	3	0	It's dead.	[]
Deery	5	0	For real and for true?	[]
Beavery	3	0	Are you sure?	[]
Stan	10	0	I'm sure. It won't be hurting you anymore.	[]
Squirrely	12	0	He did it! Now our Critter Christmas can finally happen! Hail Satan!	[]
Critters	2	0	Hail Satan!	[]
Stan	3	0	Wait, wha-what?	[]
Beavery	22	0	You've done us a huge favor, Stanny! Without the mountain lion around, the Lady Porcupiney can give birth to the Antichrist!	[]
Critters	1	0	Yaaay!	[]
Stan	13	0	Wai-wait, the Antichrist?? You said she was giving birth to your savior!	[]
Squirrely	11	0	Yeah, to the Son of our Lord, Satan, Prince of Darkness.	[]
Stan	9	0	But I thought you meant the Son of God!	[]
Deery	14	1	Well, think about it: You really think God would have sex with a porcupine?	['sex']
Chickadee-y	16	0	No way! Only Satan, Prince of Darkness and King of all Evil would do that! Yay!	[]
Foxy	14	0	This just calls for a celebration! Let's sacrifice Rabbity and eat his flesh!	[]
Rabbity	6	0	Yay! Sacrifice me to the Devil!	[]
Chickadee-y	6	0	Drink his blood! Drink his blood!	[]
Squirrely	2	0	Blood orgy!	[]
Critters	6	0	Yay, blood orgy! Blood orgy, yay!	[]
Critters	11	0	What special time and special day, It's Woodland Critter Christmas.	[]
Squirrely	2	0	Hail Satan.	[]
Narrator	85	0	In the gentle forest clearing on Christmas Eve morn, The little forest critters prepared for the Antichrist to be born. The noble mountain lion had stopped evil in all the years past, But now the good protector lay dead as the good owls amassed. And meanwhile, three lion cubs were crying away. For them, there would certainly be no Christmas Day. And soon the forest would suffer from the offspring Satan begat. All of this because of the little boy in the red poofball hat.	[]
Stan	1	0	Ugh.	[]
Narrator	18	0	Now that he'd killed the noble lion queen, there was nobody to stop the Apocalypse, it seemed.	[]
Stan	1	0	Uuugh!	[]
Narrator	22	0	I know! he said with a new happy grin, I'll go back to the forest and speak with those critters again!	[]
Stan	4	0	No, no-no-no.	[]
Narrator	55	0	He ran out the living room, turned out the light, and went back to the forest to set everything right! But his conscience caught up with him and to the forest he did flee... He thought he could hide from his problems - not true! He knew in his heart the thing he had to do!	[]
Stan	3	0	Leave me alone!!	[]
Narrator	11	0	He knew that only by going to the forest could he --	[]
Stan	7	0	All right, all right, all right! God!	[]
Beavery	9	0	Hey, look everyone! It's our old pal, Stanny.	[]
Woodpeckery	8	0	Oh boy, Stanny. You came just in time!	[]
Deery	7	0	Yeah. We've got a big problem.	[]
Squirrely	22	0	The Great Satan has commanded that when the Antichrist is born, we must find a human host body to transfer it into.	[]
Chickadee-y	12	0	That way he could take over the whole world! The whole world!	[]
Mousey	10	0	The human must be non-baptized and heathenistic against Christ.	[]
Beavery	6	0	We figured you'd be perfect!	[]
Critters	1	0	Yay!	[]
Stan	13	0	I'm not a heathen! I was baptized and my family's Christian!	[]
Critters	1	0	Awwwww.	[]
Beary	12	0	But we got to have a human host body for the Antichrist.	[]
Deery	13	0	Oh dear, maybe we won't have a critter C-Christmas after all.	[]
Squirrely	16	0	Now don't be down, y'all. Stanny can help us find non-baptized heathen human.	[]
Chickadee-y	4	0	Will you really, Stanny?	[]
Stan	29	0	No! I'm not doing you anymore favors and I'm not letting you give birth to the Antichrist!  I came here to put a stop to all this!	[]
Beavery	3	0	To stop us?	[]
Beary	21	0	But gee whiz, Stan, if you try to stop us, we'd have to use our evil Satanic powers on ya.	[]
Stan	16	0	Right, whatever.  I'm taking down the manger I built.  Ah!  Aaaah!  Aagh! Aaaahh!  AAAAAAAH! AAAAAAAH!	[]
Beary	9	0	Oh boy! Our Satanic powers sure did the trick!	[]
Chickadee-y	10	0	Our powers get stronger every day! Get stronger every day!	[]
Squirrely	18	0	Sorry Stanny, but you see, nothing can stop the birth of the Antichrist, except for a mountain lion.	[]
Skunky	6	0	And you got rid o'her.	[]
Critters	1	0	Yay!	[]
Narrator	25	0	The boy shook with anger! He broke a sweat and fell ill. Then he remembered there were three mountain cubs still alive on the hill!	[]
Stan	2	0	Oh yeah.	[]
Stan	4	0	Hello? Anybody in there?	[]
Lion Cub 3	10	0	Oh no, it's the man-boy who killed Mommy!	[]
Lion Cub 1	7	0	He's come to kill us now!	[]
Lion Cub 2	11	0	It's okay. I died inside when Mommy was killed anyways.	[]
Lion Cub 3	14	0	Yeah, better this than the slow death we'd face without a mother around.	[]
Stan	16	0	Look, I'm sorry I killed your mom. The, the squirrel told me she was evil.	[]
Lion Cub 1	15	0	You got tricked by a squirrel? Gee, you're not too smart, are you, mister?	[]
Stan	23	0	I'm trying to make this all right again, but the only thing that can stop devil-worshiping critters is a mountain lion!	[]
Lion Cub 3	5	0	Yeah, and you killed her.	[]
Stan	5	0	Well, you're mountain lions.	[]
Lion Cub 2	12	0	Us? No, we're just kids. We still have our baby teeth.	[]
Lion Cub 1	4	0	And our baby claws.	[]
Lion Cub 3	4	0	And a dead mom.	[]
Stan	15	0	There still has to be a way for you to kill the porcupine's baby.	[]
Lion Cub 3	7	0	What? You mean like in an abortion?	[]
Lion Cub 2	6	0	Yeah. An abortion. That can work.	[]
Lion Cub 1	9	0	But, we don't know how to give abortions.	[]
Lion Cub 3	9	0	Do you know some place we can learn, mister?	[]
Narrator	20	0	Where can they learn that? the boy said with a frown. I know! The abortion clinic just outside of town.	[]
Stan	1	0	What?!	[]
Narrator	20	0	So he picked up the cubs and down the mountain he stormed. And took them to where abortions are performed.	[]
Stan	4	0	No, he didn't.	[]
Narrator	3	0	Yes, he did.	[]
Stan	4	0	No, he didn't!	[]
Narrator	3	0	Yes, he did.	[]
Stan	4	0	No, he didn't!	[]
Narrator	3	0	Yes... he...  did!	[]
Stan	2	1	Oh, Goddammit!	['goddammit']
Narrator	17	0	Said the boy in the red poofball hat! We've made it already, little cubs! Fancy that!	[]
Doctor	7	0	Excuse me, what are you doing here?!	[]
Narrator	4	0	The abortion doctor inquired.	[]
Doctor	11	0	If you wanna be in the OR, a pass is required!	[]
Stan	26	0	I don't know, I- I'm supposed to show these mountain lions how an abortion is performed or something, I... I know, it's ridiculous.	[]
Doctor	42	0	Well, you're in luck, I'm happy to inform! It's only three days until Christmas, so I have lots of abortions to perform! Gather around my table, cute little lions, I'll teach you to do abortions without even tryin'!	[]
Narrator	22	0	And so the little boy and the cubs gathered around the chair base, And all day watched abortion after abortion take place.	[]
Singer	56	0	Christmas time is once a year. Every critter holds it dear. Every animal big or small, Christmas means so much to us all. It's once a year, it's Christmastime! And it happens once a year. It's once a year, it's Christmastime! When we hear about how Christmas only comes Once a year.	[]
Stan	12	0	This better have a point, dude. This really better have a point.	[]
Critters	17	0	It's almost time when the time is here, The time that's only once a year.	[]
Beary	8	0	Oh look. That little feller is all alone.	[]
Skunky	4	0	Gee, he looks sad.	[]
Critters	2	0	Hi there!	[]
Kyle	3	1	What the hell?	['hell']
Beavery	9	0	How come you're all alone on Christmas Eve.	[]
Kyle	6	0	My... family doesn't celebrate Christmas.	[]
Raccoony	3	0	Aww, but why?	[]
Kyle	9	0	Well, because, we don't really... believe in Jesus.	[]
Critters	1	0	Yay!	[]
Beary	8	0	But does that mean you aren't baptized?	[]
Kyle	4	1	No. I'm Jewish.	['jewish']
Critters	2	0	Yay! Yay!	[]
Beavery	7	0	You've got to come with us!	[]
Deery	6	0	You're perfect! Just pu-perfect!	[]

Critters	3	0	Yay! Woohoo! Woohoohoo!	[]
Critters	11	0	What special time and special day, It's Woodland Critter Christmas.	[]
Squirrely	2	0	Hail Satan.	[]
Narrator	42	0	'Twas the night before Christmas, and above the woods, way up high, a new bright shiny star hung in the sky. For the world to be saved there was only one shot, A little boy with three clubs and an abortion plot.	[]
Stan	20	0	Okay, come on, the critters are over this way. You mountain lions ready to stop the Antichrist from being born?	[]
Lion Cub 3	8	0	Sure. We know how to give abortions now.	[]
Narrator	19	0	He arrived at the critter forest ready to fight, but then gasped when he saw a most dreadful sight.	[]
Beavery	4	0	Gosh, we did it!	[]
Squirrely	14	0	The critter Antichrist is born, bringin' a thousand years of darkness to the forest.	[]
Narrator	20	0	The Antichrist had been born, sealing the world's fate. The boy in the red poofball hat... was too late.	[]
Stan	6	1	Too late?! The hell is that?!	['hell']
Beavery	3	0	Oh. Hiya, Stanny!	[]
Kyle	8	1	Stan! Stan, what the hell is going on?!	['hell']
Stan	8	1	It's Critter Christmas, dude! It sucks ass!	['ass']
Skunky	14	0	Now all we have to do is put the Antichrist into our human host.	[]
Critters	6	0	Let's go! All right! Woohoo!	[]
Stan	17	0	That's it?! Ten thousand years of darkness and I don't even have a Merry Christmas?!	[]
Narrator	25	0	When up in the sky the sound of sleigh bells were heard, And a jolly red sleigh flew down to the earth like a bird!	[]
Beavery	6	0	Wow, look, there's Santy Claus!	[]
Critters	1	0	Yay!	[]
Raccoony	5	0	Let's eat his flesh!	[]
Santa	18	1	All right, what the hell is going on?! Why is there a red star glowing in the sky?!	['hell']
Raccoony	17	0	We finally did it, Santa! We brought forth the Antichrist with help from our good friend, Stanny.	[]
Skunky	7	0	Death and pain await all living things.	[]
Santa	6	0	Little boy, you should be ashamed!	[]
Stan	15	0	I mean, I didn't mean to help them, I... I tried to stop them!	[]
Santa	14	0	Well good going, stupid! There's only one way to stop devil-worshiping critters!	[]
Critters	1	0	Aaaaah!	[]

Beary	11	0	Gee whiz, Santa, you're not gonna kill me, are you-	[]
Dark Cub	9	0	But Santa, what do we do about the Antichrist?	[]
Santa	16	0	Don't worry, boys. The Antichrist cannot survive without a human host body to go into.	[]
Kyle	10	0	No.  No, I want to have the Antichrist inside me!	[]
Stan	2	0	What?! Kyle?!	[]
Kyle	15	1	With his power, I can finally make the earth a better place for the Jews!	['jews']
Santa	5	0	Don't do it, Kyle!	[]
Stan	1	0	Dude!	[]
Kyle	16	1	Yes, yes! Now the Jews shall take control of Christmas once and for all! HAHA! HAAA!!	['jews']
Kyle	4	0	Oh, stop it, Cartman!	[]
Kyle	16	0	Just stop it! That's enough! You aren't reading another sentence of your stupid story!	[]
Cartman	15	0	I don't believe anyone interrupted you when you read your Christmas story aloud, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	20	1	This whole time your stupid story was just a way to rip on me for being Jewish at Christmas again!	['jewish']
Cartman	7	0	Mr. Garrison, could you do something, please?	[]
Mr. Garrison	23	0	Sorry, Eric, but if Kyle feels discriminated against, you'll have to stop or else I'll get a call from his mother.	[]
Cartman	5	0	All right, fine! Forget it!	[]
Butters	5	0	Well but, but what happened?	[]
Token	11	0	Yeah. Did Kyle bring a thousand years of darkness or not?	[]
Clyde	6	0	What happens to the lion cubs?	[]
Cartman	16	0	Well, I guess we'll never know, because Kyle doesn't wanna hear how it ends.	[]
Stan	17	0	No, it all worked out, right? The world was saved and I went home for Christmas dinner.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Dude, why do you care?!	[]
Stan	21	0	Well after all that I at least wanna know if I had a merry Christmas or if darkness rules the Earth.	[]
Kyle	19	0	Oh come on! It's obvious what happens! I get killed by Santa Claus so that Christmas is saved!	[]

Kyle	20	0	Oh God, what have I done?!  I'm sorry. Please, I don't wanna be the vessel for the Antichrist.	[]
Santa	16	0	I'm sorry, but it's too late, Kyle! Santa's gonna have to kill you!	[]
Stan	4	0	No Santa, don't!	[]
Santa	19	0	We don't have a choice. In a few hours, the dark creature inside him will consume his soul.	[]
Narrator	22	0	The little boy fretted. He almost started to bawl, But that's when he came up with the best idea of all.	[]
Stan	3	0	The lion cubs!	[]
Narrator	5	0	The little boy quickly begun,	[]

Santa	1	0	What?	[]
Stan	20	1	Now cubs, do like they showed you. Hurry up fast! Get the Antichrist out of my friend Kyle's ass!	['ass']
Narrator	22	0	And in the twinkling starlight, each little cub did their portion. They remembered all they had learned and gave Kyle an abortion.	[]
Kyle	11	0	Thanks, everybody. I'm sorry I got a little crazy there.	[]
Santa	23	0	Well little boy, it seems that you  have really been through a lot. Is there any special present you would like this year?	[]
