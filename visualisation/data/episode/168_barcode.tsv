Cartman	1	0	AHHHHHH.	[]
Dentist	13	0	Well, there's no doubt about it. Those tonsils need to come out.	[]
Cartman	1	0	What?	[]
Liane	7	0	Uh, what exactly does that entail, doctor?	[]
Dentist	24	0	It's a very simple operation. We'll just put you to sleep, Eric, and when you wake up you'll be tonsil-free!	[]
Cartman	11	0	No- No way. I'm not going to the hospital, Mom!	[]
Dentist	16	0	Oh, I thought you were a tough kid! You're not scared of hospitals, are you?	[]
Cartman	17	0	No, I'm not scared... I just- I don't want my tonsils out, that's all!	[]
Dentist	18	0	Well then I guess you don't want all the ice cream you get after the surgery, either.	[]
Cartman	2	0	...Ice cream?	[]
Dentist	24	0	It'd be a shame to have to give all that free ice cream to the big boys who aren't scared of hospitals.	[]
Liane	11	0	What do you say, champ? Think you can tough it out?	[]
Cartman	7	0	Well...you did say free ice cream?	[]
Liane	6	0	Poopsiekins, wake up. Wake up, honey.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Uh. It's over?	[]
Liane	7	0	That's right, you did it, Poopsiekins!	[]
Cartman	11	0	Its over! I didn't feel anything! You were right, Mom!	[]
Liane	7	0	I'm so proud of you, Eric.	[]
Cartman	8	0	All right, so where's my ice cream?	[]
Liane	8	0	Oh, here's the doctors now! Hi, doctor.	[]
Cartman	7	0	You were right, doctor! Everything is okay!	[]
Doctor	18	0	No, it's not. Eric, I'm afraid that we've accidentally infected you with the AIDS virus.	[]
Liane	1	0	...What!?	[]
Cartman	6	0	What's that supposed to mean?!	[]
Doctor	32	0	During the tonsil surgery we had to supply you with donor blood. A mistake was made and you were given blood contaminated with HIV. It was a one in a billion fluke.	[]
Cartman	3	0	I HAVE AIDS?	[]
Doctor	19	0	Not yet, but we've confirmed that you now have the virus that causes AIDS. We are very sorry.	[]
Cartman	9	0	SORRY?! YOU GAVE ME AIDS AND YOU'RE SORRY?!	[]
Liane	5	0	Oh, my poor little baby!	[]
Cartman	7	0	Mom, you said nothing would go wrong!	[]
Liane	4	0	Oh God!  Oh no!	[]
Cartman	16	0	No! No, this is a joke, right!? This is a joke; I can't have AIDS!	[]
Doctor	26	0	We're going to do everything in our power to make this up to you, Eric. For starters, I think I owe you some ice cream.	[]
Cartman	17	1	Fuck your ice cream! You said I'd be fine! You all said I'd be FINE!	['fuck']
Liane	6	0	Oh, oh, my baby has HIV!	[]
Cartman	2	0	NO! NOOOOOOOO!	[]
Principal Victoria	5	0	Thank you for coming, everyone.	[]
Principal Victoria	5	0	Boys, please take a seat.	[]
Stan	8	0	What's going on? Are we in trouble?	[]
Principal Victoria	25	0	Boys, the reason we called you all in is because one of your friends... has a serious illness. Eric Cartman has been diagnosed with HIV.	[]
Stan	1	0	...What?	[]
Butters	2	0	Oh no.	[]
Doctor 2	28	0	He's been to several specialists after a botched blood transfusion. The disease is in very early stages and completely manageable, but he's naturally a bit scared.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Cartman has HIV?	[]
Doctor 2	29	0	We need everyone to understand you can't get the virus from Eric. You can still give him hugs and even kisses. Don't be afraid of him, just-	[]
Kyle	6	0	Excuse me. Eric Cartman has HIV?	[]
Principal Victoria	27	0	All right, we're going to bring Eric in now, and let's all be as supportive as we can and show him lots of love, okay?	[]
Mr. Mackey	12	0	Eric? Come on in, your friends want to say Hi, m'kay?	[]
Kyle	2	0	...No. Way.	[]
Butters	30	0	How ya doin', Eric? You know, I think you're a real special little guy, and even though you have AIDS, I ain't gonna act any different towards you.	[]
Cartman	6	2	God damn it, this sucks ass!	['damn', 'ass']
Kyle	10	0	...Excuse me, I have to step out for a minute.	[]
Butters	8	0	Poor Kyle. He's really taking it hard.	[]
Cartman	17	0	Is Kyle laughing out there!? This isn't a time for funny jokes, I'm gonna die!	[]
Doctor 2	26	0	No, you're not going to die, Eric. AIDS isn't as big a deal as it used to be. There are advances in treatment and-	[]
Cartman	28	0	Not a big deal!? Is that how everyone feels!? People need to understand the seriousness of this illness, and the bravery of the people who struggle with it!	[]
M.C.	22	0	We are here tonight to salute the bravery and the courage of one very special little boy who is living with HIV.	[]
Cartman	5	1	Where the hell is everybody?	['hell']
Liane	14	0	Excuse me, shouldn't we wait for everyone to arrive before we get started?	[]
Waitress	10	0	This is everyone. We didn't sell that many tickets.	[]
Butters	3	0	Great benefit, Eric!	[]
Jimmy	6	0	The Italian meatballs are fa-fantastic.	[]
Cartman	4	0	So this is it?	[]
Waitress	27	0	I'm afraid AIDS benefits aren't as popular as they used to be. AIDS was more the '80s/'90s disease. It's all about cancer now.	[]
Cartman	22	1	Well that's just great! Of all the times to get AIDS, I get it right when everyone stops givin' a crap!	['crap']
M.C.	25	0	With all of your help, we have raised over seventeen dollars for AIDS tonight, and that money will certainly go towards helping little Eric Markman.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Just bring out Elton John already!	[]
M.C.	19	0	Uh we're sorry, Elton couldn't make it. He- uh, he had to play at a cancer benefit.	[]
Waitress	10	0	It's all right, we got somebody better: Jimmy Buffett!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Jimmy Buffett?!	[]
Jimmy Buffett	21	0	Hello everyone. I wrote this song for a very brave little boy. AIDSburger in paradise! AIDSburger and it ain't nice!	[]
Cartman	14	0	Nobody likes Jimmy Buffett except for frat boys and alcoholic chicks from the South!	[]
Jimmy Buffett	36	0	A little boy in South Park Dyin' of AIDS in the cold dark How he got AIDS I haven't a clue. Wastin' away again because of AIDS and stuff How are we all feelin' tonight?	[]
Cartman	7	2	Fuck you, Jimmy Buffett! You fuckin' suck!	['fuck', 'fuckin']
Liane	4	0	Ohoho poopsiekins, be nice.	[]
Cartman	7	2	Fuck you Mom, I have fucking AIDS!	['fuck', 'fucking']
Cartman	12	0	Hey guys, thanks a lot for comin' to my AIDS benefit yesterday.	[]
Stan	7	0	Oh dude, was that yesterday? We forgot.	[]
Cartman	31	0	Yeah, you forgot. Just like a lot of people lately have forgot that AIDS is still killing people! Seems like all of America has forgot that HIV is a serious disease.	[]
Stan	9	0	Well, did... Elton John sing a song for you?	[]
Cartman	18	1	...No, as a matter of fact, Jimmy Buffett came instead.  Oh yeah, it's real fuckin' funny, Kyle!	['fuckin']
Kyle	18	0	I'm sorry. I'm. I'm really. Cartman, I f-I feel really bad for you. Honestly.	[]
Cartman	4	0	No you don't!	[]
Kyle	2	0	I do.	[]
Cartman	20	2	If you really felt bad, you'd wipe that fucking smirk off your face!  Well any God damned second, Kyle!	['fucking', 'damned']
Kyle	7	0	I'm sorry. I gotta go home.	[]
Cartman	7	1	Jesus Christ, can you believe that asshole?!	['asshole']
Stan	13	0	He does feel bad for you, Cartman; he just thinks it's... ironic.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Ironic how?	[]
Stan	14	1	Well, you know, you're always such a dick and stuff, and, and now...	['dick']
Cartman	11	0	Oh, and what?! I deserve it?! Is that what you think?!	[]
Stan	9	0	Not me! That's, uh, kinda what he thinks.	[]
Cartman	22	0	Nobody deserves this illness, Stan, Kenny! Nobody! It's awful! And maybe somebody needs to teach Kyle how to have some compassion!	[]
Butters	6	0	Oh, uh-okay, it's clear.	[]
Cartman	10	0	All right, get that rope ready to hoist me up.	[]
Butters	8	0	Okay, but... what are you going to do?	[]
Cartman	26	0	Kyle thinks that HIV is funny, so we're gonna make him look funny, and then he'll know how it feels to be laughed at.	[]
Butters	18	0	I just uh... well I don't know if I should be helping you make Kyle look silly.	[]
Cartman	16	0	Butters, helping people who have AIDS is one of the most important things you can do.	[]
Butters	13	0	I know, but are you sure Kyle has to be taught a lesson?	[]
Cartman	10	0	I'm not just sure, Butters. I'm HIV-positive.	[]
Butters	9	0	Oh yeah, uh-well I guess that's true.	[]
Cartman	19	0	All right, now get the rope up over that third rafter above the window; that's the easiest access.	[]
Butters	8	0	Wow, you really know what you're doing.	[]
Cartman	32	1	Yeah, I've sneaked into Kyle's room lots of times.  You think HIV is something to be laughed at, Kyle? Well...  let's just see how funny it is now, asshole.	['asshole']
Kyle	1	0	Wagh.	[]
Sheila	16	0	There there, bubbe, you'll be okay.  Oh doctor, did you find anything? Is it strep?	[]
Dr. Doctor	5	0	No, it isn't strep...	[]
Sheila	6	0	Oh, well there's a relief.	[]
Dr. Doctor	10	0	...Mrs. Broflovski, has your son ever had a blood transfusion?	[]
Sheila	2	0	No, why?	[]
Dr. Doctor	9	2	Little boy, have you been having unprotected anal sex?	['anal', 'sex']
Kyle	2	0	What? No?!	[]
Sheila	5	0	Doctor, what are you saying?	[]
Dr. Doctor	13	0	We've run every test imaginable... little Kyle here is infected with HIV.	[]
Kyle	1	0	What?	[]
Sheila	1	0	HIV?	[]
Dr. Doctor	15	0	It took us a long time to narrow it down, but there is no doubt.	[]
Sheila	4	0	No, that's impossible!	[]
Dr. Doctor	17	0	Little boy, are you sure you haven't taken it up the hoohoo just once or twice?	[]
Kyle	32	2	No! No God damn it no! I'm telling you you're wrong! There, there's no way I can have HIV! Unless maybe...  Oh my God. That son of a bitch!	['damn', 'bitch']
Sheila	2	0	Kyle? Kyle!	[]
Cartman	16	1	Pass me the ball!  Pass me the ball, Craig, you stupid asshole!  Kyle, what the F?!	['asshole']
Kyle	6	0	I'm gonna kill you, Cartman!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Kyle, what?!	[]
Stan	4	0	What did he do?	[]
Kyle	5	0	Why do I have HIV?!	[]
Clyde	1	0	...Oh...	[]
Cartman	15	0	Oh, you have HIV, huh Kyle? Guess it isn't so funny now, is it?	[]
Kyle	4	0	What did you do?!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Nothing!	[]
Kyle	15	0	Then why did Butters say he helped you sneak into my room last Friday night?!	[]
Cartman	7	0	Oh nice, Butters, you big tattle-tale.	[]
Kyle	9	0	Tattle-tale?! Do you know how serious this is?!	[]
Cartman	11	0	Well, Kyle, maybe I was just trying to prove a p-	[]
Kyle	1	0	AAAAAAA!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Kyle!	[]
Kyle	6	0	Here you go!  Here you go!	[]
Mr.Mackey	17	0	Hey! Hey, that's enough! Break it up, m'kay?!  Break it up! Hm'kay?!  M'kay!	[]
Principal Victoria	10	0	All right, boys, now what is this fighting all about?	[]
Kyle	4	0	He gave me AIDS!	[]
Principal Victoria	1	0	What?	[]
Kyle	8	0	He purposely infected me with his HIV virus!	[]
Principal Victoria	9	0	Is that true, Eric? Did you give Kyle AIDS?	[]
Cartman	22	2	Well he was being a total dick! And he's a big tattle-tale and going around and talking crap about me!	['dick', 'crap']
Principal Victoria	11	0	Did you infect Kyle with the HIV virus, yes or no?!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Kind of.	[]
Mr. Mackey	17	0	Eric, that is not appropriate behavior, m'kay? You cannot purposely infect other kids with your disease!	[]
Principal Victoria	10	0	That's right. I think you owe Kyle an apology.	[]
Cartman	3	0	I'm sorry.	[]
Kyle	2	0	An apology?!	[]
Principal Victoria	6	0	You're sorry for what, Eric?	[]
Cartman	8	0	I'm sorry for giving you AIDS, Kyle.	[]
Principal Victoria	16	0	That's better. And now Kyle, maybe you should also admit you were wrong for tattling.	[]
Kyle	1	0	...What?!	[]
Mr. Mackey	20	0	Kyle, the thing about tattlin' is, eh tattlin's bad. M'kay, because nobody likes a tattle-tale, m'kay?	[]
Kyle	8	0	A tattle-tale?! He infected me with AIDS!	[]
Cartman	13	0	See? He's tattling again. He hasn't learned a thing you guys.	[]
Cartman	28	0	Well Kyle, I guess we're even now. Shall we just call it a truce? Kyle? Shall we call it Even Stevens now?  Kyle, where are you going?	[]
Kyle	9	0	I'm going to break everything that you own!	[]
Cartman	12	0	What's that supposed to mean? Kyle?  Kyle, no! I apologized, Kyle!	[]
Cartman	68	3	Kyle! Kyle, hold on, you asshole!  What the fuck are you doing?!  Kyle, stop it!  God damn it, don't!  Kyle, no! Not Clyde Frog! Leave Clyde Frog alone!  NO!!  AHH! Clyde Frog!! Clyde Frog you ba- no! Not the Xbox, Kyle!  Not the X-wait! WAIT A SECOND!  I'm sorry I gave you HIV, all right?! Just give me a chance, and I can cure you!	['asshole', 'fuck', 'damn']
Kyle	6	1	There is no cure, you asshole!	['asshole']
Cartman	13	0	No, no, listen, Kyle! I'm on to something. There really is hope.	[]
Kyle	2	0	What hope?!	[]
Cartman	8	0	Break my Xbox and you'll never know.	[]
Kyle	3	0	You're lying!	[]
Cartman	14	0	NO! No-al-, all right Kyle! Magic Johnson, Kyle! The key is Magic Johnson.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Magic Johnson?	[]
Cartman	5	0	He was a basketball player.	[]
Kyle	2	0	So what?!	[]
Cartman	68	0	So he got HIV like fifty years ago, and he's still totally fine! Magic Johnson has some kind of resistance to the virus, Kyle. I've been researching it since I got infected. If we can track him down and isolate his genetic prototype, we have a chance of beating this thing, buddy.  You and me, Kyle. We can overcome our illness; I swear it to you!	[]
Kyle	17	0	You better! 'Cause if you don't find a cure for HIV, I will break your Xbox!	[]
Cartman	2	0	My God...	[]
Cartman	11	0	We need two tickets to Los Angeles as soon as possible.	[]
Clerk	16	0	Los Angeles. Okay, uh I have a two o'clock flight. That would beee... $400 each.	[]
Cartman	19	0	Ah, sir, you don't understand. We have to see Magic Johnson right away. You see, we have AIDS.	[]
Clerk	20	0	...AIDS? Wow, that's really... retro. But ah I'm sorry. I- I just can't give away free seats.	[]
Cartman	37	0	Don't you get it?! We are two pals afflicted with an illness, and who only have each other in a race against time! Innocent playful children who are stricken with a deadly disease for no reason!	[]
Kyle	9	0	Oh please, no reason! I got AIDS from him!	[]
Clerk	7	0	Oh, you boys are  like that, huh?	[]
Kyle	1	0	NO!	[]
Clerk	11	0	Are you sure you boys just don't have any cash?	[]
Cartman	9	0	We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive.	[]
Clerk	23	0	Uh, we sometimes offer free seats to cancer patients, but AIDS I d-. Heh-hey Mitch? Do we have any AIDS patient policies?	[]
Cartman	12	0	Forget it, all right?! We'll use another airline! One that cares!	[]
Flight Attendant	20	0	We're so happy to help accommodate you brave boys. What kind of cancer did you say you have again?	[]
Cartman	7	0	Oh uh, you know, all over cancer.	[]
Flight Attendant	4	0	I'm so sorry	[]
Cartman	17	0	Yeah, well, at least  it's not as bad as having AIDS. AIDS is the worst disease.	[]
Flight Attendant	16	0	Hm, I don't know. These days I think I'd rather have AIDS than cancer.	[]
Cartman	28	0	No you wouldn't! Look, shouldn't you be serving people drinks or something?! Get outta here!  We're on our way, buddy.  Magic Johnson, here we come.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Don't. Touch me.	[]
Cartman	6	0	I know. I'm scared too.	[]
Butler	50	0	Magic. Magic, could you come to the front for a minute? There are a couple of boys here to see you. Two brave little buddies who against all odds have journeyed across America to find the cure for AIDS. All they have are each other in a race against time.	[]
Kyle	25	0	Thank you for seeing us, Mr. Johnson. We were hoping that maybe you have some kind of key that can help us with our disease.	[]
Magic	9	0	You boys both have the virus? Are you sure?	[]
Cartman	9	0	We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive.	[]
Kyle	14	0	Will you stop it with that?! What part of this is funny to you?!	[]
Cartman	8	0	Kyle, we need to try to find a-	[]
Kyle	13	0	What part of being infected with a deadly disease do you find funny?!	[]
Cartman	8	0	I don't think it's funny, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	29	1	Then stop saying you're not just sure, you're HIV-positive!  This isn't funny, AIDS isn't funny, dying isn't funny, so shut the fuck up!	['fuck']
Cartman	41	0	Well excuse me, Kyle, for trying to keep some optimism, you know? I mean, sometimes when things... seem their darkest you just need to try and stay... HIV-positive, but if you wanna be so HIV-negative all the time, I-	[]
Kyle	11	0	Knock it off! Right now! This isn't funny! At all!	[]
Cartman	3	0	Are you sure?	[]
Kyle	1	0	Yes!!	[]
Cartman	8	1	Are you HIV-positive?  Aarrhh! Ow, fuck, Kyle!	['fuck']
Magic	32	0	Boys, the truth is I don't know why my body is so resistant to the virus. I would love to know so I could help others, but I just don't.	[]
Kyle	28	0	Well I've been thinking: maybe there's something you've come into contact with that hinders HIV from growing. Do you mind if we just look around?	[]
Magic	4	0	Well, not at all.	[]
Magic	42	0	The pool is over there , where I try to swim and stay in shape. My kitchen  is full of pretty healthy food. I don't know which thing it is that keeps my T-cell count high, so I... try it all.	[]
Kyle	23	0	But everyone tries that. There has to be something you're exposed to that others aren't. Could we see where you sleep?	[]
Magic	1	0	Sure.	[]
Magic	7	0	Just a pretty plain old ordinary bedroom.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Dude.	[]
Magic	15	0	Oh, oh yeah, I- I don't trust banks. I sleep with all my money.	[]
Kyle	6	0	You sleep with money. Every night?	[]
Magic	13	0	Yeah, I like to keep it close b- ...You don't think that..?	[]
Scientist 1	43	0	It's incredible. Mitch, these boys could be onto something. Take a look.  That's a sample of HIV-infected blood. You can clearly see the HIV attacking the white blood cells, right?  All right. Watch what happens when we introduce some cash.	[]
Mitch	7	0	My God. The HIV particles are receding!	[]
Scientist 1	11	0	The cash does seem to retrain the HIV cells from stabilizing.	[]
Scientist 2	15	0	Now hold on! All the cash is doing is destabilizing the virus, not destroying it.	[]
Kyle	14	0	Well look, if being around lots of cash negatively affects the HIV, then maybe...	[]
Mitch	14	0	Then maybe enough cash shot directly into the bloodstream could kill the virus altogether.	[]
Magic	15	0	I have enough cash for all three of us! We should give it a try!	[]
Scientist 2	18	0	Na-noo, it's ridiculous. We need FDA approval, control studies! I'm sorry, but this is impossible!	[]
Magic	24	0	These boys have shown us that a lot of impossible things can happen.  Their friendship has conquered every obstacle in their illness-ridden lives.	[]
Scientist 2	16	0	Their incredible friendship has brought a sparkle of hope to our world, that's for sure.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Wugh.	[]
Scientist 2	29	0	I suppose we could try to distill Magic's cash down to its... most highly-concentrated level and... try it on one of them. But it's very risky.	[]
Cartman	21	0	Yeah well, if there's a chance of being cured of this illness, then Kyle is willing to take that risk.	[]
Mitch	7	0	Let's hope to Christ this works.	[]
Scientist 1	29	0	Wait a minute... Yes... Yes, take a look!  The cash particles have completely replaced all the HIV in Kyle's blood!  Boys, you just found the cure for AIDS.	[]
Cartman	2	0	All right!	[]
Scientist 1	10	0	They found the cure for AIDS!  The cure for AIDS!	[]
Scientist 3	3	0	What is it?	[]
Scientist 1	11	0	Large doses of concentrated cash!  Get the media on the phone!	[]
Scientist 4	2	0	All right!	[]
Anchorman	20	0	Scientists have just discovered the cure... for AIDS.  About a hundred and eighty thousand dollars shot directly into the bloodstream.	[]
Driver	19	0	Hey! They just found the cure for AIDS! You just have to inject yourself with all your cash! Woohoo!	[]
M.C.	40	0	I am pleased to announce that there is no trace of the HIV virus in either Kyle Broflovski or Eric Cartman.  Together these boys beat their illness. With nothing but each other, and overcoming all odds , these two brave friends-	[]
Kyle	15	0	Oh stop! We're not friends! He's the one who infected me with AIDS!	[]
M.C.	21	0	These two brave lovers found the cure and helped the world. And so, to honor these boys , here is... Jimmy Buffett!	[]
Cartman	3	0	What?! Aw, no!	[]
Jimmy Buffett	9	0	Cureburger in paradise! Cureburger. There I said it twice!	[]
Cartman	21	1	What?! Aw, God damn it!  Well I'll tell you this, Kyle. I'm never gettin' my tonsils out again, hahahaha.	['damn']
Kyle	6	0	I'm still breaking your Xbox.	[]
Cartman	5	0	What? No. No.  Kyle, no!	[]
