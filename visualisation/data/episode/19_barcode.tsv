Announcer	16	0	And now back to Huntin' and Killin with South Park's favorite hunters, Jimbo and Ned!	[]
Jimbo	13	0	Hi, I'm Jimbo Kern, and this here is Ned. Say hi, Ned.	[]
Ned	3	0	M-hi, Ned.	[]
Jimbo	106	2	Arrgh-ha-ha-ha! Now, isn't that great?  We have a terrific show for you today: we're gonna kill some elk, and we're gonna kill some mountain goats. Now, the new law passed by Colorado legislature, which Ned and I call Pussy Law #4, states that we can no longer kill animals in defense. (PUSSY LAW #4 NO ANIMAL SHALL BE HARMED, EVEN IN SELF DEFENSE, UNLESS SPECIFIC LICENSE AND SEASON IS IN ORDER. SELF DEFENSE CAN ONLY BE JUSTIFIED BY EXTREME, PROVABLE PERIL AND OR DOCUMENTED VISIBLE BODILY HARM.) In other words, our old line of, It's comin' right for us--	['pussy', 'pussy']
Ned	6	0	It's comin' right for us.	[]
Jimbo	65	0	--no longer works. So now, we only kill naimals to, quote, thin out their numbers. If we don't hunt, then these animals will grow too big in number and they won't have enough food. So you see, we have to kill animals, or else they'll die.  Uhh... So roll the tape.  Here we are at Shafer's Crossing, lookin' for some animals.	[]
Jimbo	12	0	Lookie, Ned, there's some deers!  Quick, Ned! Thin out their numbers!	[]
Ned	4	0	Thin out their numbers!	[]
Jimbo	8	0	Good work, Ned. Now they won't starve.	[]
Jimbo	13	0	That sure was a great hunting trip. We saved those deer from extinction.	[]
Ned	4	0	Mmm-we're environmentalists.	[]
Jimbo	27	0	Comin' up next, we're gonna drop some napalm on an unsuspecting family of beavers. And also, try to thin out the numbers of some endangered species.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Mr. Garrison, what's Vietnam?	[]
Mr. Garrison	42	0	What's Vietnam? A question a child might ask, but not a childish question. Heheheheheheheheheh. Children, for the next few days, we'll be learning all about Vietnam. Chances are that somebody in your own lives was affected by this incredible war.	[]
Mr. Hat	12	0	That's right, Mr. Garrison. The Vietnam War was sticky and icky.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Mr. Garrison, were you in Vietnam?	[]
Injured Man	2	0	Aaawwwgh... Aaawwwgh...	[]
Leader	11	0	Come on, men! Let's go! Jump out of the chopper!	[]
Man 1	7	0	Who's next to take a shower?	[]
Man 2	2	0	Me-ee!	[]
Man 3	2	0	I am.	[]
Man 1	7	0	You just took one last week, silly.	[]
Man 2	8	0	Oh, where can I hide this big pipe?	[]
Mr. Garrison	25	0	No, I wasn't in Vietnam, but sometimes, I like to pretend I was. Anyway, children, I'm going to assign you all a paper.	[]
Class	1	0	Awww..!	[]
Cartman	4	1	Son of a bitch.	['bitch']
Mr. Garrison	20	0	I want you all to find somebody in your own life who was in Vietnam and interview them about it.	[]
Clyde	11	0	What if we don't know anybody who was in Vietnam?	[]
Mr. Garrison	23	1	Then you get an F, fail the third grade, and have to get a job cleaning septic tanks to support your drug habit.	['drug']
Clyde	1	0	Oh.	[]
Stan	7	0	Dude, my uncle Jimbo was in Vietnam.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Hey, yeah! He and Ned do that stupid TV show.	[]
Jimbo	132	0	And now, time for Jimbo's Mysteries of the Unexplained.  One of our loyal viewers from South Park sent us some 8mm film of what he claims to be the Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka. Now, as you all know, the Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka can supposedly kill you with one horrid gaze. If a person even so much as looks into the frog's eyes, they can be paralyzed, or even die. And this film proves that that frog may very well exist.  Now watch carefully, you're gonna see the Mexican staring frog.  There! There, did you see it? Roll that back again!  Now, freeze it!  Well, I'd like to know what all you skeptics have to say now! What do you think, Ned?	[]
Ned	5	0	M-whoa, I'm scared.	[]
Jimbo	47	0	Well, be sure to join us next time. Until then... We're so glad you spent your time with us While we slaughtered our way through nature's guts Come again and stay a while We'll kill a lot more living things to make them bleed	[]
Ned	3	0	Mm-good night.	[]
Cameraman	8	0	A-and we're cut. Great show, guys.	[]
Jimbo	22	0	Oh, lookie who's here. My little nephew Stanley.  So, you're interested in your Uncle Jimbo's big TV show, huh?	[]
Stan	22	0	No. We have to do a stupid report on Vietnam. You and Ned are the only guys we know who were there.	[]
Jimbo	5	0	Oh. Yeah, we sure were.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Was it fun?	[]
Kyle	14	1	Cartman! What kind of stupid-ass question is that?! Of course it was fun!	['ass']
Jimbo	42	1	Well, sure, Vietnam was fun. But not like goin-to-the-circus fun, or fly-fishin-in-Montana fun. No, Vietnam was more like shovin' shards of broken glass up your ass and then sittin' in a tub of Tabasco sauce fun.	['ass']
Stan	1	0	Whoa!	[]
Jimbo	8	0	Yepper, that's where me and Ned met.	[]
Jimbo	10	0	I remember I had just gotten off the Ferris wheel.	[]
Jimbo	6	0	Oh, boy, what a gorgeous day!	[]
Sergeant	22	0	Kern, get over here! The new privates are here. I'm assigning one of them to you as a trainee. Ned Gerblansky.	[]
Ned	4	0	Ned Gerblansky reporting, sir.	[]
Sergeant	33	0	Thanks, Ned. Now, the bad guys have been spotted about ten klicks north of here. I know that you and Kern are best suited to take them out. Are you up for it?	[]
"Jimbo, Ned"	3	0	Sir, yes, sir!	[]
Jimbo	15	0	Soon it was all on just me and Ned to win the war for America.	[]
Jimbo	8	0	Pass me some more cocoa, will you, Ned?	[]
Ned	9	0	Certainly. And would you like another muffin as well?	[]
Jimbo	18	1	Why the hell not? We're at war.  Hey, you know those things are bad for your throat.	['hell']
Ned	14	0	No, that's all lies. I'll be fine. Charlies at 2 o'clock!	[]
Jimbo	6	0	I see 'em! Drop the bomb!	[]
Ned	5	0	The bomb's not releasing!	[]
Jimbo	2	0	Oh, no!	[]
Ned	4	0	It won't budge.	[]
Jimbo	6	0	Then we only have one option.	[]
Ned	5	0	What are you doing, man?!	[]
Jimbo	15	1	We have to take 'em out, Ned! At all costs! Die, you red commie bastards!	['bastards']
Ned	1	0	Yaaarrrggghhh!!!	[]
Jimbo	16	0	Aaarrrggghh-- Oh no! Out of ammo!  We did it, Ned! We killed the entire Vietcong Army!	[]
Ned	1	0	Whoopie.	[]
Jimbo	16	0	Let's get back to base camp. We can ride the log ride before it closes!	[]
Jimbo	8	0	And that's the way it happened, boys.	[]
Stan	1	0	Wow!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Man, Vietnam was sweet!	[]
Cameraman	9	0	Great news, guys. Your TV show ratings have doubled!	[]
Jimbo	1	0	Wow!	[]
Cameraman	8	0	They've gone from six people to twelve.	[]
Jimbo	7	0	Holy smokes! We could get an Emmy!	[]
Producer	19	0	We've got to do it, J. Your ratings are being killed by the Jimbo and Ned Hunting Show.	[]
Jesus	8	0	But I don't really care about that.	[]
Producer	30	0	Wuhell, you'd better care, Mr. Smarty Pants. No ratings means no show. If you want to keep reaching out to people, you have to keep up with the times.	[]
Jesus	2	0	Ohh, alright.	[]
Cameraman	8	0	Alright, we're ten second to air, guys.	[]
Producer	4	0	Remember, big, big, big!	[]
Cameraman	4	0	And five, four, three...	[]
Announcer	33	0	It's your hour of power on midday Mountain Cable Access. Put your hands together and welcome the only man in town who always has a fully-stocked wine cellar, Jeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-sus Christ!	[]
Jesus	44	0	Uhhh... Hi.  Uh, yeh-yeah, okay. Beginning today, we're taking the show in a new direction.  We've got some very interesting people coming on the show this week for you, our viewers. Today's guest is: TV's Gilligan, Mr. Bob Denver.	[]
Announcer	4	0	Here's  Booooobbb Denver.	[]
Jesus	3	0	Hi, Bob Denver.	[]
Bob	6	0	Hi, Jesus. Great to be here.	[]
Jesus	9	0	So. Bob. So, yu-you just get in town?	[]
Bob	4	0	Yup. Just got in.	[]
Jesus	10	0	So... Um... Su-so, wwhat have you been up to?	[]
Bob	6	0	Nn-nothing. Nothing really at all.	[]
Disciples vocalist	9	0	Nothin' from nothin' leaves nothin'   You gotta have something	[]
Jesus	2	0	Oh boy.	[]
Stan	49	0	...and after killing the entire Vietcong Army, they returned to base camp.  Once there, they rode the Devil's Drop roller coaster  and ate cotton candy. And ultimately, Ned got the Purple Heart for his courageous defense of the log ride.  So was the horror of Vietnam. The end.	[]
Boys	2	0	The end.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Are there any questions?  Yes, Mr. Garrison?	[]
Mr. Garrison	12	2	Yes.  Where the fuck did you hear this ridiculous load of bullshit?	['fuck', 'bullshit']
Stan	3	0	From Vietnam veterans.	[]
Mr. Garrison	26	0	Well, boys, it's obvious to me that you didn't do your work, and that you stayed up all night thinking up some ridiculous lie.	[]
Stan	5	0	No, no, we didn't--	[]
Mr. Garrison	6	0	You all receive an F... minus.	[]
Kyle	6	0	F-minus? Can he do that?	[]
Stan	10	0	Bu-but we're not making it up, it was--	[]
Mr. Garrison	17	0	Stanley, the Vietnam War was war! There weren't galloping steeds or singing birds or log rides.	[]
Kyle	9	0	How do you know? You weren't even there.	[]
Mr. Garrison	15	0	Well, that's it! All of you have detention for the rest of the week!	[]
Boys	1	0	Aawwww!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Sweet.	[]
Mr. Mackey	35	0	Welcome to detention, m'kay? Mr. Garrison told me about your little joke. It's important for you all to know why you're in detention for you to obtain the full benefits from it.	[]
Cartman	4	0	You're dead, Stan.	[]
Stan	3	0	For what, dude?	[]
Kenny	8	0	(Just face it, dude, your uncle's stupid!)	[]
Mr. Mackey	18	0	You're here because you are inferior, m'kay? You are here because you are awkward, m'kay?	[]
Cartman	19	0	Well, Stan, thanks a lot for having such a cool uncle that got us all detention for a week.	[]
Kyle	7	1	Yeah, dude, your Uncle Jimbo sucks ass!	['ass']
Mr. Mackey	3	0	Shh! M'kay?	[]
Stan	13	0	Why would he just invent a story instead of telling us the truth?	[]
Cartman	13	1	Well, let's see... Maybe 'cause he's an old, drunk hillbilly dick!	['dick']
Mr. Mackey	3	0	Shh! M'kay?	[]
Kyle	8	0	We've got to get him back, dude.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Totally.	[]
Stan	1	0	How?	[]
Kyle	15	0	Well, he screwed us by makin' something up; I say we do the same thing.	[]
Stan	5	0	Well, what do you mean?	[]
Kyle	12	0	Did you guys ever see that one Brady Bunch where the guy...	[]
Cartman	10	0	Sweet. Oh, yeah, sweet. That's super sweet. Ah-yes!	[]
Announcer	16	0	And now back to Huntin' and Killin'  with South Park's favorite hunters, Jimbo and Ned!	[]
Jimbo	35	0	Welcome, hunters. Boy, have we got a show for you today! We have just received a tape from another viewer who filmed the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka right here in South Park.	[]
Ned	1	0	Aggghhh!	[]
Jimbo	85	0	Yes, now we're about to roll the film, but remember: if you look the Mexican staring frog in the eyes, you could go catatonic. We don't know if this applies to pictures of the frog or not, but who wants to take chances? So when we roll this film, be sure to look away.  Okay, roll the film, Tom.  Is it over? Okay, it's over.  Well, there you have it. Undeniable proof that the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka exists.	[]
Jimbo	11	0	And you saw it here, on The Jimbo and Ned Show.	[]
Kyle	9	0	Dude, I can't believe they fell for it!	[]
Stan	7	1	Yeah, what a couple of dumb-asses.	['asses']
Kenny	11	0	(Yeah, it's like killing a dead pig and a turkey.)	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Kyle	8	0	Come on! We've gotta make another one!	[]
Cartman	3	1	Lying kicks ass!	['ass']
Producer	1	0	Jesus!	[]
Jesus	1	0	Yeah?	[]
Producer	24	0	We're in trouble. The Jimbo and Ned Show made up some ridiculous staring frog story and jumped another two points in the ratings!	[]
Jesus	9	0	Uh-oh, sssooo what are we supposed to do?	[]
Producer	20	0	I don't know. We'll have to continue with the changes we've made, and then go even further.	[]
Stage Hand	8	0	And we're back in five, four, three...	[]
Producer	4	0	Remember, big, big, big!	[]
Jesus	20	0	If you're just joining us, we've been listening to Michelle's incredible story of survival. Go on, Michelle.	[]
Michelle	24	0	Well, as I was saying, I tried and tried, but my overturned car just won't budge. My husband was trapped for twelve hours.	[]
Jesus	7	0	And yet, somehow, he managed to survive.	[]
Michelle	15	0	That's right. He's a very brave man, and I love him very much.	[]
Husband	4	0	I love you, too.	[]
Jesus	16	0	W-well, let's see if the audience has any questions.  Yes, uhh, you over there.	[]
Large Woman	11	0	I think she needs to kick him to the kerb, baby!	[]
Jesus	5	0	Kick who to the kerb?	[]
Large Woman	16	0	Her no-good husband! She's got to lose that zero and get herself a hero!	[]
Jesus	1	0	But--	[]
Red-Haired Woman	30	0	He wants to have his cake and eat it, too. He's got to dump that trash girlfriend.  It's all about respect. You've gotta have respect for yourself.	[]
Jesus	19	0	Uuh-I think we've somewhat missed the point here. Let's go to somebody else.  Yes, your comments.	[]
African-American	35	0	Montel, I think we're forgetting something very important in all of this. Okay, sure, he touched some children, but the man is a great singer and he has entertained us for so many years.	[]
Jesus	6	0	Wha-what are you talking about?	[]
African-American	29	0	Michael Jackson. All this baad-mouthin' and puttin' the man down. Maybe he did touch some children now and then, but come on! It's Michael Jackson! Michael Jackson!	[]
Jesus	9	0	Uhh, we'll be back right after these messages.	[]
Stan	3	0	Ready, you guys?	[]
Kyle/Cartman	1	0	Ready.	[]
Stan	2	0	Okay. Action!	[]
Cartman	18	0	Blululululululuh. I am the deadly Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka. I am very scary... And dangerous!	[]
Stan	2	0	Cut! Cartman!	[]
Cartman	1	0	What?	[]
Stan	7	0	It's supposed to be a frog!	[]
Cartman	3	0	I know that!	[]
Stan	6	0	Since when do frogs talk, Cartman?	[]
Cartman	6	0	It's a Sri Lanka frog!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Der, Cartman!	[]
Cartman	3	0	Der yourself, hippie!	[]
Kyle	11	0	Just do it again, Cartman, and don't make it talk!	[]
Stan	9	0	Okay. Here we go. Ready? Are you ready, Cartman?	[]
Cartman	5	0	I'm ready, Steven Spielberg!	[]
Stan	1	0	Action!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Blulululuh. Screw you guys.	[]
Cartman	12	0	Well, why do I have to dress up like an old lady?	[]
Kyle	9	1	'Cause old ladies are fat and you are, too!	['fat']
Cartman	2	1	Ee-goddammit!	['goddammit']
Stan	16	0	Come on, Cartman, the way we're filming this, nobody will even know it's you.	[]
Cartman	3	0	They better not!	[]
Stan	30	0	Okay, when I yell action, you start to walk this way,  then Kenny's going to pull the plastic frog in front of you, and you have to be scared.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Scared of a plastic frog?	[]
Stan	33	0	It's acting, Cartman. You have to pretend you're really scared, then the Mexican staring frog will look you in the eyes, then you fall down, like you're dead, okay? Ready?	[]
Cartman	4	0	Man, this is stupid.	[]
Stan	4	0	Good. A-and action!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Eee-ee-ee-ee!	[]
Jimbo	78	0	Well, it appears as though a lot of you skeptics thought that the film we showed of the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka was a fake. That you say it didn't harm anybody. Well, it just so happens that we just received another film from another anonymous viewer.  Roll it!  There you go! Proof that not only is this frog real, but it is doing harm to the people of South Park as we speak!	[]
Ned	4	1	Mmmm-damn that frog.	['damn']
Jimbo	12	0	Well, that does it! All this week, Ned and I will be--	[]
Jimbo	24	0	--risking life and limb as we go on location to hunt the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka. Join us, won't ya?	[]
Producer	20	1	Ooh, no, no, no, no!  This is the biggest publicity stunt I've ever seen! Damn, those hunters are clever!	['damn']
Jesus	2	0	Uhhh, clever?	[]
Producer	19	1	It's genius, it really is. Hell, I even want to watch them hunt the Mexican staring frog. Unless...	['hell']
Jesus	2	0	Unless what?	[]
Producer	46	0	Unless we can prove to the world that the whole thing is a sham. If we prove that the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka is just something..made up by Jimbo and Ned, we can have them taken off the air. Perhaps even killed!	[]
Jesus	15	0	Look, why don't we just stick to our own show? People will watch again.	[]
Producer	28	0	Oh, J. You are so omnipotent, and yet so naive. We'll launch a full investigation, and in the meantime, we can cash in on the video tapes.	[]
Jesus	3	0	What video tapes?	[]
Jesus	9	0	Yea, children. I am the way and the light...	[]
Announcer	49	0	You've seen Jesus and Pals. Now you've got to get the video! Jesus and Pals: Too Hot for TV!  Things get a little out of control!  You won't believe your eyes!  Order now, only $19.95!  Remember, this is stuff you can't see on TV!	[]
Jimbo	2	0	Anonymous tip?	[]
Tom	27	0	Yeah, it was left on our answering machine. All it said was that they saw the Mexican staring frog just south of Stark's Pond this morning.	[]
Jimbo	14	0	Hey, Ned. Remember that time when we got the anonymous tip back in 'Nam?	[]
Tom	8	0	You were in 'Nam? Where were you stationed?	[]
Ned	3	0	Mmm-Da Nang.	[]
Cameraman	4	0	With the log ride?	[]
Jimbo	1	0	Yep.	[]
Tom	55	1	Man, I was in Tet. We had a bad-ass roller coaster, but... all we ever wanted was a log ride. We waited and we waited, but... they never built us one. I think..Danforth wanted the log ride more than anybody, but he... he had to settle with that lame dinosaur water adventure ride.	['ass']
Jimbo	6	1	That war was hell on everybody.	['hell']
Producer	21	0	Good. Okay. Okay, bye! Good news, everybody. This week's ratings are through the roof! We're up to twenty people!	[]
Jimbo	6	0	Wow! Do we got more money?	[]
Producer	21	0	No, but I do. We're now the highest-rated show on Mountain Cable Access! God bless the Mexican staring frog!	[]
Kyle	7	0	Dude, they're gonna look so stupid.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Dude, totally.	[]
Stan	8	0	They deserve it for lying to us, dude.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Revenge is so very, very sweet.	[]
Stan	6	0	They're here! Hurry and hide!	[]
Jimbo	3	0	Let's hunt!	[]
Producer	16	0	We'll start with a two-shot of you and Ned getting your equipment together and--	[]
Ned	3	0	Mm-Jimbo, look!	[]
Jimbo	3	0	Hit the deck!	[]
Producer	3	0	What is it?	[]
Jimbo	19	0	It's him! The Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka. He's right over there on that rock.	[]
Producer	2	0	He is?	[]
Jimbo	29	1	Dumb-ass! You've got to keep your eyes away from him!  Stay down. Ned, you take flight position; I'll try and keep it turned away from you.	['ass']
Ned	3	0	Mm-roger that.	[]
Jimbo	84	0	Hello, fellow hunters. Have we got a show for you today.  The Mexican staring frog is sunning itself on a rock directly behind us.  We've got to take the frog by surprise. I'm gonna create a diversion using this incendiary device  while Ned will ambush him from the rear.  Now, Ned! He's not looking!  Quick, Ned, hit him with the shotgun! Now, Ned!  Ned. Ne-ed?  Oh, no!  Come on, Ned, buddy, snap out of it!  Come back to me, buddy.	[]
Producer	4	0	You getting all this?	[]
Jimbo	24	1	Hold onto your butts.  Take that, you demon frog!  Ned, Ned? Can you hear me?  Quick! Somebody, call an ambulance! This man is catatonic!	['butts']
Producer	6	0	Get the Flight for Life helicopter!	[]
Stan	3	1	Holy crap, dude.	['crap']
Jimbo	52	0	...but Ponyboy was beat up pretty bad. He kept saying, 'stay gold.'  Aw, Ned. If you can hear me, y-you've got to snap out of it, 'cause if you don't, uh-I'll never forgive myself.  Aw, Stanley, he's gone! My only friend in the world is gone!	[]
Stan	10	0	Dude, he's okay. That frog wasn't even real!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Look!	[]
Jimbo	13	1	Aghh! What the hell are you doing? I almost looked right at it!	['hell']
Stan	14	0	Dude, it's just a plastic frog; it's not real. Check it out!	[]
Jimbo	1	0	What..?	[]
Stan	9	0	We shot all those videos and sent them in.	[]
Kyle	16	0	Yeah, we made the whole thing up. It was all just a really, really funny joke!	[]
Jimbo	5	0	You sent in those videos?!	[]
Producer	5	0	Oh, this is not good.	[]
Jimbo	16	0	My best friend is a vegetable, and I'm gonna be the laughingstock of South Park!	[]
Kyle	15	0	Aw, come on. Ned's faking it. That frog was just a piece of plastic!	[]
Stan	6	0	Yeah. Come on, Ned. Quit fakin'.	[]
Jimbo	28	0	You boys don't understand. Ned was so freaked out by the idea of the Mexican staring frog that he must have sent himself into a deep coma.	[]
Jesus' Producer	14	0	It's a psychosomatic response.  I couldn't help overhearing your conversation just now.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Who are you?	[]
Jesus' Producer	27	0	I produce a little TV show called Jesus and Pals, you might have heard of it. Your story is amazing; full of jealousy, duplicity, backstabbing and bitterness.	[]
Jimbo	2	0	Uhhhh... Thanks?	[]
Jesus' Producer	15	0	How would you like to share your remarkable story with us on tomorrow's show?	[]
Jesus	18	0	We're back with Jimbo and his nephew, Stan. These kids can't stop lying, can't they?	[]
Jimbo	54	0	That's right, Jesus. No respect for their elders. As some of you may know, I host a local show on hunting.  Thanks. We've been hunting the Mexican staring frog for a week based on some video footage we received from a viewer. Well, it turns out that these kids faked the footage!	[]
Jesus	4	0	Is that true, Stan?	[]
Stan	13	0	It was just a joke; we didn't think it would hurt anybody.	[]
Jesus	12	0	Uhh, we'll find out more about this debauchery when we return.	[]
Cameraman	5	0	A-and we're out.	[]
Producer	13	0	You're corpses out here! We need a lot more action from everybody!	[]
Jimbo	2	0	Like what?	[]
Producer	14	1	Like, go ahead and tell how your nephew Stan takes drugs and worships Satan.	['drugs']
Jimbo	3	0	Satan. Got it.	[]
Stan	12	1	Whoa, I don't take drugs and worship Satan! That's lying!	['drugs']
Jimbo	11	0	Give you a taste of your own medicine, you little fibber!	[]
Producer	25	0	And you kids! I didn't bring you on this show to be boring. Somebody get pissed off and throw a chair at Ned here.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Dibs!	[]
Producer	15	0	Remember, you all start to fight after the chair is thrown. That's your cue.	[]
Jimbo	1	0	Roger.	[]
Jesus	14	0	Welcome back to Jesus and Pals. Jimbo, why do you think little Stanley lies?	[]
Jimbo	14	1	I'll tell you why. Because he's on drugs and worships the devil!	['drugs']
Audience	3	0	Jeesus! Jeesus! Jeesus!	[]
Jesus	13	0	Wow. Now, Stanley, it sound like your uncle is really worried about you.	[]
Stan	9	1	Well, I only..did it 'cause... he..molested me.	['molested']
Jimbo	6	1	Why, you little piece of crap!	['crap']
Stan	5	1	You big piece of crap!	['crap']
Cartman	12	0	That's it! Now I'm all pissed off!  Take that, hippie!	[]
Jimbo	1	0	Hey!	[]
Audience	2	0	Jeesus! Jeesus!	[]
Jesus	6	0	O-okay, okay, that's enough.	[]
Woman	9	2	Take that, you asshole!  What the fuck was that?	['asshole', 'fuck']
Jesus	7	0	Uh, let's watch the language, people.	[]
Jimbo	5	1	Bring it on, you bitch!	['bitch']

Stan	42	0	W-we only did it because Jimbo lied to us first. We had this report on the Vietnam War for school, and we interviewed Jimbo about it and he made up all this stuff about Vietnam, and he got us in trouble.	[]
Jimbo	12	0	Hey, now. Everything I told you boys about the war actually happened.	[]
Stan	19	0	Mr. Garrison said that there was no way that you could have defeated the entire Vietcong Army by yourself.	[]
Jesus	4	0	The entire Vietcong Army?	[]
Jimbo	16	0	I uh... Well, okay, I might have embellished the truth a little, but that's different.	[]
Jesus	2	0	Is it?	[]
Jimbo	11	0	Well, sure. I mean, eh...  Well, no uh, I guess not.	[]
Jesus	16	1	And as for you, Stan uh, I think you need to kick your drug habit and--	['drug']
Stan	12	1	Wait a second, I don't take drugs! That was a lie!	['drugs']
Jesus	5	0	Wait. Jimbo made that up?	[]
Stan	13	1	No, your producer did.  She made Jimbo tell everybody that I did drugs.	['drugs']
Jesus	1	0	What?	[]
Stan	20	0	During the break. Your producer came over, and told Jimbo what to say about me. She told him to lie!	[]
Jimbo	11	0	It's true, she did. Hu-I'm such a tool.	[]
Jesus	2	0	Oh, really?	[]
Kyle	11	0	Yeah! Then she told us to throw a chair at Ned!	[]
Cartman	13	0	Yeah. I didn't wanna do it, Jesus. They made me do that.	[]
Man in Brown Shirt	9	0	Screw this show. I thought this was all real.	[]

African-American	17	0	Don't feel too bad, Montel. We all want to touch children sometimes; it's only natural.	[]
Jimbo	23	0	I'm sorry, Stan. I was just trying to tell a good story. I never meant for you boys to get in trouble.	[]
Stan	21	0	W-we're sorry, too, Uncle Jimbo. We're sorry for making you look stupid in front of the whole world.	[]
Kyle	11	0	Yeah. And we're sorry for turning Ned into a vegetable.	[]
Jimbo	30	1	Aw, he'll be fine. I'll just take him home and show him some good hard-core porn, he'll snap right out of it. Won't you, Ned?	['porn']
Jesus	32	0	I want to apologize to all of you for what happened in there. In our competition for ratings we lost sight of why we got into show business in the first place.	[]
Jimbo	4	1	Yeah. Titties and beer.	['titties']
Jesus	34	0	Actually, I was referring more to the pursuit of truth, but-Well, anyway, I can't wait to get back to my old show without all the glitz and the ratings and producers and--	[]
Kyle	7	0	Wait a sec. Where is your producer?	[]
Jesus	4	0	I sent her away.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Sent her away where?	[]
Producer	6	0	What is this? What's happening?!	[]
