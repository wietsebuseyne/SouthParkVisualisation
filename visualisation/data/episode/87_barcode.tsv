Priest Maxi	48	0	Parents, it's that time of year again when the bishops and priests from around the country are organizing the Young Men's Catholic Retreat. This year, we're taking the boys on a weekend boat trip to discuss Jesus's role as the Navigator of our lives.	[]
Stan	4	0	That sounds pretty fun.	[]
Randy	4	0	A Catholic boat trip?	[]
Singer	30	0	The Catholic Boat's gonna be headin' on out today. The Catholic Boat. Time to throw all of your cares away. Get some hot Christian action; it'll make you-	[]
Randy	6	0	Waaah! Waaah!  Uyah  ahem. 'Scuse me.	[]
Randy	24	0	Look, I just don't think it's the best idea to let our boys to go on a c-cruise with the priests.	[]
Richard	7	0	We can let them go, can we?	[]
Linda	8	0	There's no way my son's going.	[]
Stan	5	0	What are they talking about?	[]
Cartman	4	0	I don't know.	[]
Tweek	5	0	Maybe they wanna kill us.	[]
Randy	22	0	With everything that's been in the news, I think it's best to keep our kids... far away from the priests.	[]
Stuart	24	1	Now, come on, everybody, just because a few priests in the country have been corrupted doesn't mean that all priests are child molesters.	['molesters']
Richard	33	0	Well, sure, that's easy for you to say; your son's dead. But those of us with alive children need to be sure that Father Maxi's on the up-and-up.	[]
Sharon	26	0	I've heard about other towns bringing in counselors that know how to find things out from kids without really telling them what's going on.	[]
Randy	4	0	It couldn't hurt.	[]
Richard	9	0	Uh, Sh-sh. Here he comes, here he comes.	[]
Priest Maxi	4	0	Uh... Good-bye, everyone.	[]
All	3	0	Good-bye, Father.	[]
Stephen	17	0	Alright, then, it's settled. Tomorrow we'll find an outside counselor and... find out the truth.	[]
Counselor	20	0	Hi boys. My name is Ms. Gorache and I need to ask you a few questions about your priest, okaaay?	[]
Boys	1	0	Okay.	[]
Counselor	11	0	Okay. Would you say that Father Maxi is... nice? Or mean?	[]
Boys	1	0	Nice.	[]
Stan	2	0	Um, cool.	[]
Counselor	10	0	Okaaay, what words would you use to describe your priest?	[]
Butters	1	0	Compassionate.	[]
Counselor	16	1	Okay. And did Father Maxi, at any time, ever try to put something in your butt?	['butt']
Cartman	4	1	Ih... in our... butt?	['butt']
Counselor	20	1	You don't need to be ashamed or embarrassed. Just, did he ever try to put anything in your butt?	['butt']
Stan	3	0	...Like ...money? What?	[]
Butters	5	0	You mean, like a goldfish?	[]
Counselor	16	1	No, no. Did he ever try to put anything that belonged to him in your butt?	['butt']
Boys	1	0	No.	[]
Thomas	18	1	This is ridiculous, havin' to sit out here waitin' to find out if our priest molested our kids.	['molested']
Man	7	0	Yeah, what has Catholicism come to anyway?	[]
Randy	30	0	You know, I think we've just had it with the Church. All the horrible things they've done to kids, I... I think I'm gonna become an atheist!	[]
Richard	12	0	That's a good idea. I'm gonna be an atheist too.	[]
Linda	5	0	Let's all be atheists!	[]
All	3	0	Yeah, yeah, alright.	[]
Man	17	1	If there was a god, why would he let our kids be molested in the first place?	['molested']
Stephen	6	0	Yeah, let's kill God, yeah!	[]
Randy	9	0	Well uh, let's, let's just be atheists.	[]
Stephen	2	0	...Same thing.	[]
Randy	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Stan	11	1	What would the priest ...possibly want to put in our butts?	['butts']
Cartman	2	0	Maybe... No.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Hey dudes.	[]
"Stan, Cartman"	1	0	Hey.	[]
Tweek	1	0	Arr!	[]
Kyle	5	0	What are you guys doin'?	[]
Stan	22	1	We had to go meet with this counselor lady, and she asked us if the priest every put anything in our butts.	['butts']
Kyle	3	1	In your butts?	['butts']
Cartman	7	1	Yeah, isn't that the damnedest thing?	['damnedest']
Kyle	8	1	Why would he put anything in your butts?	['butts']
Stan	15	0	We don't know. We're- that's what we're tryin' to figure out.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Hm.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Hm.	[]
Chef	3	0	Hello there, children!	[]
Stan	11	1	Chef! What would a priest want to stick up my butt?	['butt']
Chef	2	0	Good-bah!	[]
Tweek	14	0	Rrrh. Nobody is going to tell us. This is going to drive me insane!	[]
Kyle	10	0	Calm down, Tweek. There has to be a rational explanation.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Aw, dude, I think I might have it.	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Cartman	21	2	It makes perfect sense. Okay, w-work with me on this: if you eat food, you crap out your butt, right?	['crap', 'butt']
Kyle	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Cartman	37	4	Alright, now keep working with me here, it's getting a little complicated. If you eat food and crap out your butt, then maybe, if you stuck food in your butt, you crap out your mouth.  Hm?	['crap', 'butt', 'butt', 'crap']
Kyle	12	0	Cartman, that's the dumbest thing you've ever said - this week!	[]
Cartman	33	2	What, that's not dumb. Think about it: food goes in the mouth, comes out the butt. Food goes in the butt, comes out the mouth. That's not dumb, that's genius.	['butt', 'butt']
Kyle	4	0	It wouldn't work!	[]
Cartman	5	0	Have you ever tried it?	[]
Kyle	9	0	I don't need to. It wouldn't work.	[]
Cartman	8	0	I bet you twenty bucks it'll work!	[]
Kyle	5	1	You're on, fat boy!	['fat']
Cartman	5	1	Okay, let's go, Jew!	['jew']
Parents	8	0	Yeah, yeah! Down with God! Down with God!	[]
Randy	6	0	Stan, you're an atheist now!	[]
Richard	3	0	You too, Tweek!	[]
Parents	8	0	Yeah, yeah! Down with God! Down with God!	[]
Tweek	4	0	I'm a what??	[]
Priest Maxi	9	0	Fathers, I want to thank you all for coming.	[]
Priest 1	23	0	No, thank you for finally organizing an all-priests meeting, Father Maxi. I think we all agree something has to be done, quickly.	[]
Elderly Priest	26	0	Well, I don't know how it's been for all of you, but attendance at my church in Fort Rawlins is down sixty-three percent!	[]
Priest 2	7	0	I'm down almost seventy in Greenleaf.	[]
Priest Maxi	20	0	Uh-yes, uh, I'm afraid if things keep going the way they are, we could lose our entire religion.	[]
Elderly Priest	12	0	Yes, we've gotta stop these boys from goin' to the public!	[]
Fat Priest	9	0	They've gotta know to keep their mouths shut!	[]
Other priests	3	0	That right, yeah.	[]
Priest Maxi	8	0	Right, and so... wa- wait a minute. What?	[]
Priest 1	29	1	Yes, but we've got to find out why these children are suddenly finding it necessary to report that they're being molested. Stop the problem at its source.	['molested']
Priest 2	3	0	Yes, but how?	[]
Priest 3	5	0	Something has to be done.	[]
Priest 4	6	0	We've got to stop this-	[]
Priest Maxi	20	1	Whoa, whoa, hold on a second! The problem is that children are being molested, not that they're reporting it!	['molested']
Elderly Priest	4	0	How do you mean?	[]
Priest Maxi	41	1	Well, I mean, obviously, what we need to put a stop to is all the sexual misconduct that is allowed to take place in our churches, and not just tell the children not to tell anybody about it. I mean, right?	['sexual']
Priest 1	11	1	Well did any of the children you've molested come forward?	['molested']
Priest Maxi	1	0	No.	[]
Priest 1	4	0	Well, that's good.	[]
Priest Maxi	14	1	No, I mean! I've never molested any of the children in my church!	['molested']
Elderly Priest	15	0	Hih-it's okay, Father Maxi. We're all priests here; the doors are closed.	[]
Priest Maxi	37	0	Oh for the love of God! Are you all saying that you've engaged in inappropriate relations with your altar boys? We are here to bring the light of God, not harm the innocent!  I'm serious!	[]
Priest 2	16	1	Father, uh, having sex with boys is part of the Catholic priest's way of life.	['sex']
Other priests	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Priest Maxi	24	0	Dear God. This problem is much more severe than I could have possibly imagined. I have to go to the Vatican and get help.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Well, Cartman?	[]
Cartman	7	1	Hold on!  God, let a man crap!	['crap']
Craig	4	0	What's going on?	[]
Stan	16	2	Cartman shoved food up his ass and now he's tryin' to crap out his mouth.	['ass', 'crap']
Craig	1	0	Oh.	[]
Kyle	7	1	Well, go on, smartass, and do it!	['smartass']
Cartman	10	0	I'm doin' it already!! God, give me a minute!	[]
Stan	5	0	You've had five, dude!	[]
Cartman	14	0	I can't-, I can't do it with you guys watching. Turn around.	[]
Kyle	18	2	No! Because you'll just crap out your butt and then say it came out of your mouth!	['crap', 'butt']
Cartman	20	1	Ugh! Do you really think I'd be that deceitful, you guys?!  Ugh, goddammit you guys, this is so seriously.	['goddammit']
Kyle	6	1	Get the fuck out of here!	['fuck']
Cartman	22	3	Yes!! Yes, I DID IT!! I crapped out my mouth!  I crapped out my mo-outh!  You owe me twenty bucks, dickface!	['crapped', 'crapped', 'dickface']
Priest Maxi	13	0	Well, there you go. Um, grazie.  Wow, I'm actually here. Vatican City!	[]
Italian Cardinal	16	0	Your Holiness, this is Father Maxi from America. He has brought this all to our attention.	[]
Father Maxi	2	0	Your Holiness.	[]
Italian Cardinal	3	0	Adoramus te, Christe.	[]
Other Cardinals	2	0	Et dominus...	[]
Italian Cardinal	57	2	Cardinals, bishops, and priests, an American priest by the name of-a Maxi has brought to our attention the most troubling of news. All over his-a country there are reports of children being molested by men of the Church. If things continue this way, we'll never be able to have sex with young boys again!	['molested', 'sex']
Father Maxi	5	0	That's right-wait. What?	[]
French Cardinal	17	0	In France as well we are finding it harder and harder to... make love to our boys.	[]
Moroccan Cardinal	23	0	In Morocco they have arrested five of my priests. It's only a matter of time before they get the rest of us.	[]
Italian Cardinal	12	0	Father Maxi, what do you suggest we do to not get caught.	[]
Father Maxi	17	1	Not get caught? NO!! I, I think what we should do is not have sex with boys!	['sex']
Italian Cardinal	19	1	It is not written anywhere in the Holy Document of Vatican Law that sex with-a boys is wrong..	['sex']
Father Maxi	12	0	Well, maybe we need to change the Holy Document of Vatican Law.	[]
British Cardinal	27	0	Speaking on behalf of the British Catholics, it is obvious that the priest doesn't realize that the Holy Document of Vatican Law can not be changed!	[]
The Clergy	6	0	Yeah! It cannot be changed! Yeah!	[]
Gelgamek Cardinal	21	0	Yes, and speaking on behalf of the Gelgamek Catholics, I believe we should move on to other solutions to this problem.	[]
Priest Maxi	1	0	Gelgameks?	[]
Cartman	10	0	Kyle, could you help me out? I need some advice.	[]
Kyle	1	0	What?	[]
Cartman	42	0	It's just that... I can't decide what to buy with your twenty dollars!  I was thinking of getting this mega-man racer for $19.95, or I could get two Broncos trading packs for ten apiece. And then I thought-	[]
Randy	16	0	Oh boy, now that we're atheists we don't have to pray for our food.	[]
Sharon	16	0	That's right, everyone just dig in.  So, kids,anything happen with your whole Sunday off?	[]
Stan	13	2	Uh, Cartman shoved his lunch up his ass and crapped out his mouth.	['ass', 'crapped']
Sharon	1	0	Stanley!	[]
Stan	3	0	What? He did.	[]
Randy	8	0	Noho, it doesn't work that way, son.	[]
Stan	3	0	Yeah it does.	[]
Randy	4	0	No it doesn't.	[]
Stan	3	0	Yeah. It does.	[]
Randy	4	0	Honey! Honey, come quick!	[]
Priest Maxi	27	0	Look, people! I'm just trying to say that if we don't change the Holy Document of Vatican Law, then we might lose everyone to atheism!	[]
French Cardinal	9	0	What exactly do you suggest we change, Father Maxi.	[]
Priest Maxi	7	1	Well, for one, no sex with boys.	['sex']
Another Cardinal	24	1	The Holy Document of Vatican Law states that a priest, bishop, or cardinal cannot get married, so where are we to get our sex?	['sex']
Priest Maxi	31	1	Uh well then, perhaps we could change the Holy Document of Vatican Law to say that... it's okay for a priest or bishop or cardinal to have sex... with women.	['sex']
French Cardinal	1	0	Women?	[]
Gelgamek Cardinal	23	2	The Gelgamek vagina is three feet wide and filled with razor-sharp teeth. Do you really expect us to have sex with them?!	['vagina', 'sex']
Priest Maxi	17	0	Wuh- okay, m-maybe we just need to forget about the Gelgameks for a second and focus-	[]
Gelgamek Cardinal	6	0	What's that about the Gelgameks?!	[]
Priest Maxi	33	0	I'm just saying, what works on planet Gelgamek isn't necessarily goin' ta work for the rest of us here, on Earth. You see? That's the problem we're having here.	[]
Italian Cardinal	11	0	But-a the Holy Document of Vatican Law cannot be changed!	[]
Priest Maxi	2	0	Why not?!	[]
Another Cardinal	8	0	Because we don't know where it is.	[]
Italian Cardinal	33	0	You see, Father, the Holy Document of Vatican Law has been hidden away deep in the Catacombs of-a St. Peter's below us. Hidden away so that it can never be changed.	[]
Priest Maxi	11	0	But if we locate it we can make changes to it?	[]
A bishop	27	0	HA! Good luck, father! The document is guarded by water lizards, rattlesnakes and sand traps! The fools who have tried before to recover it met their deaths!	[]
Priest Maxi	9	0	Well we have to try. Our religion is dying!	[]
Cartman	5	0	You guys! You guys! Look!	[]
Tweek	1	0	Harrr!	[]
Cartman	19	0	I went down to the bank and got Kyle's twenty-dollar bill turned into twenty single-dollar bills.	[]
Stan	1	0	So?	[]
Cartman	16	0	So? So now I can do this!  Yeess! Yeess, Kyle's money! Mmmm, Kyle's money!	[]
Kyle	4	1	Go fuck yourself, Cartman!	['fuck']
Cartman	9	0	Oh, it feels so good on my skin! Mmmm.	[]
Kyle	10	2	Get up, fat boy! I'm gonna kick your ass!	['fat', 'ass']
Cartman	17	0	Gee Kyle, don't be a sore loser. It's over, okay? I won. Let it go.	[]
Kyle	16	1	So you crapped out of your mouth! Good for you! It's still stupid and immature!	['crapped']
Stan	2	0	Dude, look.	[]
News Anchor	44	2	Our top story tonight, the age-old question has been answered: if I put food up my ass, will I crap out my mouth? All over the country, people are discovering that, yes, in fact, you will.  The surgeon-general had this to say:	['ass', 'crap']
Surgeon-General	77	1	And the uh immediate research shows that the act is not only amusing, but in fact much healthier for out bodies than the old way of eating.  You see, food entering through the anus has the benefit of being broken down on its way to the stomach rather than afterward. And therefore I believe that interorectogestion would actually put a stop to high cholesterol and most kinds of stomach cancers. And I base that on absolutely nothing.	['anus']
News Anchor	14	0	The Surgeon-General's response has made Americans change their eating habits almost instantly.	[]
Cartman	6	0	That's stupid and immature, Cartman!	[]
Kyle	22	1	It is stupid and immature! So you got people to crap out of their mouths! What do you want, a feakin' medal?!	['crap']
News Anchor	26	0	The Mayor of South Park has announced that for first discovering this healthy way of eating, young citizen   Eric Cartman will be given... a freaking medal.	[]
Kyle	1	0	HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!	[]
Announcer	8	0	Now, with more on Martha Stewart's Living .	[]
Martha Stewart	98	3	In the past few days we've all heard of the healthy benefits of interorectogestion, and so making food that can be inserted into the ass is essential.  Now, everyone knows that some foods are simple to shove up the ass - puddings, soups, raisins... this is a nice raisin pudding right here - but we can also still eat our favorite foods. What we're gonna do today is prepare a Thanksgiving turkey for interorecto.  Now, the key to shoving a turkey up your ass is first wrapping it in string, keeping the pointy wings neatly at the side.	['ass', 'ass', 'ass']
FBI agent	6	0	Ms. Stewart, we have some questions.	[]
Martha Stewart	96	0	Not right now, I just wanna focus on my turkey,  right now.  Now, we're going to baste the turkey with lubricating gel rather than with juice - this'll help smooth the insertion later on. We still bake at four hundred degrees for twenty minutes a pound.  When it's done we'll get something like this.  So now we're ready to go. Looks delicious. Let's try it out.  Aaaaa-... Yeah, get it up there. Yeah. AAAA. Yeeaahhhh.  Phew. And that is how you eat a turkey.  We'll be right back with more.	[]
Old Monk	1	0	Beoo!	[]
Priest Maxi	12	0	Ahh, hello. Uh- My name is Father Maxi, from the United States.	[]
Old Monk	5	0	What do you seek, Father?	[]
Priest Maxi	20	0	I... I'm trying to find the Holy Document of Vatican Law. ...So that we can make revisions to it.	[]
Old Monk	26	0	That Gospel...  lies somewhere beyond this door.  But... many troubles await thee inside! Only he whose heart truly belongs to the Lord shalla make it through.	[]
Priest Maxi	18	0	I have to try. Our religion is in trouble, and... and that scroll may be our only hope!	[]
Old Monk	26	0	Then, prepare yourself. The time of trials begins.  Adoramus te, Christe!  I wish you luck, Father. Use all the strength, agility, and faith that you have.	[]
Priest Maxi	45	0	Very well. Here we go.  Hmmm, there's a ladder up here.  Oh my God, a rattlesnake!  A way back up!  I've made it! Praise be to God! He hath shown me the way!  This must be it. The Holy Document of Vatican Law.	[]
Randy	35	0	Well, Sharon and I are havin' a great time bein' atheist. I for one can't believe I used to live my life by what a very old and very fictional book used to say.	[]
Linda	25	0	Well it's true. I mean, what do a bunch of stories about people in robes slaughtering goats have to do with today's world?	[]
Richard	7	0	Atheism has definitely made our lives better.	[]
Sharon	8	0	I made some quesadillas, if anybody wants some.	[]
All	1	0	Ooohh.	[]
Sharon	13	0	And if anybody needs to potty, there's a potty basket right here.	[]
Richard	3	0	Oh thanks, Sharon.	[]
Man	59	0	You know, for Martha and I, we're, we're worried we might have a hard time raising our son atheist. I mean-  whoa, thank you -I mean,  it could end up being very difficult raising an atheist child in such a Christian society.  I feel that everywhere my poor son goes he's being persecuted for his beliefs.	[]
Richard	53	0	That's true. If I'm gonna raise my son to be atheist, I don't want him saying under God every day at school. That could really damage him. Under God should be taken out of the- uh, 'scuse me.  Moowwaaagh.  Under God should be taken out of the Pledge of Allegiance.	[]
Randy	44	0	That's right, I agree.  And it should be taken off of money as well.  The religious right in this country is trying to force our children to believe what they bel-  Bwwaaaagh  And we can't let the religious right corrupt our kids.	[]
All	6	0	That's right, that's right.	[]
Italian Cardinal	18	0	Cardinals, bishops and priests! Father Maxi has returned! And he has the Holy Document of-a Vatican Law!	[]
British Cardinal	9	0	How did he make it past the water lizards?	[]
Priest Maxi	29	1	Yes, I have returned with the Holy Document of Vatican Law, so can we PLEASE, change  it now to say, It's NOT okay to have sex with boys?	['sex']
Italian Cardinal	21	0	Wait wait-a, the pope-a wants-a to say something.  The pope-a says we shall ask the highest source.	[]
Priest Maxi	2	0	Oh my.	[]
Italian Cardinal	8	0	The holy one!  Behold the great Queen Spider!	[]
The Clergy	3	0	Hail Queen Spider!	[]
Priest Maxi	2	0	Queen spider?	[]
Italian Cardinal	9	0	O great Queen Spider, we seek a-your guidance.	[]
Queen Spider	6	0	What do you ask of me?	[]
British Cardinal	12	0	Great Queen Spider, we seek to change one of the Vatican rules.	[]
Queen Spider	10	0	The Vatican rules cannot be changed. So saith the Spider	[]
Italian Cardinal	10	0	Go on, Priest Maxi. See if you can convince her.	[]
Priest Maxi	44	0	Alright, that does it!!! I've had enough!!! You people have completely lost touch with the outside world! You sit in this big room with your Gelgameks and your Queen Spider, and none of it applies to what being a Catholic is all about!!	[]
A bishop	9	0	But the Holy Document of Vatican Law states that-	[]
Priest Maxi	9	1	To hell with the Holy Document of Vatican Law!!	['hell']
Cartman	22	0	You guys, you guys!  I took Kyle's twenty dollars down to the bank again, and I got it changed into quarters!	[]
Kyle	1	0	So?	[]
Cartman	21	0	So now I can dump them into this little pool and swim in them all day long!  Yeessss. Kyle's monneey.	[]
Kyle	9	0	Cartman, there's something I need to tell you.	[]
Cartman	6	0	O-hoo, what's that, Kyle?	[]
Kyle	7	0	You were totally, one hundred percent right.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Heh...  what?	[]
Kyle	55	1	You won the bet. You were totally accurate about being able to crap out your mouth, and I've just been frustrated because I didn't think of it first. I want you to enjoy that money because... you really impressed me with your insight and... I'm... proud to have you as a friend.	['crap']
Cartman	6	1	You sonofabitch, Kyle!! I hate you!!	['sonofabitch']
A man	5	0	Yeah, the pope is gone!	[]
Randy	8	0	Great news, Stan! The Vatican is burning down!	[]
Linda	5	0	Score one for us atheists	[]
Richard	10	0	Come on, Tweek! We're gonna watch it on TV!	[]
Italian Cardinal	5	0	Gone! It's all gone!	[]
British Cardinal	11	0	Well, thanks a lot, Father Maxi. You've killed our religion.	[]
Priest Maxi	132	1	No I didn't! All that's dead are your stupid laws and rules!  You've forgotten what being a Catholic is all about.  This... book. You see, these are just stories.  Stories that are meant to help people in the right direction. Love your neighbor. Be a good person.  That's it! And when you start turning the stories into literal translations of hierarchies and power, well... Well, you end up with this.  People are losing faith because they don't see how what you've turned the religion into applies to them! They've lost touch with any idea of any kind of religion, and when they have no mythology to try and live their lives by, well, they just start spewing a bunch of crap out of their mouths!	['crap']
Richard	5	0	...What was that last bit?	[]
Priest Maxi	37	0	Look, I, I'm proud to be a Catholic. But I'm a Catholic in the real world. In today's world! It's time for you all to do that, too. It is time... for change.	[]
Randy	44	1	He's right, Sharon. We don't have to believe every word of the Bible. They're just stories to help us to live by. We shouldn't toss away the lessons of the Bible just because some assholes in Italy screwed it up.	['assholes']
Sharon	12	1	O Randy, I don't wanna put food up my butt anymore.	['butt']
Randy	9	0	Gang, I think maybe we, owe God an apology.	[]
Stan	12	0	Does this mean we have to go to church on Sundays again?	[]
Randy	12	0	No. It means we get to, son. It means... we get to.	[]
