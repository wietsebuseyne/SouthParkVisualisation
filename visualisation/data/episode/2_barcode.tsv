Wendy	9	0	My paper was on the suffering of bottlenose dolphins.	[]

Mayor	18	0	Yes! If I can show just how much I turned South Park around, I could become a Senator.	[]
Aide 2	5	0	Maybe even a State Senator.	[]
Aide 1	7	0	Mayor, we should decorate the town square.	[]
Aide 2	22	0	Then we should have the chef of the school cafeteria sing a song, and play up the ethnic diversity of our town.	[]
Mayor	11	0	That's right, he's a black guy isn't he?	[]
Aide 1	6	0	Black as the night itself Mayor.	[]

Stan	5	0	Yeah, that'd be cool.	[]
Kenny	6	1	(How big's your penis, Chef?)	['penis']
Chef	9	0	Well, three times bigger than Frank Gifford's, anyway.	[]
Mr. Garrison	23	0	Oh, I can't even concentrate on grading papers with all this excitement.  Why are you looking at me like that Mr. Hat?	[]
Mr. Hat	15	0	Have you forgotten about all the pain and suffering that Kathie Lee Gifford caused you?	[]

Mr. Garrison	8	0	Do you have a feather on your head?	[]
Clyde	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Mr. Garrison	5	0	Then you're an Indian.	[]
Clyde	1	0	Oh.	[]
Mr. Garrison	6	0	Okay Bebe, this is your line.	[]
Bebe	25	0	This is the story of South Park. It begins over a hundred years ago. When the noble and hardy Ute Indians lived on the land.	[]
Mayor	6	0	Oh, don't they look adorable?	[]
Bebe	9	0	Then, from the east, came the great white pioneers.	[]
Mayor	3	0	Oh my God!	[]
Mr. Garrison	12	0	They did it a lot better this morning, they had more energy.	[]
Bebe	12	0	The pioneers met with the Indians, and negotiated for their fertile lands.	[]
Mayor	18	0	Mr. Garrison, we can not have our children beating each other senseless in front of Kathie Lee Gifford.	[]
Mr. Garrison	13	0	Well, what do you want? This is how it happened in those days.	[]
Stan	5	0	Take that you stupid Indian!	[]
Clyde	1	0	Dow!	[]
Mayor	16	0	Mr. Garrison, this is not appropriate. Do you actually think Kathie Lee Gifford would enjoy this?!?	[]

Jimbo	4	0	Okay, how about this?	[]
Mr. Garrison	13	0	You talkin' to me?  Hmm, no, I don't like this one either.	[]
Jimbo	9	0	Here's the same gun, with a wood finish.	[]
Mr. Garrison	23	0	You talkin' to me? I don't see anybody else around here, so you must be talkin' to me.  I'll take it!	[]
Wendy	28	0	Hello?  My essay by Eric Cartman: When I wrote the following pages, or rather the bulk of them, I lived alone in the woods on the shore of...	[]
Mr. Garrison	37	0	Well, Mr. Hat, I guess ole Kathie Lee really will be surprised when she gets here tomorrow. She beat us in the talent show all those years ago. And I think we owe her for that. Babang!	[]
Wendy	3	0	Oh my God.	[]
Townsman	5	0	Howdy Mr. Garrison, nice gun.	[]
Mr. Garrison	2	0	Thank you.	[]

Officer Barbrady	13	0	Hmmmm. You know, I think the book depository would be a good bet.	[]
Mr. Garrison	10	0	Yes, that might do quite nicely. Thank you Officer Barbrady.	[]
Officer Barbrady	12	0	No problem.  Hah! Caught you red handed. No Pictures of Kathie Lee.	[]

Cartman	16	0	This is sweet. Camera crews are setting up and I'm looking totally ripped. Beefcake. Beefcake!	[]
Kyle	18	0	I don't think they're going to be able to get all of you in frame Cartman.	[]
Wendy	7	0	You guys, we have to stop him!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Stop who?	[]
Wendy	12	0	Mr. Garrison. He's going to try to kill Kathie Lee Gifford.	[]

Wendy	5	0	He's got a gun!	[]
Cartman	21	0	You got to get over this whole jealousy thing. Eh, seriously. Just face it, I wrote a better paper than you.	[]
Wendy	25	0	It just so happens that I have your paper, and I know why you won! There's something more important right now. Let's go!	[]
Stan	16	0	Wendy, you got to prioritize. What's more important? Being on TV or some stupid assassination?	[]
Wendy	8	0	Stan, I can't do it alone. Please?	[]
Kyle	6	0	Uh oh, we're losing him.	[]
Mayor	3	0	Here she comes.	[]
Mr. Garrison	19	1	Damn, I guess I'm not the only person in America who's thought of killing Kathie Lee Gifford.	['damn']

Mayor	20	0	It is with great pride and honor that I'd like to welcome Mrs. Kathie Lee Gifford to South Park.	[]
Chef	108	0	Thank you Mr. Mayor. You know Kathie Lee, you are a very special woman. I don't mean special in a Mary Tyler Moore way. Or, or special in an Extra Value Meal at Happy Burger way. Noo nononono. I mean special. Like the song of a, a humming bird as it gets ready to find that female hummingbird and make sweet love to it all night long. Just two humming birds moaning and, and groaning and, and their bodies caress and touch each other in ecstasy. Oh, Kathie Lee, how I'd love to lay you down. And lick every inch of your body with my tongue.	[]
Mayor	1	0	What?	[]

Wendy	14	0	I know that she's hurt you. She's hurt a lot of people.	[]
Mr. Garrison	4	0	You can't know.	[]
Wendy	7	0	You should have won that talent show.	[]
Kathie Lee	21	0	It is with great honor and pride that I present the winner his trophy. Eric, would you please come up here?	[]
Cartman	8	0	Here it is, my big moment of fame.	[]
Mr. Garrison	15	0	...and then she finished it all by throwing her voice with two dummies at once.	[]
Wendy	11	0	I know that Mr. Garrison, but this isn't the answer.	[]
Mr. Garrison	8	0	It is, too late for me, young Wendy.	[]
Wendy	41	0	You see, I've learned something today. You can't win all the time. And if you don't win, you certainly can't hold it against the person who did, because that's the only way you ever really lose.	[]
Mr. Garrison	4	0	You... you're right.	[]
Wendy	1	0	Gooood.	[]
Stan	12	0	Man, did she really throw her voice with two dummies at once?	[]
Mr. Hat	4	1	The bitch must die!	['bitch']

TV Crew Director	9	0	I guess that's it, guys. Wrap it up.	[]
Cartman	12	0	Hey! Wait a minute! When do I get to be on television?	[]
TV Crew Director	9	0	Forget it kid. No Kathie Lee, no public interest.	[]
Cartman	7	0	But I won the environmental essay contest.	[]
Wendy	42	0	You don't deserve to win Cartman. And you know it.  I'm holding Cartman's award winning paper. It's actually nothing more than Walden, with Henry David Thoreau's name crossed out, and Cartman's name written in its place.	[]
Townsman 1	2	0	Who cares?	[]
Townsman 2	6	0	Yeah, Kathie Lee Gifford's gone.	[]
Stan	11	0	Wha, What about, not holding anything against the person who wins?	[]
Wendy	34	0	Well, not if it's Cartman.  Hey, where are you all going!  They don't even know what Walden is.  I bet if Walden was a sitcom you'd all know what it was.	[]
Stan	12	0	Come on Wendy, Kyle's mom will make us tuna fish sandwiches.	[]
Wendy	4	1	Ah, what the hell.	['hell']
Mayor	22	0	Nohoho nooo. Now I'll be stuck in this podunk town forever, with all these stupid hick, redneck, jobless, truck driving idiots!	[]
Aide 1	6	0	Uh, Mayor, the mic is on.	[]
Officer Barbrady	10	0	Thought you could get away with it, eh Mr. Hat?	[]
Mr. Hat	16	0	Well, I would have gotten away with it if it weren't for those meddling kids.	[]
Officer Barbrady	12	0	You're lucky that you missed Kathie Lee and nobody got hurt.	[]
Stan	12	0	We hope you can come back to school real soon Mr. Garrison.	[]
Mr. Garrison	16	0	Well children, I'd love to, but the doctor say that Mr. Hat needs more therapy.	[]
Mr. Hat	7	0	We can still get her! Let mmm--	[]
Mr. Garrison	15	0	I'm just so sorry that I ruined everyone's chances for being on TV.	[]
Kyle	9	0	Not Cartman, he gets to be on TV anyway.	[]
Mr. Garrison	3	0	Really, on what?	[]
Geraldo	43	2	Obesity, adiposity, corpulence... Whatever word you use, it represents one thing: Being a big fat ass. We have with us today, live via satellite, Eric Cartman from South Park, who is now so obese he can't even get out of his house.	['fat', 'ass']
Cartman	9	0	When is this going to be on the air?	[]
Geraldo	12	0	Is there anything you'd like to say to people out there?	[]
Cartman	14	0	Follow your dreams, you can reach your goals; I'm living proof. Beefcake. Beefcake!	[]
Chef	12	1	He needs to run his ass around the block a few times.	['ass']
Kathie Lee	11	0	Hmmm, how about a little more of that good lovin' Chef?	[]
Chef	16	1	Damn woman, I just gave you sweet loving five minutes ago. You trying to kill me?	['damn']
