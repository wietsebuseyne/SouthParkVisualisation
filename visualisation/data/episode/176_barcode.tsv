Mr. Garrison	24	0	Okay children, let's all take our seats.  Before we get started today, Wendy Testaburger has asked to share something with the class. Wendy?	[]
Wendy	60	0	Thank you Mr. Garrison.  Fellow students, October is Awareness Month for one of the leading causes of death among women. A terrible disease that takes the lives of American women every day. I'm talking, of course, about breast cancer.  An estimated one in six women will deal with cancer in their lifetime, and breast cancer is the most common-	[]
Cartman	4	0	She said it again.	[]
Wendy	15	0	Is there a problem?! Because breast cancer isn't funny! Breast cancer is killing people!	[]
Cartman	13	0	Mr. Garrison, do we really need all this potty talk in the classroom?	[]
Mr. Garrison	6	0	Eric, for the love of Jesus...	[]
Wendy	13	0	This is a serious issue, Eric! What you're doing is very offensive!	[]
Cartman	26	2	Me? You're the one talking about killer titties.  Watch out, guys. Wendy said boobs can kill people.  Grrr. Gonna get you. Gonna get you, Wendy!	['titties', 'boobs']
Butters	8	1	I don't wanna get killed by boobs.	['boobs']
Wendy	13	0	Will somebody do something? Every week he gets worse and nobody does anything!	[]
Mr. Garrison	4	0	Eric, stop being offensive.	[]
Cartman	17	0	I'm just trying to engage Wendy in a constructive dialogue about breast cancer awareness, Mr. Garrison.	[]
Wendy	4	0	No you aren't!	[]
Cartman	27	1	Wendy, you need to calm down. You're gonna get your boobs all angry and they're gonna start killing everyone.  Dude, I'm on fire today!	['boobs']
Cartman	38	2	Look out, everyone. There's some killer titties on the loose.  Could've swore I heard them coming through the roof.  Pssht! Officer! We need to get an APB out on those titties! They're armed and dangerous!	['titties', 'titties']
Wendy	9	0	What is your problem?! Breast cancer isn't funny!	[]
Cartman	19	1	Not at all.  Wendy, we're gonna get you Wendy. We're your boobs, we're gonna kill you!	['boobs']
Wendy	12	0	You'd better shut up  or I'll make you shut up!	[]
Cartman	10	0	Oho, really? What are you gonna do about it, Wendy?	[]
Wendy	13	1	I'm gonna kick your ass! That's what I'm gonna do!	['ass']
Cartman	7	1	Haha, you're gonna kick my ass?	['ass']
Wendy	9	1	That's right, I'm gonna kick your ass!	['ass']
Cartman	9	0	You wanna throw down, dawg? I'll throw down.	[]
Wendy	5	0	You think you're tough?	[]
Cartman	2	0	Whassup?  Whassup?	[]

Wendy	9	0	After school! We fight after school! You got that?!	[]
Cartman	7	0	You're gonna fight me after school?	[]
Wendy	3	0	That's right!	[]
Cartman	5	0	You're a chick, dude.	[]
Wendy	18	0	As soon as that bell rings, we do it outside, you got that?! And you better be there.	[]
Cartman	5	1	Oh, it's on, bitch!	['bitch']
Wendy	5	1	You're gonna  fucking die!	['fucking']
Butters	16	0	Wendy and Eric are fightin' after school! Hey everybody!  Wendy and Eric are fightin' after school!	[]

Kindergartners	1	0	Yaaay!	[]
Red	11	0	Hey emo kids, Cartman and Wendy are gonna fight after school.	[]
Pete	6	0	Did she just call us emos?	[]
Butters	12	0	Jeez, I can't believe Wendy's gonna fight you after school.	[]
Token	4	0	She is pissed off.	[]
Cartman	26	0	She is not gonna show up to a fight, dawg. I'm sure she's already trying to figure a way to get out of it.	[]
Clyde	33	0	Hey, check it out. She's totally staring you down.  She sure seems confident. You should probably go easy on her, dude. You don't wanna put her in the hospital or anything.	[]
Cartman	17	1	Yeah, I'm just gonna teach her a lesson. I'm not gonna totally... kick her ass.	['ass']
Jimmy	21	0	Can't go too easy on her though. God forbid she actually gets in a good good punch and... beats ya.	[]
Butters	17	1	Yeah, heh.  If you got beat up by a girl, everyone would think you were a faggot.	['faggot']
Cartman	9	0	Wendy, could I talk to you for a second?	[]
Wendy	1	0	What?!	[]
Cartman	10	0	Wendy, I want to apologize, and um, tell you that-	[]
Wendy	1	0	What?	[]
Cartman	45	0	I want to apologize, and tell you that... I'm sorry for what I said. Okay? It was wrong of me, and I promise you that it won't happen again. I don't wanna fight you after school, all right? So, I'm sorry.	[]
Wendy	13	0	If you're really sorry, you can say it in front of everyone!	[]
Cartman	25	0	Actually, I was thinking... let's just keep this between us. I was wrong to make fun of breast cancer, and I'm very remorsefulness.	[]
Wendy	19	0	No! If you're really sorry, and you wanna apologize to me, then do it in front of everyone!	[]
Cartman	13	1	Pfft, apologize?!  That's not what I said, you dumb bitch. Heheh, heheh.	['bitch']
Wendy	18	0	Yes you did! You just stood there and said you apologize and you don't want to fight!	[]
Cartman	29	0	Oh Wendy, such a desperate attempt to get out of it. These students are a little too smart to see you're just making excuses not to fight me.	[]
Wendy	17	2	I don't want an excuse! I'm going to beat the fucking shit out of you!	['fucking', 'shit']
Cartman	31	0	Ohhh, ahhhh... That's funny. You're gonna die, you lesbo.  Wendy, seriously though, I do want to apologize. I'm really sorry and I don't think we should fight.	[]
Wendy	4	0	Get away from me!	[]
Michael	16	0	So, everyone's saying there's gonna be a fight between Eric Cartman and your girlfriend.	[]
Stan	3	0	I guess so.	[]
Pete	25	0	And you're gonna... just let that guy... beat up on your woman? Doesn't that like, go against your jockey man code or something?	[]
Michael	17	0	Yeah, I don't ever remember AC/DC singing about letting dudes beat up on their girlfriends.	[]
Stan	8	0	What am I supposed to do about it?	[]
Craig	26	0	Don't worry, Stan, I don't think the fight's even gonna happen. Cartman said that Wendy's already begging him to call it off.	[]
Jimmy	5	0	I'll bet she is!	[]
Butters	14	1	Ah I hope not! I wanna see Eric kick the crap out of her!	['crap']
Cartman	3	0	Wendy. Wendy psst.	[]
Wendy	1	0	What?!	[]
Cartman	49	2	Psst real, real quick. Just psst, real quick.  Wendy, you're not gonna believe this.  I just found out my mom has breast cancer.  Man, I sure got what was coming to me! I was a real jerk, and now they're gonna cut off my mom's boobs.	['jerk', 'boobs']
Wendy	9	0	You really think that's gonna work on me?!	[]
Cartman	18	0	Wendy,  I have here twenty-seven dollars in cash. If you just call off the fight then I-	[]
Wendy	9	0	You can't bribe your way out of this!	[]
Cartman	5	0	Wendy, I have muscular dystrophy.	[]
Wendy	4	0	No you don't.	[]
Cartman	8	1	My mom has muscular dystrophy. In her boobs.	['boobs']
Wendy	46	2	You don't get it, asshole!  There is nothing you can do to stop this fight! I am going to wipe the playground with you right in front of everyone! I am going to shove your ass down your throat and make you eat your underwear!	['asshole', 'ass']
Cartman	3	0	Eat my underwear?	[]
Wendy	3	0	That's right.	[]
Cartman	12	0	Okay. Okay Wendy. I will eat my underwear. Right here, right now.	[]
Wendy	10	0	Jesus Christ, do you have no sense of self-respect?!	[]
Cartman	17	0	No. U-unless you want me to. You want me to have self-respect, then I will.	[]
Wendy	5	1	You fucking suck so hard!!	['fucking']
Cartman	20	0	I'll eat my underwear, Wendy.  And then you'll be satisfied. We can put this whole thing behind us.	[]
Wendy	4	0	What are you doing?!	[]
Cartman	16	0	I'm committed to peace, Wendy.  I want you to see just how humbled I am...	[]
Wendy	1	0	Ew!	[]
Cartman	8	0	Euugh. Wendy? Look at me Wendy.  There. Yeahm.	[]
Wendy	3	0	Oh my God!	[]
Cartman	4	0	So...  are we cool?	[]
Wendy	1	0	No!	[]
Cartman	13	1	I ate my underwear!  What the hell do you want from me?!  Weh-	['hell']
Wendy	4	0	You are so pathetic!	[]
Cartman	17	0	Wendy it isn't fair!  I ate my underwear for you! Nooo!  Yo, what's up dawg?	[]
Cartman	7	0	Stan, Stan! Dude, we need to talk.	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Cartman	13	0	You know, Wendy and I are supposed to fight in like three hours.	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah?	[]
Cartman	35	2	Dude, aren't you worried? Wendy's a girl. She could end up getting really hurt, Stan. You're my bro, and she's your bitch. I don't wanna hurt my bro's bitch.	['bitch', 'bitch']
Stan	11	0	I can't do anything; she really wants to fight you.	[]
Cartman	46	1	Nu-no, she doesn't. She told me she doesn't wanna fight. She's just stuck, Stan. Because she knows I'm gonna kick her ass, but she feels like if she doesn't fight me all the kids are gonna call her a chicken.	['ass']
Stan	1	0	Really?	[]
Cartman	90	1	You know what she did? She apologized and begged me not to fight her. I said Well Wendy, if you're so sorry, then say it in front of everyone. But she wouldn't. That's how desperate she is. Man you have to do something, Stan. You have to be a fuckin' man and forbid her from fighting, so she has a way-  Oh, that's where I put those.  Anyway, Stan, you've got to put a stop to this fight. Wendy's stuck and she needs you.	['fuckin']
Stan	9	0	Dude, there's nothing I can do about it.	[]
Cartman	24	3	God, you are such a pussy, Stan! You're such a pussy! When I hurt Wendy, it's gonna be on your fucking head!	['pussy', 'pussy', 'fucking']
Mr. Garrison	30	0	And so you see, at this point Euripides knew he could not win the battle.  All right kids, for your homework tonight I want you all to read chapters seven...	[]
Bebe	7	1	Kick the shit out of him, Wendy!	['shit']

Mr. Garrison	10	1	Eric, did you just take a crap on my desk?	['crap']
Cartman	12	1	Whassup? Whassup? Crapped on your desk, dawg. What's up with that?	['crapped']
Butters	1	0	Huh.	[]
Mr. Mackey	21	0	Welcome to detention, m'kay? You are here until your parents come and pick you up. Use your time to study.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Ahhh, sweet.	[]
Butters	25	0	Eric. Hey Eric.  Eric, wha-what's goin' on? Everyone is startin' to say you got detention on purpose to get out of fightin' Wendy.	[]
Cartman	4	0	What?! That's ridiculous!	[]
Butters	17	1	But some people think you crapped on Teacher's desk, uh to get out of the fight.	['crapped']
Cartman	7	0	That's not why I did it.	[]
Craig	9	1	Then why'd you crap on Garrison's desk?	['crap']
Cartman	23	0	Because I'm hardcore. You know, I'm I'm antiestablishment. That's how I roll, dawgs. I do hardcore stuff like that.	[]

Mrs. Testaburger	18	0	Well, do you want to explain why this little boy's mother had to come talk to us?	[]
Mr. Testaburger	13	0	Did you tell this little boy you were going to beat him up?!	[]
Wendy	8	0	You don't understand. He said horrible things.	[]
Cartman	18	0	The, the thing is, I totally said I was sorry, but she still wants to beat me up.	[]
Mrs. Testaburger	19	0	Wendy, no matter what a person says, you don't respond with violence. Haven't we taught you that?	[]

Pete	9	0	Yeah, I guess you've dodged a bullet, Galahad.	[]
Jimmy	14	1	I always knew deep down that Wendy didn't have any ba-ba-balls.	['balls']
Clyde	20	0	And so, we must all recycle. Every day. Recycling is important, and it will save our planet, Earth. The End.	[]
Mr. Garrison	20	0	Very nice, Clyde. Okay, we have time for one more report before recess. Who'd like to go?  Okay Eric.	[]
Cartman	51	1	Thank you. My report today is on breast cancer awareness.  I do not believe enough is being done, and, like the victims of breast cancer, there's something I'd like to get off my chest.  We all must fight, and hopefully one day, titty cancer will be a distant mammary.	['titty']
Wendy	11	1	You unbelievable bastard. You beat me but you won't stop.	['bastard']

Wendy	11	0	No ma'am, there isn't going to be a fight.	[]
Principal Victoria	5	0	Oh no? Are you sure?	[]
Wendy	3	0	Yes ma'am!	[]
Principal Victoria	25	0	I see.  I've noticed all the things you've done for Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Did you know I'm a breast cancer survivor?	[]
Wendy	2	0	Ma'am?	[]
Principal Victoria	54	1	I was diagnosed seven years ago. Cancer is... pure evil. It is a fat little lump that needs to be... destroyed.  When there is a cancer, you have to fight it. You can't reason with cancer, you can't wish it away. Cancer doesn't play by the rules, so neither can you.	['fat']
Wendy	7	0	My... parents said that if I fight-	[]
Principal Victoria	29	0	And you can't listen to what anybody else tells you.  You have to be willing to give up everything, because the cancer will  take everything. Do you understand?	[]
Wendy	3	0	Yes ma'am!	[]
Principal Victoria	29	1	When you have cancer you fight, because it doesn't matter if you beat it or not. You refuse to let that fat little lump make you feel powerless!	['fat']
Bebe	11	0	She's gonna fight! Wendy's gonna fight Cartman right now!	[]
Millie	1	0	What?	[]
Cartman	7	1	Go deep, Craig.  Not that deep, retard!	['retard']

Butters	7	0	But Wendy's coming to fight you.	[]
Cartman	1	0	...Huh?	[]
Clyde	5	0	Oh boy here we go!	[]
Butters	2	0	All right!	[]
Pete	5	0	It's about freaking time.	[]
Craig	6	0	All right, let's DO IT!	[]
Cartman	19	0	What- what's up?  What what's up?  Wendy, don't forget: I'll tell my mom on you.	[]
Wendy	4	0	I don't care!	[]
Cartman	17	0	Um, recess is almost over, I don't I don't know if there's really time.	[]
A Girl	4	0	Shut up and fight!	[]
Cartman	11	0	All right, fine Wendy!  I'll fight ya you big bully!	[]
Kids	1	0	Ohhhhh!	[]
Butters	4	1	Fuck him up, Wendy!	['fuck']
Mr. Mackey	1	0	Wendy?	[]
Wendy	3	0	I'm finished!	[]
Mr. Mackey	6	0	Eh somebod - somebody call the principal!	[]
Cartman	43	0	You don't have to say anything. I know how it is. I'm no longer the cool kid. Now you all think I'm a fahahahahahag.  My school life is over 'cause now all the guys don't think I'm coooohoohoohoohoohooooool.	[]
Stan	7	0	Dude, we never thought you were cool.	[]
Cartman	9	0	That's not true. You're just saying that.	[]
Kyle	8	0	No, really. We've always thought you suck.	[]
Jimmy	14	0	Yeah, nothing's changed. Our opinion of you can't possible go any lower.	[]
Cartman	11	0	You're all just saying that to make me feel better.	[]
Craig	9	0	No, it's true. We've always hated you.	[]
Butters	2	0	Well yeah.	[]
Cartman	37	0	Don't try and make me feel better, you guys, it isn't... Wait, wait a minute. Why would you guys be saying stuff to make me feel better? Unless... unless you do think I'm cool.	[]
Craig	1	0	What?	[]
Cartman	61	0	If you're all trying to make me feel better, then you must still like me. Oh, oh phew! Oh, you had me so worried about what you guys were gonna think of me getting beat up by a girl and... it turns out you think I'm cool no matter what. Oh, oh, oh God, what a relief!  Oh, yay!	[]
