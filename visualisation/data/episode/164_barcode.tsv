Butters	9	0	WAAAA! It's Alien!  Predator! Wha?  Huh?  WAAAAAH! HAAAAAAAA!	[]
Stan	22	0	Look, we already told you everything we know. Some guy just showed up in a big balloon and took us into Imaginationland.	[]
General	24	0	What we want to know is how! We need to find a way into Imaginationland; you've been there! How did you do it?!	[]
Kyle	7	0	We just... went on a balloon ride.	[]
Specialist	10	0	There must have been some kind of portal or doorway.	[]
Stan	5	0	Dude, we don't remember.	[]
General	25	0	Do you realize what's goin' on here?! Terrorists have attacked our imagination, and now our imaginations are running wild!  You'd better start remembering!	[]
Specialist	7	0	It was the Chinese, wasn't it?	[]
Kyle	1	0	...What?	[]
Specialist	20	0	We've suspected that the Chinese government was working on a doorway to the imagination.  Is that where you were?!	[]
Stan	1	0	No.	[]
General	17	0	That's it, isn't it?! Where do the Chinese keep this portal? How does it work?	[]
Specialist	5	0	It is better than ours?	[]
Stan	2	0	Your what?	[]
Specialist	17	0	Our portal to the imagination built as a secret project back in 1962 to fight the Soviets-	[]
General	6	0	Shhh! Tom! That's super-secret.	[]
Tom	5	0	Ohh, I'm sorry sir.	[]
Kyle	11	0	Wait. The U.S. Government has a portal to the imagination?	[]
General	16	0	Aw, see? Good job, Tom! Why don't you just tell them everything about Project X?!	[]
Tom	23	0	Yes sir.  We built a portal to the imagination to use against the Russians during the Cold War, but we never got a-	[]
General	10	1	THAT WAS SARCASM. I was being sarcastic, you fucking idiot!	['fucking']
Tom	7	0	Aw jeez, I'm really sorry sir.	[]
Stan	15	0	If you already built a doorway to the imagination, then why do you need us?	[]
General	13	1	All right, we might as well show it to them.  God-dammit, Tom.	['dammit']
Cartman	68	3	Every night, the dream is the same.  I'm on my way to visit my friend Kyle, because we had a bet that if I could prove leprechauns were real, he would suck my balls.  And it turns out I was right. Time to pay up, Kyle.  But then...  NO! NOOO!  It's been taken from me. I have dry balls. Balls so dry they explode like dust.	['balls', 'balls', 'balls']
Elderly woman	3	0	You okay, kid?	[]
Cartman	13	1	NO. I've got dry balls. And I'm running out of time.	['balls']
General	29	0	Ever since the Cold War, the U.S. Government has been working on a secret project to build a doorway into the imagination. It is called Project Imagination Doorway.	[]
Stan	5	0	That's not very imaginative.	[]
General	16	0	According to all the tests and the data, the doorway should work, but... it never has.	[]
Lead tech	9	0	But we're close, sir. We're real close.	[]
General	9	0	They've been saying that for over forty years.	[]
Lead tech	13	0	You're the ones, right? The kids who have been in the imagination.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Ah I guess.	[]
Lead tech	24	0	What was the sequence that got you inside? We know there's some kind of... resonance code, but we can't figure it out.	[]
Kyle	26	0	Look, we're sorry, you guys, but the balloon just went up in the air and the dude sang a song and we were suddenly there.	[]
General	10	0	Song? You didn't say anything about a song before.	[]
Lead tech	2	0	What song?	[]
Stan	3	0	The Imagination song?	[]
Lead tech	18	0	That could be it. The fractal converter has never worked because it was waiting for a multitonal code!	[]
General	8	0	Quick boys: how does the Imagination Song go?	[]
"Stan, Kyle"	2	0	Imaginaaaation Imaginaaaation	[]
Operator	20	0	Sir, uh I'm getting some electrofeedback from the gate. Ih it's weak, but it's nanoresponding to something.	[]
Lead tech	15	0	Was there more to the Imagination Song? Ha, how does the rest of it go?	[]
"Stan, Kyle"	2	0	Imaginaaaation. Imaginaaaa-	[]
Kyle	7	0	No, no dude, it went up there.	[]
Stan	3	0	Imagina-he-hey-	[]
Kyle	2	0	Imagina-eh	[]
Stan	11	0	Dude, we don't remember. It was really long and stupid.	[]
General	24	0	I'm just about through playing with you boys! We're running out of time! You have to remember that song in its entirety!	[]
Lollipop King	8	0	Mayor, Mayor, what are we supposed to do?	[]
Butters	10	0	Please, sir. I have to get home to my world.	[]
Fanciful Mayor	14	0	Oh, well. All you have to do is tap your heels together three times.	[]
Butters	1	0	Really?	[]
Fanciful Mayor	8	2	NO, you fucking dipshit, that was a joke!	['fucking', 'dipshit']
Snarf	9	0	Mayor, what are we supposed to do, shnarf shnarf?	[]
Fanciful Mayor	9	0	Get to Castle Sunshine! It's your only hope!	[]
Lollipop King	2	0	Castle Sunshine?	[]
Fanciful Mayor	25	0	Through the Gumdrop Forest. Others will be hiding there; go, run! Look out for the evil characters! They're assembling on the Yum Yum mountain!	[]
Orc	9	0	We are free! Now all of Imaginationland is ours!	[]
The Minotaur	14	0	Not all, foolish orc! There are still parts of Imaginationland we don't control.	[]
Freddy Krueger	11	0	Tomorrow, we shall build our own castle right on this spot!	[]
The Minotaur	13	0	Who put you in charge, Krueger?! I am the most evil character here!	[]
ManBearPig	5	0	Nonsense!  Your evil is stale!	[]
Headless Horseman	7	0	I am the most evil imaginary character!	[]
Squirrelly Squirrel	20	0	Now come on y'all. We shouldn't be fightin', we're supposed to all be on the same side.	[]
Critter	7	0	Yeah. You're all right, Squirrelly Squirrel.	[]
Woodland Critters	1	0	Yaaaay!	[]
The Minotaur	6	0	What evil imaginary characters are they?	[]
Creature from the Black Lagoon	15	0	They were dreamt up by some fourth grade kid as part of his Christmas Story..	[]
Squirrelly Squirrel	27	0	Now come on y'all. We can't waste time arguing, there could still be survivors out there. We need to hunt them down, and kill them.	[]
Rabbity Rabbit	4	0	And eat their flesh!	[]
Beavery Beaver	7	1	B'hut first we should rape them!	['rape']
Beary Bear	18	1	How about we kill them, and then rape their bodies so we can use their blood as lubricant?	['rape']
Squirrelly Squirrel	8	0	Say, that's a great idea, Beary Bear.	[]
Jason Voorhees	14	0	Man, I do not want to meet the kid that dreamt THOSE things up.	[]
Cartman	20	1	Look, I want some Goddamn answers! You brought my friend here to Washington! Where is he?! What is going on?!	['goddamn']
Secretary	8	0	I'm sorry, sir. That information is classified.	[]
Cartman	15	0	Something is going on, and I have a right to know where my friend is!!	[]
Secretary	13	0	There's somebody asking a lot of questions about what's going on.	[]
Tom	31	0	Let me handle this!  I'm sorry, but there is no such thing as Project Imagination Doorway!  Imagination Doorway. It was started in the Sixties as a secret government project. Right.	[]
"Stan, Kyle"	4	0	Imagina-a-ation, Imagina-	[]
Stan	17	0	Waitwaitwait, maybe that's where he went really flat, like that half-step key change? Imagina-ation.	[]
Kyle	11	0	Right, then it was Imagina-ation, Imagina-ation. Imagina-atio-on	[]
Lead tech	6	0	It's open! It's open!	[]
Operator	19	0	Getting readings from the other side... the, that's it. We've made an opening to our imagination, sir!	[]
General	27	0	All right, that's enough! We've still got a lot of work to do, people! Its time to go in and get our imaginations under control!	[]
Butters	6	0	How much further to Castle Sunshine?	[]
Snarf	11	0	Snarf, I'm not sure snarf snarf. I've never been.	[]
Butters	3	0	What was that?	[]
Lollipop King	7	0	Over here.  Oh Christ. Its Strawberry Shortcake.	[]
Strawberry Shortcake	7	0	Please, let me go.  Wuh.  Wuh!  Dugh!	[]
Snarf	4	0	Oh my God! Snarf.	[]
Strawberry Shortcake	3	0	Aaaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaaah!	[]
The Minotaur	3	0	Now kill her!	[]
Squirrelly Squirrel	17	0	Whoa whoa, hang on, y'all. You can't just kill her. That's not evil enough.	[]
Freddy Krueger	9	0	What do you mean? We cut out her eyeball.	[]
Jason Voorhees	5	0	Yeah, that's super hardcore.	[]
Squirrelly Squirrel	11	0	Now come on y'all. We can do better than that.	[]
Beavery Beaver	12	0	Hey! I know! Let's all pee in her empty eye socket!	[]
Deery Deer	15	0	Let's make her eat her own eyeball, and then pee in her empty eyesocket.	[]
Beary Bear	17	0	How about we get someone with AIDS to pee in her eyesocket, so she dies all slowlike?	[]
The Minotaur	4	0	Nobody here has AIDS!	[]
Woodland Critters	1	0	Awwww!!	[]
Beary Bear	13	0	But we've got to have AIDS before we pee in her eyesocket!	[]
Squirrelly Squirrel	18	0	Now don't be down y'all. I bet we can find some AIDS out in the forest.	[]
Lollipop King	4	0	Dude, run, run, ruuun!	[]
General	46	0	All right, men. We don't know what you'll experience on the other side of this doorway, but it will most likely be really weird. If you reach our imagination, you are to take every step necessary to get it under control! Are you ready?	[]
Soldiers	2	0	Yes sir!	[]
General	5	0	Are you ready, Kurt Russell?	[]
Kurt Russell	15	0	I... I don't understand why I'm here. I I'm just an actor.	[]
General	27	0	Yes, but you were in that one movie that was kinda like this. That gives you more experience than anybody. All right, here we go! Men! Forwaaard!	[]
Tech 1	6	0	Sir, we have a security breach!	[]
General	1	0	What?!	[]
Tech 3	13	0	There's an Unauthorized Entry Alert, sir-it's coming from Sector Two!	[]
General	2	0	Sector Two??	[]
Kyle	1	0	Cartman??	[]
Cartman	11	0	Hello Kyle! Thought you could get out of your responsibilities, huh?!	[]
General	5	1	Who the hell are you?!	['hell']
Cartman	22	1	That kid you have made a bit that if I could prove that I saw a leprechaun, he would suck my balls!	['balls']
General	5	0	Get him out of here!	[]
Cartman	16	0	No! Hold on a second!  I have a contract  validated by the United States court system!	[]
General	13	1	Let me see that!  Why would you agree to suck someone's balls?	['balls']
Kyle	13	1	I DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GOD-DAMNED LEPRECHAUN!!	['damned']
General	18	0	All right, you two can go use the conference room. Go on, we have work to do here.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Wha?! Well wait, ahah I wanna see what happens here!	[]
General	17	0	You signed an agreement, kid. We don't have time for this. Go on and do it.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Stan?	[]
Stan	6	0	Dude, you did make a deal...	[]
Cartman	6	0	Theee conference room is which way?	[]
Cartman	16	0	Here we are, Kyle. You tried to bail out on our agreement, but I found you.	[]
Kyle	11	0	I didn't bail, I got picked up by the government!	[]
Cartman	31	2	Well we're here now, that's all that matters.  Care for some nuts? Oh, that's right. I guess you'll be chock full of nuts in a few minutes.	['nuts', 'nuts']
Kyle	23	0	Cartman, do you even know what's going on? We went to Imaginationland, terrorists attacked it, and now the government is about to-	[]
Cartman	40	1	Oh jeez, I'm sorry, Kyle.  It's just that I'm so completely bored by this story. See, I'm really only interested in the part where the leprechaun was real, and so you have to suck my balls.	['balls']
Kyle	12	0	Okay, fine. You know what? Let's just get it over with!	[]
Cartman	23	0	Oh nonono, nononot so fast, Kyle.  I've waited a long time for this, and I intend to savor each and every second.	[]
Kyle	17	0	No, I'm serious! I wanna see what's happening downstairs, so let's just do it!	[]
Cartman	41	1	Not... just yet, Kyle. There's still a few things I need to do.  By the way, I should tell you that I haven't had a chance to shower while making my way up here. My balls are...  extra vinegary...	['balls']
Kyle	5	0	Just get to it already!	[]
Lead tech	6	0	Entering the portal in five seconds.	[]
General	8	0	Kurt Russell, can I get a comm check?	[]
Kurt Russell	3	0	Check 1, 2.	[]
General	14	0	Good luck men! Godspeed!  What do we have?! Kurt Russell, can you hear me?	[]
Kurt Russell	7	0	We're here. We're s-somewhere.	[]
Tech 3	6	0	They are inside the imagination, sir.	[]
General	6	0	What do you see in there?	[]
Kurt Russell	48	0	There's lots of... big mushrooms, colorful grass, some castles in the distance, eh... Wait. Something's coming for us! It's coming out of the bushes and-  It's a-! ...Oh, Aw, it's just a cute little squirrel.  Hey, it talks, haha. The little squirrel talks.	[]
Lead tech	5	0	Awww, an imaginary talking squirrel.	[]
Techs	1	0	Awww.	[]
General	10	0	Ask the squirrel what it knows about the terrorist attack.	[]
Kurt Russell	19	0	Wait a minute, eh. The squirrel has friends. Oh why, why it's a whole bunch of woodland critters.	[]
Stan	3	0	Wait, woodland critters...	[]
Kurt Russell	20	0	There's a talking bear and a beaver, uh... the, they seem to be Christmas critters. Well hello. Yes, hi.	[]
Stan	5	0	Get them out of there!	[]
General	1	0	What?	[]
Stan	6	0	Tell them to get away now!	[]
General	4	0	What's the matter?	[]
Kurt Russell	28	0	Oh the... cute little bear's eyes are starting to glow red now... Uh hello there, little animals, do you happen to know how to huh? OW! AAAAAAAHHHH!	[]
General	6	0	Kurt Russell, what's going on?!	[]
Kurt Russell	8	0	They're raping mee!! They're raping meee!!!	[]
General	6	0	Get out of there, Kurt Russell!	[]
Kurt Russell	18	0	They're raping all of us! Whoaho! Oh it hurts! They're raping us and it huuurts! Waaagh!	[]
Cartman	19	0	I was thinking of using a high-speed shutter with a low depth of field. What do you think?	[]
Kyle	13	1	Goddammit Cartman, will you stop wasting time? I wanna get this over with!	['goddammit']
Cartman	59	2	No, you're right, Kyle. A higher depth of field will make sure everything stays in focus.  There we go.  Now, Kyle, when you're sucking my balls, are you gonna think about how right I was about the leprechaun, or are you just gonna try and focus on how rough and salty my balls feel in your mouth?	['balls', 'balls']
Kyle	5	0	Let's just DO IT!	[]
Cartman	30	2	In time, Kyle. You certainly are eager for balls, aren't you? Are you ball-famished? Balls-starving? You see, Kyle, I wonder if at this moment you are actually-	['balls', 'balls']
Guard	7	0	Everyone to the main hall now! Go!	[]
Cartman	10	0	Uh, no, no, we're not done in here yet.	[]
Guard	6	0	Everyone to the main hall NOW!	[]
Cartman	3	1	No! Goddammit no!	['goddammit']
Snarf	10	0	Boy snarf snarf, my feet are really gettin' tired snarf.	[]
Butters	13	0	Aww, Sn-Snarf, could you maybe like sh-shut up for five minutes?	[]
Lollipop King	12	0	Wait! There it is. We made it!  Castle Sunshine!  Hurry! Get inside!	[]
Perseus	15	0	The evil imaginary characters are approaching! Lock down the gates! Prepare to fire the cannons!	[]
Butters	2	0	Wait! Waaait!	[]
Perseus	5	0	What imaginary character are you?!	[]
Lollipop King	7	0	The Lollipop King? From the Lollipop Forest?	[]
Snarf	8	0	And I'm Snarf. Snarf, snarf snarf snarf.	[]
Perseus	6	0	And what imaginary character are you?	[]
Butters	11	0	Oh, uhh, uh I'm not imaginary. Ah I'm Butters.	[]
Perseus	4	0	What's a Butters?	[]
Snarf	15	0	The Mayor brought him and some other kids into Imaginationland just before the terrorist attack.	[]
Perseus	21	0	So YOU came from the real world at precisely the same time as the terrorists! That seems like quite a coincidence!	[]
Butters	20	0	I, well I was just playin' with my friends, and then, wu-we caught a leprechaun, and then this guy-	[]
Perseus	6	0	You caught the Leprechaun? Take him!	[]
Snarf	8	0	Perseus! He's not against us snarf snarf!	[]
General	7	0	Talk to me! What's going on?!	[]
Lead tech	10	0	Something is... coming through the gate from the other side.	[]
Operator	3	0	What is it?!	[]
Tech 4	7	0	Its like a... half man half bear!	[]
Lead tech	3	0	And half pig!	[]
Tech 5	12	0	Oh! No, no wait! It's like a half bear half manpig!	[]
General	2	0	Look out!	[]
Lead tech	13	0	No! I think it's more like a half man, and half pigbear!	[]
General	7	0	Reverse the doorway! Send it back through!	[]
Kyle	1	0	AAAHHH!	[]
Stan	1	0	KYLE!!	[]
Kyle	1	0	AAAAAAAAAAAA-	[]
Butters	11	0	Please! I didn't help the terrorists get into Imaginationland! Honest!	[]
Perseus	9	0	That is for the Council of Nine to decide!	[]
Lollipop King	21	0	Don't worry, kid, the Council of Nine consists of some of the most highly-regarded imaginary characters in all Imaginationland	[]
Aslan	22	0	Fellow Council, these are indeed dark times. The evil forces amass at our gates as we speak. Zeus believes we should evacuate.	[]
Zeus	18	0	Yes. Their power outmatches ours. If they are giving us a chance to leave we must take it!	[]
Aslan	5	0	And what say you, Morpheus?	[]
Morpheus	17	0	How our we to know that they will let us go? Their offer could be a trap.	[]
Glinda	16	0	Perhaps we must flee to the Temple of Alderon. Surely they wouldn't chase us there.	[]
Jesus	26	0	No, we can't. Come on, you guys, this is our home. We have to fight, to keep it the way it was meant to be.	[]
Luke Skywalker	25	0	I'm with Jesus. The evil characters aren't going to just us go.  That may be, Popeye, but we don't have a choice!	[]
Perseus	15	0	Forgive my intrusion, Council of Nine, but this boy has infiltrated from the real world.	[]
Aslan	3	0	Bring him here!	[]
Paramedic	7	0	Clear!  I'm sorry. He's gone.	[]
Cartman	5	0	No! Kyle can't die.	[]
Paramedic	5	0	I'm sorry, young man.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Kyle?	[]
Paramedic	13	1	Well... at least now he doesn't have to suck anyone's balls.	['balls']
Cartman	17	0	NNNOOO!  No, he has a strong heart! He wants to live! Come on, Kyle! Come on, buddy!	[]
General	5	0	He's gone, little boy.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Zap him again!  Do it!	[]
Paramedic	1	0	Charging.	[]
Cartman	5	0	DO IT!  Come on buddy.	[]
Paramedic	1	0	Clear.	[]
Cartman	38	1	Come on buddy.  Get out of here!  Godammit Kyle, you never walked away from anything in your life! Now fight!  Fight! Fight! Right now!  Fu-hight! Fu-hu-hight!  Fight!  Give him some air.  There, easy. Breathe easy.	['godammit']
Aslan	19	0	I believe this child was brought into Imaginationland for a reason. Perhaps the Mayor knew something we don't.	[]
Zeus	15	0	What are you saying, Aslan? That if we are to take back control, we might-?	[]
Morpheus	19	0	Yes. If we are to take back control from the evil forces, this little boy might be the key.	[]
Butters	19	0	Awww, I'm the key? Could I not be the key, Morpheus? I don't wanna be the key.	[]
Luke Skywalker	18	0	If you ever wanna see your home again, little boy, you'll have to rise to this challenge.	[]
Butters	28	0	But I, but I'm supposed to be at school right now, uh, and instead I got, I got Snarf and Popeye and Luke Skywalker all pissed off...	[]
Aslan	25	0	It is a dark time for all of us, young boy. But know that if you believe in yourself, everything will turn out all right.	[]
Tom	6	0	Sir? Are you sure about this?	[]
General	24	0	We have no choice. Terrorists have attacked us where we are most vulnerable. There's no other option.  We have to nuke our imagination.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Wake up, Kyle.	[]
