Teller	7	0	How can I help you, young man?	[]
Stan	28	0	I got a hundred dollar check from my grandma, and my dad said I need to put it in the bank so it can grow over the years.	[]
Teller	38	0	Well that's fantastic, a really smart decision, young man. We can put that check in a Money Market Mutual Fund, then we'll reinvest the earnings into foreign currency accounts with compounding interest aaand it's gone.	[]

Teller	7	0	It's gone. It's all gone.	[]

Teller	6	0	Not anymore you don't. POOF.	[]
Stan	10	0	Well, what can I do to get back my money-?	[]
Teller	12	0	I'm sorry sir, but this line is for bank members only.	[]

Announcer	12	0	This, is a 9 News Special Report. RECESSION: A NATION IN PERIL	[]
Anchor	26	0	An economic crisis has hit South Park and the nation like never before. Another South Park bank has closed down, leaving thousands of people in debt.	[]
Mr. Garrison	20	0	It's just crazy, you know? Ev-everyone's affected by it. It's like all the money just... vanished.	[]
Stephen	22	0	It's really terrifying. We... we've got no money to pay our mortgage now. We could very easily lose our house!	[]
Butters	2	0	Hi, Grandma!	[]
Darryl Weathers	17	0	First the money started goin', and now everyone's gettin' laid off work! They took arrr jawbs!	[]
Worker 1	4	0	They took our jobs!	[]

Sharon	5	0	All right everyone, eat up.	[]
Randy	9	0	Aw Jesus Christ! Sliced hot dogs and tomato slices?!	[]
Sharon	19	0	You said we had to be very careful with our money. I've got nothing for our food budget.	[]
Stan	9	0	Mom, Dad, how come there's suddenly no money?	[]
Randy	156	1	I'll tell you what happened, son! See, there's a bunch o' idiots out there who weren't happy with what they had!  They wanted a bigger house and materialistic things that they didn't even need.  People with no money who got loans to buy frivolous things they had no business buying.  And these assholes just blindly started buying any stupid thing that looked appealing,  'cause they thought money was endless!  It goes back to when the government had the idea that everyone in America deserves to own a house. So we have people having a hard time paying their loans,  meaning less money coming in.  And the idiots couldn't see that by doing all this frivolous spending they were mocking the Economy. And they made the Economy very angry.  We're all feeling the Economy's vengeance because of materialistic heathens who did stupid things with their money! Do you understand, son?	['assholes']
Stan	6	0	Yeah, I think I get it.	[]
Orator 1	50	0	And so why is our economy failing us? Because the government kept interest rates too low for too long! The government took our economy for granted and now we are all here paying the price! How long will we sit and watch our economy just-? As the people we must...	[]
Orator 2	51	1	...An angel came to me and so I say to you: Do not listen to the Wall Street brokers! For they are the ones that put us in this situation! Fat cats with corporate greed! They are the ones who knowingly drove us down this pathway of doom! Our responsibility is...	['fat']
Cartman	62	4	And where has all the money gone? It must have gone somewhere! The answer is obvious, my friends! It is the Jews! Covetous Jews who have taken all our money and hoarded it for themselves! Hidden all the cash in some... secret Jew cave that they built, probably back in the early 60s! It is the Jews, my friends, who are oft...	['jews', 'jews', 'jew', 'jews']
Randy	83	0	There are different people casting all different kinds of blame from person to person. But the fault lies in all of you!  YOU, who bought that three hundred thousand house when you only had twenty thousand to put down? YOU, who bought that third car, even though only two people in your home drive! It is time to stop pointing fingers!  Finger pointing gets us nowhere, Steve! We have mocked our Economy. And now the Economy has cast its vengeance upon us all!	[]
Man 1	3	0	He's right.	[]
Man 2	9	0	This is the first guy to actually make sense.	[]
Randy	47	0	Yea, it is an angry and unforgiving Economy. To repent we must stop frivolous spending! Instead of paying for cable let us watch clouds! Instead of buying clothes, wear but sheets from thine beds! Cut spending to only the bare essentials! Water and bread and margaritas, yea.	[]
Clerk	12	0	Hello young man, welcome to Sur la Tahbluh. Can I help you?	[]
Stan	10	0	Yeah, I wanna return this Margaritaville my stupid dad bought.	[]
Clerk	54	0	Oh, that's all we get anymore, returns. Could you please just put the receipt here on this tahbluh.  Sorry, our computers are a little slow today. We need a new Ethernet cahbluh. Oh, I'm sorry, sir, I'd like to give you a refund but I'm afraid it's not doahbluh.	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Clerk	17	0	I said I'm not ahbluh, sir. You see, this Margaritaville was purchased with a payment plan?	[]
Stan	1	0	So?	[]
Clerk	25	0	Well an outside financing company handles those payment plans. Customers just pay for some of the machine and the finance company pays for the rest.	[]
Stan	16	0	Well can't I just return it and get the money my dad put in back?	[]
Clerk	42	0	Hm... that's improbahbluh,  but not impossibluh. I'm not really sure how it works; you'll, you'll have to speak with the people at the top. I can give you the finance company's address if that... agreeahbluh with you.	[]
Randy	103	0	We have become lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of the Economy! There are those who will say that the Economy has forsaken us! Nay! You have forsaken the Economy!! And now you know the Economy's wrath! O thoust can shop at a sporting goods store, but knowest thou that the Economy will take away thy Broncos' cap from thine head!  Mock the Economy without fear! Thine own stockbrokers... now lie dead by their own hand and thou knowest that thy stockbrokers did not fear the Economy! Well here we are, my friends! You have brought the Economy's vengeance upon yourselves!	[]
Gerald	5	0	What can we do, Randy?	[]
Man 3	3	0	Yes tell us.	[]
Man 4	2	0	Tell us.	[]
Man 5	5	0	Tell us what to do.	[]
Man 6	7	0	Tell us, Randy, what we should do!	[]
Man 7	5	0	What should we do, Randy?!	[]
Randy	69	0	We must all wear sheets instead of buying clothes that need detergent! Instead of cars that take gasoline we can... get around on llamas from Drake's farm! Instead of video games that take batteries and software, our kids will play with squirrels! We must let the Economy know that we are capable of respecting it! No more needless spending!  The Economy is our shepherd. We shall not want.	[]
Al	2	0	Mornin' Ted.	[]
Ted	2	0	Mornin' Al.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Well this sucks!	[]
Clyde	10	0	Sure was better when our parents were buyin' us stuff.	[]
Cartman	30	0	Hengh!  Of all the times for people to decide to stop buying things, it had to be the week that Grand Theft Auto 4 comes out for Nintendo DS!  Hengh!	[]
Kyle	7	0	You want something new every week, fatass.	[]
Cartman	12	0	Don't you fraternize me! This is all your fault, you know!	[]
Kyle	2	0	My fault?	[]
Cartman	10	1	The Jews took all the money away, and they ha-!	['jews']
Kyle	9	0	Don't even start! Don't even start, Cartman!	[]
Butters	11	0	Well,  why are we wearin' bedsheets and playing with squirrels, Kyle?	[]
Kyle	10	1	Not because of the Jews, Butters! Who told you that?	['jews']
Butters	3	0	Well Eric did.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Just tell us where the cave is, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	79	0	Now look! The reason we're in this situation is because people are being stupid! The economy isn't some vengeful being that takes things away from us. The economy is just made up of people, and people have just lost their faith in it.  What people really should be doing is spending more. Spending is fine. People should just go outside. People should just go outside. They should buy the things they need for their friends and family	[]
Man 8	18	1	We best speak with the Council, and tell them.. a young Jew is speaking heresy towards the Economy.	['jew']
Receptionist	4	0	Can I help you?	[]
Stan	5	0	I wanna return this Margaritaville.	[]
Receptionist	8	0	O-kay, let me send you into Josh.	[]
Josh	15	0	Heeey, welcome to Big Orange Finance Company, yeah. Have a seat. You want some Carmex?	[]
Stan	23	0	No thanks. I wanna return this Margaritaville, and the guy at Sur la Table said that you were the company that financed it.	[]
Josh	8	0	Oh yeah no, you know what? No, yeah.	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Josh	26	0	Yeah, we can't give you your money back for that, yeah, no. You'd have to talk to the people on Wall Street, yeah, mmmm.	[]
Stan	2	0	Wall Street?	[]
Josh	39	0	Yeah, no, see, what I do is find Americans who want a frozen beverage machine but can't afford one, and I hook them up with investors who want to get into the margarita bill payment plan business, yeah.	[]
Stan	1	0	So?	[]
Josh	26	0	Yeah, so the problem is your Margaritaville payment plan has been combined with thousands of others into one big Margaritaville security, yeah, no. Yeah. No. Yeah...	[]
Stephen	24	0	The entire town has given over to your ways, Mr. Chairman. Everyone has even stopped using electricity so as to stop paying electrical bills.	[]
Father Maxi	31	0	You've really done an amazing thing, Mr. Marsh. People have learned to hold on to their money so as not to feel the sting of the Economy's mighty sword.	[]
Randy	22	0	I am pretty smart, yea. But I have assembled this economic committee to make sure that everyone sticks to my new plan.	[]
Skeeter	35	0	We've got guards posted at the mall to make sure nobody gets tempted to buy dumb stuff. And, uh, Pat Sallsman is doin' house checks to make sure nobody is ordering anything stupid online.	[]
Randy	9	0	Then perhaps soon our Economy will return to us.	[]
Man 9	19	1	Council, I bring news of discord! A young Jew was in the town square speaking blasphemy about the Economy!	['jew']
Randy	1	0	What?!	[]
Man 9	21	0	He was saying that... your ideas are false and the Economy is not vengeful. He was rallying people to spend more!	[]
Father Maxi	6	0	Spend more?! What mockery is this?!	[]
Randy	14	1	Relax, Father Maxi. What harm can one Jew do against our... economic recovery movement?	['jew']
Cartman	40	0	I had a dream last night. I was in a field, and I had Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars right next to me. But then the sky went black and ...Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars just... melted in my hand.	[]
Kyle	3	0	What's that?	[]
Man 10	8	0	'Scuse me, we need to borrow your squirrels.	[]
Kyle	1	0	What?	[]
Mr. Garrison	3	0	Now please, please!	[]
Man 10	3	0	You have sinned!	[]
Mr. Garrison	6	0	Oh Jesus, I'm sorry. Please.	[]
Kyle	4	0	What's going on?	[]
Man 10	13	0	Garrison, you have brought your filth to this town for the last time!	[]
Kyle	4	0	What did he do?	[]
Man 11	13	0	Your teacher was caught buying a KitchenAid Stand Mixer at Bed Bath & Beyond!	[]
Man 10	4	0	Take that punishment, heathen!	[]
Kyle	5	0	Hey! Hey, stop it! Stop!	[]
Man 10	10	0	Move aside, kid! He must pay for his stand mixer.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Come on, this is ridiculous!	[]
Man 10	14	0	What's ridiculous about hucking squirrels at a man who has angered the Economy?!	[]
Kyle	38	0	Ju-just have a little compassion, huh? I mean, everyone's gone out and bought something stupid. It's not so bad. Whichever of you guys has never bought anything frivolous, go ahead and huck the next squirrel.	[]
Mr. Garrison	1	0	Oh.	[]
Stan	12	0	'Scuse me. 'Scuse me! I'd like to return this Margaritaville, please?	[]
Stockbroker	1	0	Margaritaville?	[]
Stan	24	0	My dad bought it on a payment plan that was set up by a finance company which got their principal investors from somebody here.	[]
Stockbroker	4	0	Oh, that makes sense.	[]
Stan	2	0	It does?	[]
Stockbroker	31	0	You see, son, we lump thousands of these Margaritaville installment plans together into Margaritaville-based securities, then chop those securities up in a way that we could sell them to banks.	[]
Stan	8	0	So I can return it to a bank?	[]
Stockbroker	25	0	Nope, because a bunch of people like you are defaulting on their Margaritavilles so the government had to buy the Margaritavilles assets from the banks.	[]
Stan	1	0	What?!	[]
Stockbroker	27	0	Just talk to the Treasury Department in DC. They're the ones who really understand how all this works.  Oh, sell sell sell sell sell sell sell!	[]
Stan	1	0	Aargh!	[]
Kyle	116	0	Listen, this is all you need to know: the economy is not a supernatural all-knowing entity. The economy is just an idea, made up by people, thousands of years ago. The economy is not real. And yet, it is real. Nowadays they'll give credit to practically anyone who applies for them.  I applied for this yesterday to prove a point. It is an American Express Platinum card.  It has no spending limit.  Do not be afraid! This is only plastic. It's just something made up by people. Truly meaningless until we put our faith in it. Faith is what makes an economy exist. Without faith, it is only plastic cards and paper money.	[]
Man 11	25	1	By all reports, the young Jew is not letting up! He is still going around convincing people to have faith in the Economy by shopping!	['jew']
Randy	54	1	We've done everything we can and yet the Economy has not improved. Worse, it has declined! Poor Bart here just lost his job at Little Caesar's Pizza. Our tireless work is obviously being undermined by this one Jew. Why does he go around pretending to know the true will of the Economy?	['jew']
Stephen	12	0	Perhaps... he is the Economy's only Son, sent to save us.	[]
Father Maxi	26	2	Are you retarded, Stotch?! The Economy is omnipotent! Which means it can do anything! So saying it would be limited to one Son is fucking stupid!	['retarded', 'fucking']
Randy	13	0	That is stupid, yea. And going around telling people to shop... is dangerous!	[]
Man 12	13	1	Well then, there's only one option: we have to kill the Jew.	['jew']
Father Maxi	8	1	Yep, I think we gotta kill the Jew.	['jew']
Skeeter	20	1	I don't know... He's got a lot of support. It might be hard to even catch this Jew.	['jew']
Cartman	39	1	Did somebody say catch a Jew? The person you're after might be hard to get, but I can bring him to you. And all I want in return... is Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars for handheld Nintendo DS.	['jew']
Treasurer 1	8	0	Uhh, how can we help you, young man?	[]
Stan	40	0	I want to return this Margaritaville! My dad bought it on a payment plan set up by a finance company that got investors from Wall Street who combined it into securities sold to the banks who transferred it to you!	[]
Treasurer 1	4	0	Ohhh that makes sense.	[]
Stan	1	0	Nnnaaargh!	[]
Treasurer 1	21	0	No problem. We just need to consult the chart. We can determine your property's value and we'll be done.	[]
Stan	3	0	Really?  Thank you.	[]
Treasurer 1	3	0	Be right back.	[]
Treasurer 2	17	0	Excellent news, sir. We've determined the investment value of your Margaritaville to be... ninety trillion dollars.	[]
Stan	1	0	What?!	[]
Jimmy	13	0	Hey, what's the matter, Kyle? You seem b-b-bu-bbbummed out.	[]
Kyle	16	0	I just have a feeling this might be the last time we get to do this.	[]
Butters	19	0	Well don't worry Kyle. We're not gonna let people kill you. We'll keep you hidden forever!	[]
Kyle	25	0	I can't just hide my whole life, Butters. And besides, I have this strange feeling that one of you is gonna totally betray me.	[]
Cartman	47	1	All right, whoever is thinkin' of betraying Kyle, that is not cool!  That's freaking lame, dude! Kyle is trying to get the economy goin' again! If somebody is thinking of stabbing him in the back, you're b-you're being a dick!  Go ahead, Kyle.	['dick']
Kyle	33	0	Whoever it might happen to be, I'm not giving him the opportunity. Tomorrow I'm going to do something. Something I've known I would have to do restore people's faith.	[]
Jimmy	16	1	Kyle please! For fu-fu for for-fu-fuck's sake, don't do anything drastic.	['fuck']
Kyle	21	0	There's no choice anymore, guys. Don't worry about me. I've been preparing for this for a while now.	[]
Stan	17	0	Nononono excuse me! I don't understand! How can this stupid thing be worth ninety trillion dollars?!	[]
Treasurer 1	7	0	What, you think it's worth more?	[]
Stan	7	0	No, dude, that doesn't make sense!	[]
Treasurer 2	18	0	Well, you don't get ninety trillion dollars, but the chart says that's what it's worth.	[]
Treasurer 3	5	0	Uh oh, problem! Problem again!	[]
Treasurer 2	4	0	What is it now?	[]
Treasurer 3	15	0	Another insurance company is about to go under; if they do, people could lose millions!	[]
Treasurer 1	9	0	Okay, no problem.  We'd better consult the chart.	[]
Treasurer 3	7	0	Sirs, another insurance company is going under!	[]
Sir 1	8	0	Now determining most prudent move for insurance company.	[]
Treasurer 1	1	0	Bailout!	[]
Treasurer 3	6	0	Most prudent move is a bailout!	[]
Sir 1	5	0	Bail out the insurance company!	[]
Man 13	4	0	It's a miracle.	[]
Man 14	5	0	Why would someone do this?	[]
Randy	7	0	What is this? What's going on?	[]
Stephen	16	1	There! Look!  It's the Jew. Somehow he got a platinum AmEx with no spending limit.	['jew']
Randy	4	0	What's he doing?	[]
Stephen	7	0	He's... paying for everyone's debts.	[]
Darryl Weathers	9	0	Hey thanks, kid, this is really nice of you.	[]
Randy	9	0	But that's... impossible. Why would he do this?	[]
Man 15	8	0	So that people will have money to spend.	[]
Sheila	7	0	Kyle!  Kyle, you have to stop this!	[]
Kyle	4	0	It's okay, Ma.	[]
Sheila	22	0	No-o Kyle, you'll be in debt for the rest of your life!  Please, somebody, get him to sto-o-op!	[]
Randy	9	0	Uh there's about seventeen thousand dollars' worth here.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Heunh.	[]
Man 16	11	0	He paid for our debts so we could spend once more.	[]
Man 17	3	0	He's dead.	[]
Dr. Doctor	12	0	No, he's just passed out. We should get him to bed.	[]
Anchor	37	0	For the first time in almost a year, the economy in South Park has taken a small, but noticeable upturn.  Stores and shopping malls are open again as newly debt-free people feel safe... to make purchases.	[]
Randy	28	0	Wow, the new Margaritaville!  With salsa dispenser! Just pour your favorite salsa in the top and it comes out the dispenser in the bottom. Oh, we need this!	[]
Anchor	47	0	Are we out of the woods yet? Only time will tell. But we must not forget the sacrifice one person made to restore our faith and make us believe in the economy once again. The person we must thank every day for his amazing sacrifice.  Barack Obama.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Aww, come on!	[]
