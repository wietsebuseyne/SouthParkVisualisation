Stan	3	0	Where's dad?	[]
Sharon	9	0	He's upstairs videotaping your grandfather in the bathtub.	[]
Stan	1	0	Why?	[]
Sharon	20	0	Because ever since your father got that stupid video camera he thinks he has to film everything the family does.	[]

Stan	18	0	You guys! You guys, check this out: I saw another Peruvian flute band outside my house last night.	[]
Cartman	1	0	So?	[]
Stan	23	1	So? So I just sat there and watched them for a while and, guess how much money they made selling their crappy CDs?	['crappy']
Cartman	2	0	How much?	[]

Kyle	3	0	Two hundred dollars?	[]
Cartman	4	0	Really? Are you sure?	[]
Stan	27	0	Yeah dude, I'm- I'm starting to realize that it's like the easiest job in the world. You know, I mean, we could do that!	[]
Kyle	5	0	...Become a Peruvian flute band?	[]
Stan	22	1	Yeah, why not? We get some instruments and some costumes and then... make some crappy pan flute music CDs on my computer.	['crappy']
Cartman	13	1	Oh my god. We're gonna make so much fucking money you guys.	['fucking']
Stan	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Woohoo!)	[]
Kyle	15	0	But where are we gonna get the money to buy costumes and and the instruments?	[]
Cartman	7	0	Craig, dude, how're you doing, bro?	[]
Craig	1	0	...Fine.	[]
Cartman	21	0	Cool, awesome. Um, Craig, remember how you were tellin' us how your grandma gave you a hundred bucks for your birthday?	[]
Craig	1	0	...Yeah.	[]
Stan	14	0	Craig, how would you like to turn that hundred dollars into a thousand dollars?	[]
Cartman	8	0	Come on in, Craig. Have a seat. Welcome.	[]
Craig	5	0	What do you guys want?	[]
Kyle	11	0	Craig, we have chosen you to join our Peruvian flute band!	[]
Cartman	3	0	All right Craig!	[]
Craig	12	0	You mean like those guys you see at all the tourist spots?	[]
Stan	24	0	There's a reason they're everywhere, Craig: because they make bank! We just need your money to buy instruments and make some CDs.	[]
Cartman	10	0	And we'll double your money in one afternoon, Craig.	[]
Craig	34	0	You guys never hang out with me. You never invite me to do stuff. But now you want me to be in a band with you because my grandma gave me a hundred dollars.	[]
Cartman	6	1	Craig, don't be an asshole.	['asshole']
Craig	6	0	I'll go get the money.	[]
Stan	16	0	All right guys, just like we rehearsed it. You ready Craig? All right, let's jam!	[]
Cartman	8	0	And a one, and a two, and a-	[]
Man 1	6	0	Wow, that's such cultural music.	[]

Stan	2	0	Jesus Christ!	[]
Cartman	7	0	No, no es bueno! No trabajar aqui!	[]
Michael Chertoff	63	0	Ladies and gentlemen, our nation and our world is facing an economic and ecological crisis of disastrous proportions. I'm talking of course about Peruvian flute bands.  The red dots indicate where the highest concentrations of Peruvian flute bands are. All over the world, wherever there are tourists or shoppers, there are now, on average, 65 Peruvian flute bands per square kilometer. General?	[]
Chief Aide	21	0	France, Japan, and the northeastern United States are currently the hardest hit. Make no mistake:  this is a pan flute epidemic.	[]
Senator 1	3	0	A pan-demic?	[]
Michael Chertoff	32	0	Three countries in Asia and seven in Europe have already asked for our help in getting rid of their Peruvian flute bands. We will need every resource available to see this through.	[]
Senator 2	6	0	Excuse me, but... aid other countries?	[]
Michael Chertoff	1	0	Senator?	[]
Senator 2	21	0	With all due respect we need to be dealing with our own pan flute bands! Let other countries fend for themselves!	[]
Michael Chertoff	52	1	You heartless bastard! This country was founded on beliefs in freedom and integrity! And we will not sit back and do nothing while less fortunate countries are ravaged by Peruvian flute bands! Is that clear?!  As director of Homeland Security, I am taking control of the military until the crisis is contained.	['bastard']
Paratrooper	2	0	Go, go!	[]
Cartman	5	1	Ha!  Serves you right, assholes!	['assholes']
Soldier 1	4	0	One more over here!	[]
Soldier 2	6	0	Let's go! Get 'em out!	[]
Soldier 3	13	0	Clear out, move! This is a Homeland Security operation, people, let's go!	[]
Stan	3	0	Hey, back off!	[]
Soldier 3	9	0	Make sure all pan flute music CDs are contained!	[]
Randy	20	0	There's Sharon and Shelly. They're watching some television. Wave to the camera, Shelly.  What are you watching, guys?	[]
Sharon	2	0	The news.	[]
Randy	1	0	Huh?	[]
Sharon	5	0	We're watching the news.	[]
Randy	26	0	That's the TV in our living room, still showing commercials right now.  What do you think about the television, Shelly?  Oh, the news is starting!	[]
Anchorman Tom	84	0	The government efforts to stop the Peruvian flute band crisis are now in their third day.  In cities all over the world  flute bands have been removed and quarantined.  But more may still be out there. Homeland Security's requesting that  if you see a Peruvian flute band, do not approach it. Mark down the flute band's location, and do not, under any circumstances, buy their CDs.  The flute bands that have been contained are being taken to a quarantined area in Miami.	[]
Stan	23	0	Eh-excuse us. Hello?  Uh excuse me. Sir? Sir, there's been a misunderstanding. Can, can I talk to you for a minute?	[]
Kyle	11	0	Sir? Sir, can we talk to you for just a second?	[]
Guard	11	1	Get back! I'm not buying any of your damned CDs!	['damned']
Stan	14	0	No. Sir, there's been a biiig misunderstanding. We actually aren't a Peruvian-	[]
Guard	19	1	I said I'm not buying any God damned CDs today, you got that?! I'm sick of it!	['damned']
A Musician	5	0	Senor? Comprar CD la musica?	[]
Kenny	7	1	(Jesus Christ, he fucking shot that guy!)	['fucking']
Craig	40	1	Hey, Craig. You know that money your grandma gave you for your birthday? How would you like to invest in a Peruvian flute band? You can double your money in one afternoon. Come on, Craig, don't be an asshole.	['asshole']
Michael Chertoff	4	0	Attention Peruvian flute bands:	[]

Translator	8	0	Donde pasar el resto de sus vidas. Gracias!	[]
Kyle	9	0	Guantanamo Bay?! We can't go to Guantanamo Bay!	[]
Stan	19	0	Don't worry you guys. I'm sure our parents are freaking out right now trying to find us.	[]
Sharon	26	0	Please, Mr. and Mrs. Tucker, our boys were last seen hanging out with your son Craig. Do you have any idea where they could've gone?	[]
Mrs. Tucker	16	0	No, I'm telling you. This isn't like Craig at all. I'm really worried.	[]
Mr. Tucker	6	0	You've checked with the police?	[]
Gerald	13	0	Nobody know anything. It's li-it's like the boys just vanished!	[]
Sharon	26	0	None of the other kids have seen them since a-  Randy, will you put that thing down?! What is wrong with you?! Our son is missing!	[]
Randy	8	0	Hey, I'm worried about him too, Sharon.	[]
Sharon	8	0	Well then stop being an idiot and help!	[]
Mr. Tucker	14	0	Maybe the boys all ran away. Were any of your boys upset about anything?	[]
Gerald	16	0	All we know is they were seen hanging out with Craig and now they're gone.	[]
Sheila	13	0	That's exactly why I told Kyle not to hang around that boy.	[]
Mrs. Tucker	6	0	What is that supposed to mean?	[]
Sharon	14	0	To be honest, Mrs. Tucker, we think Craig is bad influence on our boys.	[]
Mrs. Tucker	5	0	Now wait just a minute!	[]
Sharon	11	0	I'm just saying that your son has some problems a-	[]
Mr. Tucker	8	0	Like every kid doesn't have some problems!	[]
Sheila	10	0	Obviously Craig has gotten them into some kind of trouble.	[]
Mrs. Tucker	3	0	Oh my God!	[]
Mr. Tucker	3	0	This is ridiculous!	[]
Randy	4	0	Ohhh this is good!	[]
Gerald	4	0	That's not ridicul-	[]
Soldier 4	21	0	Sir, good news! Looks like we did it. Every major city is reporting zero Peruvian flute bands. We got 'em all!	[]
Michael Chertoff	26	0	Calm down people, we still have work to do! We have to take out the place these flute bands came from so they never come again!	[]
Official 1	21	0	We don't know where they came from, sir. We... we've been researching, but we... can't figure it out.	[]
Michael Chertoff	13	0	Well think about it, idiot! Where else would Peruvian flute bands come from?	[]
Official 1	1	0	Hmm...	[]
Michael Chertoff	6	0	The country is in the name!	[]
Official 2	15	0	No. Sir, we checked the entire map. There isn't a country called Peruvian anywhere.	[]
Michael Chertoff	8	1	Not Peruvian, retards, Peru! It's right here!	['retards']
Official 3	2	0	Peh-roo.	[]
Michael Chertoff	15	0	Now I want a plan in place to take out Peru once and for all!	[]
Official 1	10	0	Is that really necessary, sir? It seems a little extreme.	[]
Soldier 2	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Michael Chertoff	15	0	Peruvian flute bands will never stop annoying us  unless they are stopped at the source!	[]
Chief Aide	17	0	Sir, you'd better come quick. One of the pan flute bands was caught trying to escape.	[]
Michael Chertoff	4	1	See?  God damn it!	['damn']
Michael Chertoff	6	0	The Llama Brothers: Tapas and Moodscapes.	[]
Stan	13	0	This is a mistake, sir, we aren't really a Peruvian flute band.	[]
Michael Chertoff	26	0	Right. You just play pan flute music at the mall and sell CDs of you with a llama, but you're not a Peruvian flute band.	[]
Stan	17	0	We... we- we're just kids, you know? We, we were just trying to make some money.	[]
Kyle	5	0	We just wanna go home.	[]
Kenny	14	0	(Sir, please, I'm supposed to get laid for the first time on Saturday.)	[]
Michael Chertoff	7	0	Which tourist location were they playing at?	[]
Chief Aide	5	0	An outdoor mall in Colorado.	[]
Kyle	13	0	Look, we're from Colorado! We, we grew up in the United States.	[]
Stan	4	0	We we speak English!	[]
Cartman	4	0	And we're White.	[]
Michael Chertoff	13	0	Let me talk to you guys out here.  Well what do you think?	[]
Chief Aide	48	0	I don't know what to make of it sir. It's like nothing I've ever seen before. Clearly they are a Peruvian flute band and yet they... aren't. They play pan flute music like the others, but they talk and act like ...one of us.	[]
Michael Chertoff	9	0	I agree. They're obviously some kind of... hybrid.	[]
Official 1	7	0	A hybrid? Ah how is that possible?	[]
Chief Aide	13	0	Perhaps a Peruvian flute band mated with one of our females. Who knows?	[]
Michael Chertoff	18	0	Well however they came to be, they're about the only piece of good luck we've had.	[]
Official 1	1	0	Sir?	[]
Michael Chertoff	23	0	If they are the hybrid we're talking about,  then they could be our way of taking out Peru once and for all.	[]
Craig	64	0	Do you guys know why nobody else at school likes hanging out with you?  Because you're always doing stuff like this. You're always coming up with some stupid idea to do something, and then it backfires, and then you end up in some foreign country, or in outer space or something. That's why no one likes hanging out with you guys.	[]
Cartman	6	0	You're being extremely negative, Craig.	[]
Michael Chertoff	27	0	All right, here's the deal: Maybe you are on our side and maybe you aren't, but if you help us... we'll get you home.	[]
Stan	3	0	Help you how?	[]
Michael Chertoff	26	0	You're able to walk amongst the Peruvian flute bands. They see you as one of them. We are going to send you to their Capital.	[]
Craig	7	0	Can we please just go home, sir?	[]
Michael Chertoff	24	0	We still don't know whose side you're on! You do this, and we'll know! You leave for Peru in the morning.	[]
Kyle	10	0	No! No, I'm not going to Peru! Not Peru!	[]
Stan	3	0	Kyle, calm down.	[]
Kyle	8	0	You know I can't go there, Stan!	[]
Stan	12	1	One of our friends was raped in Peru. It was very traumatic.	['raped']
Michael Chertoff	22	0	You don't have a choice! Either you go to Peru, or you get locked up forever with the other flute bands.	[]
Soldier 3	22	0	Thompson, can you come over here?  The flute band players won't shut up about something and I can't understand them.	[]
Musician 2	11	0	Por favor! No podemos ir! Estamos aqui para proteger a ustedes!	[]
Musician 3	1	0	Si.	[]
Other Musicians	6	0	Si. No podemos ir. Si, protectores.	[]
Thompson	15	0	They're saying something like, You can't send us away. We are the protectors.	[]
Soldier 3	3	0	Protectors from what?	[]
Musician 2	6	0	La muerte peluda! La muerte peluda!	[]
Soldier 3	4	0	What does that mean?	[]
Thompson	7	0	I think he said, the furry death?	[]
Musician 2	6	0	La muerte peluda. La muerte peluda!	[]
Announcer	3	0	This is CNN.	[]
Anchorman Tom	37	0	The last of the Peruvian flute bands have successfully been eradicated from every part of the world. Paul Harris is at the shopping promenade and Paul, pretty nice not having any Peruvian flute music there, I suspect.	[]
Paul Harris	41	0	Really welcome silence, Tom. There hasn't been a Peruvian pan flute band in sight for days now, and everyone is really enjoying the peace. The world can breathe a collective sigh of relief now as we thank the-  What the?!	[]
Woman 2	3	0	Oh my Gohhhd!	[]
Woman 3	1	0	Ohmigod!	[]
Paul Harris	2	0	Jesus Christ!	[]
Shopper	1	0	AAAAHHH!!	[]
Paul Harris	26	0	There's, there's something else here, it's...  It's not a Peruvian flute band, it's a... Oh my God what is that thing?!	[]
Anchorman Tom	6	0	Paul Paul, what do you see?	[]
Paul Harris	7	0	It's furry! It's very furry!	[]
Anchorman Tom	29	0	Okay obviously something different has uh shown up a-... Did he say furry?  Okay uh we're we're experiencing some uh-  My God what is that thing?!  AAAHHH!!	[]
Pilot	27	0	All right, we're about 800 kilometers from Peru. There'll be a truck to take you inside the border where you're briefed on mission specifics.	[]
Craig	63	1	Was there ever a moment when you guys first came up with the genius plan to become a Peruvian flute band that any of you said Hey, you know? This plan might backfire.  No, that never occurred to you. Because you guys are jerks, and you never learn from your mistakes, and that's why everyone at school thinks you guys are assholes.	['assholes']
Kyle	12	0	That's not true. Kids at school like us. Don't they?	[]
Stan	23	1	Yeah dude, kids at school totally like us. Craig is just being a dick because we're having a tough time right now.	['dick']
Craig	5	1	I'm being a dick?	['dick']
Stan	1	0	Yes!	[]
Craig	31	1	You guys took my birthday money, got me arrested and sent to Miami with no way home except to take down the country of Peru, and I'm being a dick?	['dick']
Cartman	7	0	There's no talking to this guy.	[]
Stan	27	0	All right, fine, Craig. When we get back home we'll get you your money back, and we'll never talk to you again. How's that?	[]
Craig	6	0	That would be great. Thank you.	[]
Kyle	19	0	This is wrong. Uh this just doesn't make any sense. Why would Homeland Security send us into Peru?	[]
Kenny	9	0	(Because they're trying to take over the world?)	[]
Kyle	19	0	Ah, I don't know, it just feels like... there's got to be something else going on here.	[]
Sharon	52	0	Please, I don't know where else to turn. The police haven't been any help, ugheh, I think our boys might really be in trouble this time. Yes. Yes. Please, check and call me right back. Thank you.  Randy I swear to God if you don't put that thing away...!	[]
Randy	16	0	Sharon, you're gonna be really glad I have all this footage of the family someday.	[]
Sharon	15	0	I mean it Randy that's enough!! You don't have to videotape every single-!!	[]
Randy	5	1	What the hell was that?	['hell']
Sharon	3	0	Oh my God.	[]
Randy	8	0	Something's going on outside! Stay, stay here!	[]
Shelly	5	0	What's going on, Dad?	[]
Randy	6	0	Get back to your room, Shelly!	[]
Randy	4	0	What's going on?	[]
Mr. Garrison	6	0	They're all over the place!	[]
Randy	2	0	What are?!	[]
Mr. Garrison	4	0	They're really furry!	[]
Randy	7	0	What did that?!  What is that thing?!	[]
Officer Barbrady	13	0	Mr. Marsh, you have to move! It isn't safe to be here!	[]
Linda	1	0	AAAAAAAAH!!	[]
Randy	3	0	Oh my Gohhhd!	[]
Stephen	8	0	Go go go go back the other way!	[]
Randy	15	0	Oho, oh God, oh God, oh God.  Oh God.  I'm  I'm so  Startled.	[]
A Woman	3	0	Oh my Gohhhd!	[]
Randy	1	0	HAAA!	[]
Chief Aide	7	0	Sir? We've got a bigger problem.	[]
Michael Chertoff	6	0	Oh? And what might that be?	[]
Chief Aide	23	0	New reports are coming in from cities all over the world. Word of massive destruction and death by what ap-pear to be...	[]
Michael Chertoff	2	0	Guinea pigs?	[]
Chief Aide	6	0	Yes sir. How did you know?	[]
Michael Chertoff	14	0	You were so close to figuring it all out, Davis, did you know that?	[]
Davis	1	0	Sir?	[]
Michael Chertoff	18	0	I really thought you had me in Miami, but you just couldn't quite put the pieces together.	[]
Davis	8	0	You... You... knew this was going to happen.	[]
Michael Chertoff	63	0	Oh, this is only the beginning, Davis, and I can't let you interfere.  Sorry my friend, but I've worked too hard to make all this happen. The pan flute bands are on their way to their deaths, the guinea pigs are rising, and the only person who could have stopped all this... is on his way to the middle of nowhere.	[]
