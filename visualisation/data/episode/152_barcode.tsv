Narrator	51	1	The year is 2006, and young Eric Cartman cannot wait for the new Nintendo Wii to come out. Unable to cope with the wait any longer, Eric decides to freeze himself for three weeks. But a freak avalanche makes Eric impossible to find, and so he remains frozen for 500 years.	['freak']
Otter Leader	5	0	Whoa, steady!  This way, otters!	[]
Otter 1	15	0	This is it. New New Hampshire. We have risked much bringing you here, Time Child.	[]
Cartman	19	0	Can it. You otters may have evolved to the point you can talk, but I don't need lectures.	[]
Otter 1	15	0	Don't let the time child out of your sight. He could try to run.	[]
Cartman	19	0	We have a deal, Blavius. As long as I get what I want, you have nothin' to worry abuot.	[]
Otter Leader	5	0	Something is spooking the ostriches.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Sure. This is Monarch land now. Probably Jarvis probes everywhere.	[]
Otter Leader	6	0	Here it is! We have arrived.	[]
Blavius	27	0	Hold!  This is it, Time Child.  The old museum of technology, abandoned long ago. Let's get what you want, Time Child, and get out of here.	[]
Cartman	19	0	Over here!  Yeah it's here! It's here! The Nintendo Wii... I've waited so long for this.	[]
Blavius	19	0	All right, Time Child, we've filled our side of the bargain. Now return with us to Otter Bay.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Sorry Blavius. I've got other plans.	[]
Blavius	1	0	NOOOO!	[]
Otter Leader	4	0	It was a trick!	[]
Blavius	5	1	SCIENCE DAMN YOU, TIME CHILD!	['damn']
Cartman	7	0	I got it! I got the Wii!	[]
UAA Leader	5	0	Time Child! You've returned!	[]
UAA 1	13	0	We thought for sure you had died in the in the Phobart plant.	[]
Cartman	33	0	Yeah. Lucky for me the otters believed I was on their side.  Do me a favor: next time I'm in a recessed biocave, don't send me a level 2 homing call.	[]
UAA Leader	2	0	TC, wait!	[]
Cartman	16	0	Oh I can't wait! This is gonna be so awesome!  Get out of my way!	[]
UAA Leader	11	0	You gained the otters' trust?! Were you wearing an information crystal?!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Here.	[]
UAA 1	8	0	Science be praised. This could end the war!	[]
UAA Leader	12	0	You've done a great thing, TC.  How can we repay you?	[]
Cartman	19	0	Just send a maintenance guy to my room. I want this Nintendo hooked up to my float screen NOW!	[]
Cartman	13	0	Come on! Come on! Dude, what is taking so long! I wanna play!	[]
Maintenance Guy	26	0	Uhh, what kind of output does this have? This is some ancient Super-VHS output or somethin'. I can't connect it to your flaot screen.	[]
Cartman	15	0	There's gotta be some way to hook it up! It's the freakin' future!	[]
Maintenance Guy	25	0	It may be the future for you, but I can't hook up anything to a float screen without at least a laser-7 output.	[]
Cartman	16	3	You've gotta be shittin' me!! Science-damnit! I am so fucking sick of the future!	['shittin', 'damnit', 'fucking']
UAA Woman	4	0	TC? What's wrong?	[]
Cartman	34	0	I'll tell you what's wrong! I've been waiting 500 years to play the Nintendo Wii! And if I don't get to play real soon, I'm gonna bust a nut!	[]
UAA Woman	22	0	Well, we're all glad you're back. I know somebody who's missed you very much. Come on in, K-10.	[]
K-10	8	0	Bark bark. Hello, Eric. I have missed you.	[]
Cartman	11	1	Suck my balls, K-10. I'm not in the mood.	['balls']
UAA Leader	40	0	Fellow atheists: the time child has returned with information on our sworn enemies, the Allied Atheist Alliance. They have started digging for clams in sector J7. If we mount an all-out attack, we can wipe out their food supply!	[]
UAA 2	5	0	But, those are civilian otters.	[]
UAA Leader	19	0	We cannot tolerate the otters! Their Science is flawed! Their answer to the Great Question is different from ours.	[]
UAA 3	17	0	Yes, but... sending out all our ships at the same time... it would leave our city exposed!	[]
UAA Leader	18	0	...That's why we have to be super-duper sure that nobody finds out we're doing it.	[]
UAL 1	23	0	The United Atheist Alliance is about to send out all its defense ships to take down the Allied Atheist Allieance's clam fields.	[]
UAL 2	14	0	Praise Science. This is your chance, young Shvek, to avenge your father's death.	[]
UAL 3	27	0	Careful, son. Just because their Science leads them to a different answer to the Great Question doesn't mean we have the right to kill them all.	[]
Shvek	93	1	No! Our answer to the Great Question is the only logical one. Our Science is great.  Let us not forget the great Richard Dawkins who finally freed the world of religion long ago.  Dawkins knew that logic and reason were the way of the future.  But it wasn't until he met his beautiful wife that he learned using logic and reason isn't enough. You have to be a dick to everyone who doesn't think like you.  Prepare all the troops! We will level the United Atheist Alliance to the ground!	['dick']
Announcer	14	0	With new Glade monvert cleaner, you can make your monvert sparkle like never before.	[]
Woman	7	0	My monvert's never looked so clean.	[]

Boy Announcer	18	0	I just dial a random number on the keypad, enter a date and year on the debilibrator, and...	[]
Boy 1	23	0	Wow! Someone from the past is on the line!  Hello? Is there a refrigierator running? Well then, you'd better go catch it!	[]

Cartman	11	0	Why didn't anyone tell me there was a time phone?!	[]
K-10	6	0	Why does it matter? Bark bark	[]
Cartman	37	0	Don't you see?? If I get one of those phones, I can call myself in the past and tell me not to freeze myself.  Then I can go back into my time... and play Nintendo Wii.	[]
K-10	18	0	Bark bark. That call is for crank calling only. Using it in the way you describe is illegal.	[]
Cartman	8	0	I care! Where's the closest toy store??	[]
K-10	13	0	Working, bark bark. The Jarvanian shopping comples. But it is not open yet.	[]

Clerk	5	0	Welcome to Zeebod's Toys	[]
Cartman	8	0	I want one of those time-phone things.	[]
Clerk	28	0	Ahh, the Crank Prank Time Phone. Sure. Now, I am required by the state to make sure you know this is for prank-calling the past ONLY, right?	[]
Cartman	9	0	Yeah yeah, I'm only gonna prank-call people.	[]
Clerk	7	0	All right, that'll be 6000 credits.	[]
Cartman	13	0	Six thousand credits?! What do I look like to you? A Thurilian miner?!	[]
Clerk	11	0	This is a pretty advanced piece of equipment. It's expensive.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Look, I have to have one of those phones!	[]
Clerk	10	0	Oh, all right, then I have to have 6000 credits.	[]
K-10	8	0	Bark bark, I'm sorry, Eric, bark bark.	[]
Cartman	9	0	How about a robot? How much for the robot?	[]
K-10	1	0	Awww.	[]
Clerk	14	0	Sorry, kid, you're just gonna have to crank-call people in the present.	[]
Cartman	13	1	Science-damnit!  Wait. K-10, can you access the store's sales records?	['damnit']
K-10	4	0	Working, bark bark. Access.	[]
Cartman	21	0	I want the name and address of anybody who's bought a time phone from this guy in the past week.	[]
K-10	3	0	Working, bark bark.	[]
Blavius	69	0	The United Atheist Alliance has taken the bait! Soon they will send their ships out to destroy our decoy clam fields! And while their ships are away, the United Atheist League intends to attack them! Our plan has worked perfectly! For when the United Atheist League attacks the United Atheist Alliance, we will charge in and kill them all! Our Science, our answer to the Great Question shall prevail!	[]
Otters	6	0	Hail Science! Hail Science! Hail Science!	[]
Blavius	15	0	And I will personally kill the Time Child, and eat his entrails on my tummy!	[]
Man	7	0	I'll get it, darling.  Hello? Hello?	[]
Boy 4	9	0	Uh yes, hello? I'm calling for Mr. Wall?	[]
Man	9	0	I;m sorry, there's no Mr. Wall here.	[]
Boy 4	5	0	Oh. Is Mrs. Wall there?	[]
Man	6	0	Nno, there are no Walls here.	[]
Boy 4	7	0	Then how does your roof stay up?	[]

The Wise One	2	0	Silence, otters!	[]
Otter 1	5	0	It's the Wise One	[]
Otter 2	4	0	The Wise One speaks.	[]
The Wise One	14	0	This is not the path we should be taking. Will more bloodshed end anything?	[]
Blavius	16	0	Wise One, our answer to the Great Question is the only one based on good science.	[]
The Wise One	8	0	Science, reason, is that really all there is?	[]
Blavius	29	0	They are not a logical race, Wise One! They go around chopping down trees for tables, when they have perfectly good tummies to eat on. How logical is that?!	[]
Otter Leader	26	0	Yes!  The great Dawkins said we cannot tolerate those who don't use reason! How reasonable is it to eat off wood instead of your tummy?	[]
The Wise One	49	0	Well perhaps the great Dawkins wasn't so wise. Oh, he was intelligent, but, some of the most intelligent otters I've ever known were completely lacking in common sense. Maybe, some otters do need to believe in something. Who knows? Maybe, just believing in God makes God exist.	[]
Otter Soldier	4	0	Kill the Wise One!	[]
Otter 3	4	0	Kill the Wise One!	[]
The Wise One	3	0	Whoa, wait wait!	[]

Cartman	2	0	Me who?!	[]
Time Child	2	0	Me you!	[]
Cartman	1	0	What?!	[]
Time Child	39	0	I'm you in the future! You have to be patient and wait for the Nintendo Wii to come out, or else you'll wake up in the future and have to deal with a bunch of see otters!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Oh very funny, Kyle!	[]
Time Child	7	0	It's not Kyle, it's you!	[]
Cartman	7	1	Yeah? Well you can go fuck yourself.	['fuck']

Cartman	3	1	Suck my balls!	['balls']
Time Child	12	1	No, you suck my balls!! Just listen to me for one minute!	['balls']
Cartman	5	0	...Okay, you have one minute.	[]
Time Child	26	0	Right before you left for Butters' house, you drank a buncha Ovaltine and put Clyde Frog in the closet so nothing would happen to him, right?	[]
Cartman	5	0	Are you spying on me?!	[]
Time Child	7	1	No, I am you, you stupid asshole!	['asshole']
Cartman	14	3	Fuck you, asshole. You can go fuck yourself!  Come on, Butters, we're going!	['fuck', 'asshole', 'fuck']

Kyle	4	0	What do you want?!	[]
Time Child	34	0	Kyle, you are the smartest guy I know, so I think maybe you're the only person who can understand this. You know how earlier today I asked you to help me freeze myself?	[]
Kyle	15	0	I'm not going to help you freeze yourself, Cartman! It's a stupid idea!	[]
Time Child	39	0	No, see, I know it's a stupid idea. Because, I actually did freeze myself.and... you were right, Kyle. It it backfired and I was frozen for 500 years, and now I'm calling you from the future.	[]
Kyle	2	0	... Uh huh.	[]
Time Child	14	0	No, really, Kyle, I'm I'm seriously. Here, talk to my robot dog.	[]
K-10	6	0	Bark bark. Hello, Kyle. Bark bark.	[]
Kyle	5	0	... I'm hanging up now.	[]
Time Child	16	0	No, Kyle, listen! Please! I think right about now, I'm in my mom's freezer.	[]
Kyle	4	1	Suck my balls, fatass.	['balls']

UAA Leader	6	0	What?! Three-way phone channel onscreen!	[]
Shvek	9	0	What are you otters doing?! This is our attack!	[]
Blavius	8	0	Yes. And we're attacking both of you!	[]
UAA Leader	10	0	You fools! This will be the end of us all!	[]
Blavius	12	0	Then accept our answer to the Great Question, and we will withdraw.	[]
UAA Leader	8	0	Your answer to the Great Question is illogical!	[]
Cartman	5	0	What is the Great Question?	[]
KIT-9	5	0	What atheists should call themselves.	[]
Shvek	8	0	Unified Atheist League is the most logical name.	[]
UAA Leader	6	0	>Unified Atheist Allianace makes more sense.	[]
Blavius	16	0	No! Allied Atheist Alliance! That way it has three A's! That is the logical choice!	[]
Shvek	9	0	So be it. We cannot agree; prepare to die.	[]
Tactical Officer	4	0	Forward missiles launched, sir!	[]
Cartman	23	0	I have to get out of here! Why is everyone in my past so stupid that they think I'm crank-calling them?!	[]
KIT-9	14	0	But Eric, meow meow, you knew the wife of the smartest man in history.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Who?	[]

Mr. Dawkins	2	0	An emergency?	[]
Cartman	9	0	I need to speak to Mr. Garrison right now!	[]
Mr. Dawkins	25	0	I'm sorry, but Mr. Garrison has passed away. Mrs. Garrison is the only person here and she's rather tied up at the moment.	[]

Blavius	23	0	Don't worry, my son. When you return to your time you will merge with your other self. It's all very Zen.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Wait... Isn't... everybody at war over atheism?	[]
Shvek	15	0	Atheism? No. We've learned to get rid of all the isms in our time.	[]
Medic	25	0	Yes. Long ago we realized isms are great for those who are rational, but in the hands of irrational people, isms always lead to violence.	[]
Cartman	9	0	So there is no war now in the future.	[]
Blavius	16	0	Of course there's war. The stupid French-Chinese think they have a right to Hawaii.	[]
All	1	0	Yeah!	[]
UAA Leader	13	0	But now the moment has come to send you back to your time.	[]
Shvek	12	0	We unfroze you for a purpose, and now that purpose is fulfilled.	[]

Liane	4	0	There you are, Eric.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Mom! Mom, they did it!	[]
Liane	18	0	Eric, you have to come home. You can't just wait here for that game to come out.	[]
Cartman	27	0	No, I know. You're right, Mom. I need to learn to be patient. I think I can wait three weeks for Nintendo Wii to come out.	[]
Liane	16	0	But, honey, it's only September. That...  Nintendo Wii doesn't come out for two months.	[]
Cartman	13	0	What? NO!  NOO!!  You sent me back too far!! HEY! Do it over!	[]
Liane	6	0	Who are you talking to, muffin?	[]
Cartman	17	0	I can't wait two months!  I can't! There has to be a way around this!	[]
