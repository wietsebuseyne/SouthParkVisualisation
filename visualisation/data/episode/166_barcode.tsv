Randy	6	0	Sharon, what are the boys doing?	[]
Sharon	10	0	Oh, Stan and Kyle bought a new video game together.	[]
Randy	5	0	They can play guitar now?	[]
Sharon	23	0	No, no, they're just little plastic controllers. You hit the colored buttons and it makes the guitar track on the game play.	[]
Randy	1	0	Ohhh.	[]

Randy	43	0	Well you kids wanna see something really cool?  Check this out.  Once, I rose above the noise and confusion Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion. I was soaring ever higher But I flew too high. Though my eyes could see I-	[]
Stan	6	0	Dad? Dad! What are you doing?!	[]
Randy	21	0	I can actually play a lot of these songs on a real guitar. You want me to teach you boys how?	[]
Cartman	6	1	Uhh, that's gay, Mr. Marsh.	['gay']

Randy	5	0	But... But this is real.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Real guitars are for old people.	[]

Stan	2	0	Hang on.	[]
Man	2	0	Stan Marsh?	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah?	[]
Man	21	0	I'm Charles Kincade, from the Kincade Talent Agency? I just heard you broke a hundred thousand points on Guitar Hero.	[]
Stan	3	0	Yeah, we did.	[]
Mr. Kincade	11	0	I'm impressed.  And I'd like to be your manager.	[]
Stan	12	0	Wow, really??  Dude! Dude, Kyle, this guy wants to be our manager!	[]
Randy	2	0	No way!	[]
Kyle	2	0	For reals?	[]
Mr. Kincade	23	0	Scoring a hundred thousand points is amazing, but I think with the right label behind you, you guys could make a million points.	[]
Stan	4	0	That'd be awesome!	[]
Mr. Kincade	6	0	So, we're in business then?	[]
Mr. Kincade	5	0	Well, what do you think?	[]
Producer	8	0	I like it. That's these boys playing?	[]
Mr. Kincade	21	0	No, that's Kansas. But these boys scored a hundred thousand points to it on Expert Level in Co-op Mode.	[]
Producer	15	1	That's pretty Goddamned impressive.  Alright, we'll sign them to a one-year deal.	['goddamned']
Mr. Kincade	5	0	Yes! You did it, boys.	[]
Producer	25	0	Listen, boys, I'm having a huge celebrity party at my giant mansion tonight. Why don't you come by as my honorary new artists?	[]
"Stan, Kyle"	1	0	Cool!	[]
Stan	6	0	Wow, this is a huge party.	[]
Producer	10	0	Oh yes, all the biggest stars in Colorado are here.	[]
Stan	10	0	Dude, dude, that's Ron Zappolo from Channel 4 News!	[]
Kyle	17	0	Wow! Oh, and look over there, that's that Jake Jabs guy from American Furniture Warehouse commercials.	[]
Producer	30	1	Everyone? Everyone, this is Stan and Kyle. They just broke a hundred thousand points on Guitar Hero.  Please enjoy yourselves, there's lots more coke and sex in the house.	['sex']
Stan	13	0	Dude! Dude, that's Jay Cutler over there!  Quarterback for the Denver Broncos!	[]
Kyle	3	0	Oh my God!	[]
Producer	7	0	Would you boys like to meet him?	[]
Stan	3	0	Are you serious??	[]
Producer	18	0	Jay, I want you to meet Stan and Kyle. They broke a hundred thousand points on Guitar Hero.	[]
Jay	7	0	Wow, really? Nice to meet you guys.	[]
Stan	19	0	Nice to meet you!  I mean, you kind of suck, but my dad says you might be good someday.	[]
Jay	1	0	Thanks...	[]
Guest	7	0	Alex, have you seen my wife anywhere?	[]
Producer	12	0	You boys know Tom Shane from the Shane Company Diamond Store commercials?	[]
Kyle	6	0	Do we? He's a legend!	[]
Producer	21	0	You remember these boys, Tom. They're gonna break a million points live at the video arcade in a few weeks.	[]
Tom Shane	4	0	That, would be impressive.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Dude, we've arrived. We're super, awesome, and cool.	[]
Stan	12	0	Yeah. Life is finally going to not suck so hard for us.	[]
M.C.	2	0	You Rock!	[]
Mr. Kincade	5	0	All right, nice rehearsal, boys.	[]
Kyle	12	0	D-ude, I totally miffed that middle part. Did you see that?	[]
Stan	6	0	Yeah dude, that's almost impossible.	[]
Mr. Kincade	35	0	That was real cool, kids. Hey, Kyle, there's a different controller in my car that might work better for you. Why don't you go with Jim and he'll help you find it.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Oh, okay. Cool.	[]
Mr. Kincade	15	0	You've got real potential, kid. I have no doubt you can break a million.	[]
Stan	5	0	Really? That'd be sweet.	[]
Mr. Kincade	21	0	I think you could. But uh, as for your friend, well, to be honest, I think he's holding you back.	[]
Stan	4	0	What, you mean, Kyle?	[]
Mr. Kincade	38	0	Look, you score a lot higher than him; there's no question who the better one is. I wanna put you with some other players, find a partner for you who can really help you max your score.	[]
Stan	15	0	But, Kyle and I always play together. We both chipped in for the game system.	[]
Mr. Kincade	64	0	Very honorable. But you know where loyalty gets you in a game like Guitar Hero? Nowheres. Just listen to that video crowd.  I haven't heard a video crowd go that wild in a long time. You've got a chance to score a million points, and I hate to see you throw it away because you're worried about your friend's feelings.	[]
Mr. Kincade	33	0	You're gonna love this kid, Stan. He's one of the best Guitar Hero players I've ever seen. Except for you, of course.  Ah, Thad!  Stan Marsh, this is Thad Jarvis.	[]
Thad	1	0	Sup?	[]
Mr. Kincade	18	0	That here has backed up a lot of really great Guitar Hero players. Isn't that right, Thad?	[]
Thad	1	0	Yup.	[]
Mr. Kincade	17	0	He doesn't even need a game system to play on. He can play Guitar Hero acoustically.	[]
Stan	9	0	Yeah, but can he play Buckethead on Expert Level?	[]
Mr. Kincade	16	1	Go ahead, Thad. Show him what you can do.  Check this out.  Pretty damn good, huh?	['damn']
Stan	12	0	Yeah, that's pretty good. But can you play John the Fisherman?	[]
Mr. Kincade	13	0	Stan, with this kid backing you, you're gonna make Guitar Hero history.	[]
Male Diner	5	0	Ohoh, I love this song.	[]
Butters	6	0	Wow wee, look at him go!	[]
Kyle	5	0	Hey dude, how'd it-?	[]
Stan	7	0	...Kyle. ...I, I thought you were sick.	[]
Butters	2	0	Uh ohhh.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Who is this?	[]
Stan	5	0	This is um, Thad Jarvis.	[]
Thad	1	0	Sup?	[]
Kyle	7	0	Ahem, wha? What's going on, Stan?	[]
Stan	18	0	Kyle, I was gonna tell you later. Mr. Kincaid thinks I should play with Thad for a while.	[]
Kyle	9	0	But it's our game. We bought it together.	[]
Stan	19	0	I know, and, and I wanna be fair about it, so, I'll buy you out of your part.	[]
Kyle	19	0	Buy me out?! What are you saying?! What makes you so high and mighty you can buy me out?!	[]
Stan	8	0	Don't put this all on me, Kyle!	[]
Cartman	7	0	Oh my God this is so awesome.	[]
Stan	18	0	You were the one that's been blowing off playing after midnight, not playing 'cause you were sick,-	[]
Kyle	4	0	I have been sick!	[]
Stan	20	0	Look, the point is I'm never gonna break a million points playing with you! You know that's true!	[]
Kyle	12	0	I guess I didn't realize it was just about the points.	[]
Craig	4	0	Dude, this game rules.	[]
Stan	7	0	Let's just do this, all right?	[]
Brett	17	0	Hey! You're the kid I sold the Guitar Hero game to. How are you likin' it?	[]
Stan	45	0	It's okay, I guess. But I need some game guides for it. My manager and producer set up this live thing at the video arcade where I'm supposed to break a million in front of everybody and I'm I'm stressing out.	[]
Brett	28	0	Yeah, Guitar Hero can be pretty stressful. But you know, maybe instead of a game guide, you should just buy another game to kind of ...ease the stress.	[]
Stan	1	0	Huh?	[]
Brett	7	1	Have you ever heard of...  Heroin Hero?	['heroin']
Stan	3	1	Hero-Heroin Hero?	['heroin']
Brett	28	1	Ihit's a way easier game. All you do is run around a magical forest and shoot simulated heroin. You could call it the ultimate first-person shooter.	['heroin']
Stan	7	0	And there's no score? No crowds?	[]
Brett	29	0	No man. All you do is run through the pretty forest and chase a big dragon. But you don't ever catch the dragon. You just... keep chasing it.	[]
The Dragon	16	0	Chase me. Come on. This way. Shoot up and then you can catch me. Come on.	[]
Stan	4	0	Dude, this is awesome.	[]
Producer	4	0	How are they coming?	[]
Mr. Kincade	16	0	No worries, Mr. Hart. They'll be ready for the big show in a few days	[]
Mr. Hart	13	0	They'd better be. I paid good money to rent this place out.	[]
Stan	2	0	Ugh. Damint.	[]
Thad	7	0	Dude, sup. Did you practice last night?	[]
Stan	30	0	Yeah, I practiced last night! Just shut up and play!  No no, you know what?! Screw this!  I'm not playing this song! Why did you pick this stupid song?!	[]
Mr. Kincade	11	0	Stan, it's the song we all agreed you would play.	[]
Stan	14	0	Yeah? Well I changed my mind! We're changing the song to Cheap Trick!	[]
Thad	7	1	No way. I hate that bubblegum crap.	['crap']
Stan	17	0	Yeah? Well you're not the leader, are you, Thad?! We play the music I wanna play!	[]
Mr. Kincade	7	0	Stan, why are you so grumpy-grouchy?	[]
Stan	13	0	We're playing what I want, and I'll select a different song!	[]
Thad	26	0	Yeah? Well how about this one? I quite.  I quit I quit I quit.  I quit I quit I quit. I quit. I quit I quit.	[]
Stan	23	0	You know what? That's great with me, Thad, 'cause I don't need you to break a million points! I never did!	[]
Mr. Kincade	7	0	Stan, what is the matter with you?	[]
Stan	19	1	I just wanna play alone, alright?! I can't concentrate with all these assholes riding me all the time!	['assholes']
Mr. Kincade	3	0	What is this?	[]
Stan	1	0	Man...	[]
Mr. Kincade	5	1	Are you playing Heroin Hero?	['heroin']
Stan	4	0	Just, just a little.	[]
Mr. Kincade	15	1	No!  Nobody plays Heroin Hero just a little! You know, you never catch the dragon!	['heroin']
Stan	8	0	I know, but it mellos me out, okay?!	[]
Mr. Kincade	22	0	You'd better pull your act together, because now you're gonna have to break a million points and unlock superstardom solo!	[]
Stan	2	0	No problem.	[]
Older Boy	8	0	Hey, beat it, kid! We wanna play now!	[]
Kyle	5	0	I'm not done yet.	[]
Younger Boy	20	0	Hey, I know you. You're Kyle Broflovski. Didn't you used to have your own Guitar Hero game system?	[]
Kyle	7	0	No. You're thinking of somebody else.	[]
Younger Boy	12	0	Yeah, sure. He's the kid that scored a hundred thousand points.	[]
Older Boy	7	0	How come you're playing here now?	[]
Kyle	16	0	Look, just go ahead and play, alright?  Leave me alone.  Can I get a Fresca, please?	[]
Mick	17	0	You're good at that game, Kid. Too good to be playing in a dump like this.	[]
Kyle	17	0	Yeah well, I can't really afford to play anymore anyway. I'm about out of quarters.	[]
Mick	32	0	Well look, maybe I can use some extra music playing to this thing on weekend nights. You come in, work around here a little and... maybe you can play it for free.	[]
Kyle	17	0	I appreciate what you're trying to do, Mick, but I ain't a charity case yet.	[]
Mick	23	0	Ehhh, charity case eh, I'm just trying to help out a kid who's a little... down on his luck is all.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Thanks, Mick.	[]
The Dragon	13	0	Catch me. Come on, catch me.  What's wrong? Follow me. Come on.	[]
Mr. Kincade	12	0	Marsh? Stan, you got-  Oh my God!  Get up, Stan! Wake up!	[]
Stan	3	0	Huh? What, uh?	[]
Mr. Kincade	13	0	You're going on in ten minutes! Everybody's coming to see you!	[]
Stan	6	0	The dragon. Where did it go?	[]
Mr. Kincade	10	1	You've gotta pull it together!  Pull it together, Goddammit!	['goddammit']
Mr. Kincade	18	0	Thank you for coming to Gamecraft Arcade to watch Stan Marsh break a million points and unlock superstardom.	[]
Token	2	0	Go Stan!	[]
Cartman	8	0	All right, Stan, you've got it, man!	[]
Token	2	0	Yeah, Stan!	[]
Craig	7	0	Dude, what's the matter with him?	[]
Butters	17	1	He's been up for three days straight playing Heroin Hero.  Come on, Stan! You got it!	['heroin']
Mr. Kincade	5	1	Goddamnit, he's a mess!	['goddamnit']
Craig	7	0	Oh man, I can't watch this.	[]
Mr. Kincade	11	0	What are you doing?! The video crowd is starting to boo!	[]
Cartman	9	0	Come on guys. Let's get out of here.	[]
Mr. Hart	14	0	The next time you bring me some talent, make sure they're talent-ed.	[]
Mr. Kincade	19	0	You blew it! You had it all and you blew it! Listen to that video crowd! They hate you!	[]
Brett	10	0	There he is! So, did you break a million yet?	[]
Stan	20	0	No, I didn't break a million points and unlock superstardom, all right? I'm done with that stupid game!	[]
Brett	18	0	Aw, come on. Once you start playing Guitar Hero, you can't stop till you reach the top.	[]
Stan	8	0	I just wanna find something else to play.	[]
Brett	19	0	Have you played...  Rehab Hero? You get chased by a big dragon, but you keep running away from it.	[]
Stan	11	0	I just want a nice, simple... driving game. How about that?	[]
Brett	3	0	Sssure kid. Sure.	[]
Radio Host	51	0	All right, that was the Splendifs. And now here's a hit you all remember. It's a song that two local fourth grade boys scored a hundred thousand points to on Guitar Hero.  Don't know whatever happened to those boys. I Guess... they're not playing the game anymore.	[]
Skid Row	36	0	Woke up to the sound of pouring rain The wind would whisper and I'd think of you And all the tears you cried, that called my name And when you needed me I came through	[]
Stan	11	0	Kyle, could I just talk to you for like five minutes?	[]
Kyle	5	0	What are you doing here?	[]
Stan	8	0	Please, ih ih, it won't take long.	[]
Kyle	12	1	Goddamnit. We're gonna take a short break. Be back in five.	['goddamnit']
Stan	15	0	I was listening to you for a while. Dude, you've gotten a lot better.	[]
Kyle	13	0	Oh, thank you! I was so eagerly awaiting your approval of my abilities!	[]
Stan	22	0	Look, Kyle, the game is still set up at my house and, maybe we could go try playing it again over there.	[]
Kyle	21	0	Oh, so the gallant knight now comes to rescue me from the bowels of mediocrity! Oh, thank you, your royal lordship!	[]
Stan	6	0	That isn't it at all.	[]
Kyle	24	0	You don't get it, Stan! I can play here all I want. I even get free Frescas. I don't need you anymore!	[]
Stan	46	1	I know. I need you.  I thought I was having a great time because I was getting signed by managers and, going to big sex and coke parties, but, then I realized, I was having fun because I was doing all that...  ...with my best friend.	['sex']
Kyle	7	0	It was pretty fun, wasn't it?	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Look, I doubt we could break a million together anyway.	[]
Stan	18	0	I don't care. I'd just like to play with you again. For the fun of it.	[]
Kyle	20	1	I don't really see the fun in...  ...not trying to kick that game's ass once and for all!	['ass']
Stan	4	0	What, you mean it?	[]
Kyle	19	0	I think we can do it, Stan. I've been close to a million a few times by myself.	[]
Stan	5	0	Then let's go, dude!	[]
Kyle	22	0	Oh wait. Wait, I'm supposed to play here.  Hey, Mick, w-would you mind if I stepped out for a sec?	[]
Mick	16	0	Go on, get out of here, kid. Who needs your wailin' and rockin' around here anyways?	[]
Kyle	2	0	Thanks, Mick!	[]
Stan	10	1	All right, dude, let's do this.  What the hell?	['hell']
Randy	2	0	Ahhh, Ahhhhhhh.	[]
The Dragon	12	0	Come on, come on. You almost got me. Catch me. Come on.	[]
Stan	7	1	Aw Goddammit! Dad, get off our Xbox!	['goddammit']
Randy	7	0	Hang on, I almost caught the dragon.	[]
The Dragon	5	0	Hehe, you almost caught me.	[]
Stan	9	0	No, me and Kyle are gonna play Guitar Hero!	[]
Randy	10	0	I can get him! Wait! Where's he going now?	[]
Stan	8	0	You don't ever catch the dragon, Dad!	[]
Randy	12	0	NOO! NOOO I SAID! I AM YOUR FATHER! PUT IT BACK ON!	[]
Stan	8	0	Mom, will you get Dad out of here?	[]
Cartman	3	0	Stop cheating, Craig!	[]
Craig	4	0	How was that cheating!	[]
Cartman	7	1	'Cause you tricked me, you black asshole!	['asshole']
Butters	7	0	Fellas! Fellas! They're gonna do it!	[]
