Satan	16	0	Halloween is a night for evil. It is time for me to take what is mine.	[]
Demon 1	6	0	What do you plan, Lord Satan?	[]
Satan	33	1	On Halloween we shall open the Gates of Hell, rise up to the earth, and we will rent out the entire W Hotel, for an awesome party, and invite a bunch of celebrities!	['hell']
Demon 2	7	0	How big a party are we talking?	[]
Satan	16	0	Have you seen those rich, spoiled, teenage girls who have massive Sweet 16 parties? That big.	[]
Demon 2	6	0	Satan, we can't possibly do-	[]
Satan	190	2	SILENCE!  Halloween is about me! And I deserve a par-ty! This... shall be MY Super Sweet 16!!  Minions of Hell! The time has come for us to rise! For my Super Sweet 16 Halloween party!!  I got Bacardi, and Ghetto One to sponsor the party, and I'm calling it  Hell On Earth 2006!  But now, heed my words: in order to get in to the party, you have to RSVP and get a blue wristband. Everyone is gonna try and get into this party, so if you don't get your wristband in advance, or you're not wearing that wristband at the door, you're NOT GETTING IN!!  And NOW know this: It's a costume party, so you have to wear a costume. BUT... nobody better show up as The Crow! I'm serious. Every costume party there's like fourteen guys come dressed like the Crow 'cause they wanna look hot and hook up. It's lame! If you come dressed as the Crow, you're NOT GETTING IN to the party!!  Go now and prepare!! If you miss my party you are a looozer!!	['hell', 'hell']
