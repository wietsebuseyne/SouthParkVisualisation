Mr. Mackey	11	0	Well, I hope you learned that throwing rocks is bad, Eric.	[]
Cartman	37	0	Oh, I sure do, Mr. Mackey. I mean, I feel really bad, uhh. What was I thinking?  The only thing I can do now... is try to go on and live day by day.  See ya later.	[]

Mr. Mackey	24	0	Nn-um. m'kay, uh, I've already taken care of it; Eric Cartman here is gonna be punished with two weeks of detention.	[]
Agent Sharp	31	0	I'm afraid it's a bit more complicated than that, Mr. School Counselor.You see, since the victim in this case is African-American, this is considered  a hate crime.	[]
Cartman	7	1	...What the hell is a hate crime?	['hell']
Mr. Mackey	11	0	Uh, oh, but I don't think this is a ruh-	[]
Agent Keen	19	1	New laws have been passed that make any crime based on race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation a federal offense.	['sexual']
Cartman	4	0	What? A federal offense?	[]
Mr. Mackey	2	0	Oh no.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Oh no??	[]

Cartman	4	0	No! I hate hippies!	[]

Liane	2	0	Oo, poopiekins?	[]
Prosecutor	39	2	Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this is why we have hate-crime laws! This monster committed a crime-not against an individual, but against a race! Do the democratic thing and send his fat little butt to prison!	['fat', 'butt']

"Stan, Kyle"	2	0	We know!	[]
Stan	16	0	Dude, this is horrible. We gotta get Cartman out of court so we can go practice.	[]
Judge	28	0	Eric Cartman, you have been found guilty of committing a hate crime. For this, I hereby sentence you to the Alamosa Juvenile Hall, until you turn twenty-one.	[]

Judge	41	1	I am making an example of you, to send a message out to people everywhere: that if you want to hurt another human being, you'd better make damn sure they're the same color as you are!  Court is adjourned!	['damn']

Cartman	10	0	Kenny! Kenny, you have to get me out of town!	[]
Kenny	4	1	(What the fuck for?!)	['fuck']
Cartman	18	0	They're gonna put me in jail for a hate crime! You have to take me to Mexico!	[]
Kenny	15	0	(Mexico?! Why the heck do I have to take you all the way to Mexico?!)	[]

Anchor	43	0	A car chase is evolving on the 285 corridor east of South Park! Hate-crime suspect Eric Cartman is trying to outrun federal prosecutors in his friend's Go-Go Action Bronco! Our Eye in the Sky Greg Nimins is there live. Greg?	[]
Greg Nimins	78	0	Tom, it looks like the Go-Go Action Bronco is heading east on 285. Police officers are right behind him  but as with any chase, they're keeping a safe distance to avoid any accidents here out on the highway.  Tom, it looks like the fugitive is going to make a bold move off an exit off 285. He's going into a residential neighborhood now; this is where it could get dangerous, as there are pedestrians about.	[]
Cartman	9	1	Damnit, Kenny! Can't this thing go any faster?!	['damnit']
Kenny	7	0	(Why don'tcha keep your head down?!)	[]
Greg Nimins	23	0	Tom, the police have set a roadblock right where the Go-Go Action Bronco is heading.  This could be the final stand-off.	[]
Policeman 1	39	1	Alright, that's far enough. Stop the Go-Go Action Bronco and come out with your hands up.  Just bring it to a stop and come on out.  Jeezus, he's gonna ram it!  Crazy son of a bitch.	['bitch']
Greg Nimins	16	0	Well, it's been over thirteen hours now, and still the car chase has not ended.	[]
Kyle	6	1	What the hell are they doing?	['hell']
Greg Nimins	14	0	The chase has now moved through most of Arizona and nears the Mexican border.	[]
Stan	18	0	Dude, if Kenny takes Cartman to Mexico, how are we ever gonna win the sledding race on Saturday?	[]
Kyle	20	0	Don't worry, dude. That little truck just runs on D batteries. It's gonna run out of juice soon.	[]
Cartman	16	1	We're gonna make it, Kenny! We're gonna make it to Mexico!  Oh, God dammit!	['dammit']
Stan	1	0	Hello?	[]

Warden	42	0	Prisoner 24601, arriving.  Forward, prisoner! You will wake up each morning at 0500.  Lockdown is until 0900. At ten we begin random searches and checks for contraband.  At 11:30 we have naptime, followed by finger-painting. Your cellmate is Romper Stomper!	[]
Cartman	5	0	Huh-who's Romper Stomper?	[]
Romper Stomper	10	0	I am!  And I don't want no new cellmate!	[]
Warden	14	0	You don't have a choice, Stomper! Now, show this new prisoner the ropes!	[]
Romper Stomper	9	1	Oh, I will!  You bet your ass I will.	['ass']
Stan	35	0	Alright, guys. It looks like Cartman's not gonna be able to sled with us for another... 13 years, so in the meantime we need someone to race with us against the girls on Saturday.	[]
Kyle	20	0	Yeah. Cartman's weight was what gave us speed, so we need to find the next-fattest kid besides Cartman.	[]
Stan	11	0	Come on, who's the second-fattest kid in South Park?	[]
Butters	10	0	...Uuhh, I think Clyde is the next-fattest uh-kid.	[]
Clyde	1	0	Huh?	[]
Kyle	6	0	Yeah. Okay, get over here, Clyde.	[]
Clyde	4	1	I'm not fat.	['fat']

Kyle	9	2	Yeah, fatass! Get your fat butt on the sled!	['fat', 'butt']
Clyde	14	1	Hey, I'm not fat, you guys. I'm just kind of big-boned.	['fat']
Stan	10	0	Dah, that's what they all say. Okay, ready? Go!	[]

Stan	4	1	Nice going, fat boy!	['fat']
Romper Stomper	20	0	Well, well, well. New fish. How about you come up with a reason why we don't break your arms?!	[]
Inmates	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Cartman	14	0	Uh... 'Cause I'm just like you guys. Uh-I'm one of you.	[]
Romper Stomper	41	0	Oh yeah? The way I see it, there's two kinds of kids in the world: kids who like Animaniacs, and kids who don't like Animaniacs. You're either with us, or you're against us. So which are you?!	[]
Cartman	11	0	Oh, uh, well, personally, I... uhuhuhuh, I... don't like Animaniacs?	[]
Romper Stomper	3	0	...Neither do we	[]
Cartman	9	0	Oh, thank you, Jesus.  So we're friends now?	[]
Romper Stomper	25	0	No! There's no friends in the Big House! You come in with nobody and you leave with nobody. We don't believe in friends.	[]
Inmates	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Cartman	6	0	Yeah, neither do I. Friends suck.	[]
Romper Stomper	17	0	Now, go find me some cigarettes and I'll tell you how to bust out of here.	[]
Stan	38	0	Okay, we've figured it out. To add more weight to the sled, we're gonna use these bricks , but we're gonna cover 'em with kid's clothes so that the girls think it's another kid!	[]
Pip	6	0	Oh, that's a wonderful idea.	[]
Clyde	11	0	So I don't get to be on the team now?	[]
All the boys	3	0	Shut up, fatass!	[]
Kyle	16	2	Yeah, why don't you go eat some more pork rinds or something, you fat fuck?!	['fat', 'fuck']
Stan	8	0	Come on, let's get it a try.	[]
"Kenny, Stan"	1	0	Woopee!	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah-	[]
"Stan, Kenny, Kyle"	5	0	Wo-o-o-o-oh!	[]
Stan	3	0	Dude, bail! Bail!	[]
Kenny	5	0	(Huh? Uh.)  (AAAAAA!)  (Ufff!)  (Ugh!)	[]
Stan	6	0	Ooh, my God, we killed Kenny.	[]
Kyle	3	0	We killed Kenny?	[]
Stan	6	1	We Killed Kenny. We're bastards.	['bastards']
Kyle	10	0	Well, that didn't work. What else can we try?	[]
Stan	23	0	Nothing else is gonna work.  We have to face the fact that without Cartman we're gonna lose to a bunch o' girls.	[]
Butters	19	0	Well, uh-I sure do hate to, uh, to see my gender tuh, lose to a bunch o' women!	[]
Pip	8	0	This is a sad day for men everywhere.	[]
Stan	14	1	You know something, guys? I think we all took Cartman's ass for granted.	['ass']
All the boys	1	0	Yeup.	[]
Kyle	14	1	If only we had realized how special our time with his gigantic ass was.	['ass']
Butters	16	1	Well, all that time we didn't understand what a... unique and magical ass it was.	['ass']
Girl in Pink	18	0	Woohoo. Great time, girls.  Oh, gee. Looks like you lost another sledder. Good luck on Saturday, doughnut punchers!	[]
Stan	18	0	That does it! We've got no other choice! We've got to bust Cartman out of jail!	[]
Some boys	1	0	Oh?	[]
Other boys	1	0	Huh?	[]
Kyle	1	0	How?	[]
Stan	18	0	I saw a movie once where they baked a cake and put a nail file inside of it.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Sweet! Let's go!	[]

Cartman	6	1	Well, it sucks balls. Whattaya think?	['balls']
Stan	21	1	Cartman, why the hell did you have to commit a hate crime?! We're gonna lose to girls because of you!	['hell']

Stan	1	0	...Yeah.	[]
Cartman	13	0	Look, that's not important right now! Did you guys bring the cigarettes?	[]
Kyle	23	0	Well, we got some cigarettes, but we don't think you should be smoking. Each year, over a million people die of smo-	[]
Cartman	7	1	Just hand over the God-damned cigarettes!	['damned']
Stan	1	0	Sshh!	[]
Cartman	17	0	Look, if you guys want me back to win the sledding race,  then I need those cigarettes.	[]
Stan	9	0	How are we supposed to give them to you?	[]
Cartman	14	0	Just pass them through these little drill holes here. That's what everybody does.	[]
Stan	13	0	But they're gonna search you on your way back to your cell.	[]
Cartman	21	1	I know. That's why I have to have them up my ass.  Shut up, you guys! It's not funny!	['ass']
Stan	2	0	Alright, here.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Well, okay... here... l'see...	[]
Stan	12	0	Wow. I really wish I hadn't sat here and watched that.	[]

Cartman	13	0	Okay, guys, eh... If you'll excuse me, I must be going now.	[]
Kyle	13	1	Don't fart on your way out; you might make little smoke signals.	['fart']
Cartman	6	0	Hahah. Very funny, you guys, hahah.	[]
Stan	11	0	That sucks that we couldn't give him the nail file.	[]
Kyle	6	0	So now what do we do?	[]
Stan	33	0	There's only one thing we can do. We have to go see Token and see if he'll forgive Cartman for hate-criming him. Come on, we're running out of time!	[]
Romper Stomper	6	0	Well, did you get the cigarettes?	[]
Cartman	11	1	Yes. They are safely concealed in the depths of my ass.	['ass']
Romper Stomper	19	1	Alright. Go sit on the toilet and poop them out. I'll keep an eye out for the guards.	['poop']

Romper Stomper	3	0	You flushed them?!	[]
Cartman	26	1	Well, you spend eight years takin' a crap and then flushin' the toilet; it sorta becomes a reflex! Please, just help me bust out of here.	['crap']
Romper Stomper	29	1	No way, douche. I told you: I ain't your friend. If you want me to help you, you're gonna have to sneak something else in for me.	['douche']
Cartman	4	1	Son of a bitch!	['bitch']
Kyle	10	0	Dude, I didn't know Token lived so far away.	[]
Stan	17	0	Yeah. You know, they bus in people from different races to our school to promote cultural diversity.	[]
Kyle	8	0	Yeah. But isn't Token the only one?	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Linda Black	1	0	Hello?	[]
Stan	7	0	Hi. Can Token come out and play?	[]
Linda Black	16	0	Well, his head is still a little sore, but you can come in, if you like.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Killer.	[]
Stan	14	0	Token, you don't wanna see us guys lose to girls tomorrow, do you?	[]
Token	1	0	No.	[]
Kyle	22	1	Well then,  you've got to call the jail right now and tell them that you forgive Cartman for being a dumbass!	['dumbass']
Token	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Steve Black	9	0	I'm afraid it's not that simple, boys.	[]
Stan	3	0	It's not?	[]
Steve Black	17	0	No. You see, the only person that can let Eric out of Juvenile Hall is the governor.	[]
Kyle	8	3	Dammit! Son of a bitch, dammit!  Oh, sorry.	['dammit', 'bitch', 'dammit']
Steve Black	7	0	No, I'd, actually agree with you.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Huh?	[]
Steve Black	30	0	Yeah. I have a real problem.with hate-crime legislation. In fact, I'd love to see you kids go down and give the governor a piece of my mind.	[]
Stan	9	0	Well, why don't you tell the governor yourself?	[]
Steve Black	7	0	Oh, he wouldn't listen to me.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Why not?	[]
Steve Black	4	0	Because I'm black.	[]
"Stan, Kyle"	1	0	Oh.	[]
Steve Black	15	0	Sit down, boys. I'm gonna give you a little lesson about hate-crime laws.	[]
Cartman	14	1	Oh, thank God! Oh, thank you, Jesus, uh! Hoh.  Here you go, God-damnit!	['damnit']
Romper Stomper	12	0	Cool! My very own Tic-Tac-Throw game.  Ew, it smells, man.	[]
Cartman	22	1	Well, what the hell do you expect, huh?! Now I got your stupid game; tell me how to break out of here!	['hell']
Romper Stomper	16	1	You're not gonna break out of here! You're here 'til you're 21, douche!	['douche']
Cartman	3	0	But you said-	[]
Romper Stomper	20	1	I just wanted you to sneak stuff in for me. What? You actually think I give a crap about you?	['crap']
Cartman	3	0	I thought that-	[]
Romper Stomper	69	0	Hneah. You'd better wise up to the way things work in the big house.  Hey guys! I gots me a new Tic-Tac-Throw  Yeah, it's a little ripe, but it's brand new, man! You can play it at recess.  Hey. Uh, what are you doing?  You... you can't cry in prison, man. They'll bust your head open. What's the matter with you?!	[]
Cartman	5	0	I want my Mo-omm	[]
Romper Stomper	1	0	Dude.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Mommy, I want my Mommy!	[]
Romper Stomper	15	0	Look, if it's that important to you, I'll bust you out of here.	[]
Cartman	2	0	You will?	[]
Romper Stomper	25	0	Yeah. ...Yyeah, I will. Uh-but not because you're my friend. Only because... because I wanna bust out, too. Anh-anh, and see Disneyland.	[]
Aide	12	0	Governor, the Free Eric Cartman Now Committee is here to see you?	[]
Governor	15	0	Naw, not another committee. Send them in.  This is the Free Eric Cartman Now Committee?	[]
Token	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Governor	8	0	Well, boys, what can I do for you?	[]
Stan	5	0	Okay, go ahead and start.	[]
Kyle	6	0	I don't start, you start.	[]
Stan	43	0	Oh, uhyeah.  Hello, Mr. Governor, and thank you for taking the time to hear our presentation on hate-crime laws, entitled, Hate Crime Laws: A Savage Hypocrisy.  Yes, over the past few years our great country has been developing new hate crime laws.	[]
Token	22	0	If somebody kills somebody, it's a crime. But if someone kills somebody of a different color, it's a hate crime.	[]
Kyle	35	0	And we think that that is  a savage hypocrisy, because all crimes are hate crimes. If a man beats another man because that man was sleeping with his wife, is that not a hate crime?	[]
Stan	17	0	If a person vandalizes a government building, is it not because of his hate for the government?	[]
Token	10	0	And motivation for a crime shouldn't affect the sentencing.	[]
Stan	40	2	Mayor, it is time to stop splitting people into groups. All hate crimes do is support the idea that blacks are different from whites, that homosexuals need to be treated differently from non-homos, that we aren't the same.	['homosexuals', 'homos']
Kyle	44	0	But instead, we should all be treated the same, with the same laws and the same punishments for the same crimes . For in that way Cartman can be freed from prison, and we  will have a chance to win the sledding race on Thursday.	[]
Stan	9	0	That is our presentation. An idea that we call...	[]
Token	6	0	Hate Crime Laws: A Savage Hypocrisy.	[]
Governor	17	0	Hm. That made the most sense of any presentation I've heard in the last three years.	[]
Romper Stomper	11	0	Hurry up! They're sending the dogs after us!  Mph. Oowww!	[]
Cartman	4	0	What's the matter?	[]
Romper Stomper	15	0	It's my leg! I think it's broken.  You go on ahead without me.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Uhokay.	[]
Romper Stomper	14	0	Hey.  You're supposed to say, I'm not going without you, or something.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Oh. Really?	[]
Romper Stomper	17	0	Look, kid, you go on. You've got something to live out there. You've got friends.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Yeah. I never really realized that until just now.	[]
Romper Stomper	16	0	I sure would have liked to have seen Disneyland. Here. I want you to have these.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Okay.	[]
Romper Stomper	14	1	No! You're supposed to say, I can't take these, or something, dumbass!	['dumbass']
Cartman	6	0	Oh. I can't take these.	[]
Romper Stomper	14	0	Take them. They'll bring you luck.  Now go on. Get out of here.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Romper?	[]
Romper Stomper	1	0	Yeah?	[]
Cartman	23	0	You... well... I know you don't think you've... ever been anybody's friend, but, well, you're a friend to me.	[]
