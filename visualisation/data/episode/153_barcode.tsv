Editor	13	0	Being a delivery boy for the South Park Gazette is a noble privilege.	[]
Stan	30	0	I'm sorry, Mr. Jarvis, it's just that... I have to get up at 4 a.m. to deliver your paper and then I go to school all day.	[]
Mr. Jarvis	22	1	Oh waaa waaa waaa! We've all got problems, pussy! Get used to it!  You aren't delivering the papers on time!	['pussy']
Stan	19	0	My bike had a busted pedal, but I got it fixed, so there won't be a problem anymore.	[]
Mr. Jarvis	6	0	Is that your bike out there?	[]
Stan	2	0	Yeah. Why?	[]
Mr. Jarvis	5	0	'Cause it's being towed.	[]
Stan	1	0	What??	[]
Stan	6	0	Hey, hey! What are you doing?!	[]
Driver	3	0	This your bike?	[]
Stan	1	0	Yes!	[]
Driver	12	0	It's on the impound list. You owe the county for tickets.	[]
Stan	10	0	No-dude, I need my bike to do my job!	[]
Driver	18	0	Yeah? Well my job is to tow this bike. You want it back? You talk to the county.	[]
Stan	10	1	No NOO. Do NOT tow my bike!  Stop, asshole! RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!	['asshole']
Judge	3	0	Yes? Come in.	[]
Stan	16	0	Hi, my name is Stan Marsh. I was told to come down here and try to-	[]
Judge	26	0	Yes! Come on, Mr. Marsh. I've been told all about your case. Impounded bicycle, $83 owed to the county. Maybe you should get a job.	[]
Stan	20	0	I got a job, but without my bike to do my paper route, I can't make the money! See?	[]
Judge	42	0	Stan Marsh is a bright young man. He's got a great family, a promising paper route; only problem is,  his bike's been impounded!  But now, he's about to find out that getting his bike back isn't so easy.	[]
Stan	6	0	Look, I really need my bike.	[]
Judge	18	0	Well, I'm afraid I can't give it to you, because then you wouldn't learn anything..	[]
Stan	10	0	What do I have to learn?! This isn't fair!	[]
Judge	41	0	Whoa whoa, hold on. I've looked your case over and I think maybe we can cut a little deal here. According to your background check, when you were in kindergarten, you played on the Park County Pee Wee Hockey Team.	[]
Stan	1	0	...Yeah?	[]
Judge	16	0	Well it just so happens that the pee wee hockey team this year needs a coach.	[]
Stan	1	0	Me?	[]
Judge	44	0	Stan Marsh is a washed-up fourth grader. He's got no job, no bicycle. And his only way out is to coach...  a pee wee hockey team!  And now, he's about to find out that to coach, you've got to grow.	[]
Stan	28	0	Oh boy. Uh, all right, guys, over here? Come over here.  We've got a lot of work to do and not much time to do it in.	[]
Stan	24	0	My name is Stan and I'm your new coach. Now we just need to kind of organize a little bit and practice our-	[]
Stan	5	0	All right, fine, go ahead.	[]
Stan	6	0	S- hold it a while, okay?	[]
Stan	8	0	When you shoot the puck to another player.	[]
Stan	19	0	All right, all right, shut up! We're gonna practice! You two guys play defense, and you play goalie.	[]
Stan	2	0	Why not?!	[]
Stan	6	0	What, you got asthma or something?	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Stan	7	0	Ah, it's okay. Don't cry.	[]
Stan	6	0	Oh Jesus, can we just practice?	[]
Stan	1	0	NO!	[]
Coach	11	0	Well well well! If it isn't the Park County Losers!	[]
Coach	22	0	We just thought we'd come check out the ice for the game tomorrow.  Gavin Throttle, coach of the Adams County team.	[]
Stan	1	0	Hey.	[]
Gavin	20	0	Look, why don't you just give up? You can't beat us. You really want to embarrass your players?	[]
Park County	1	0	Yeah!!	[]
Gavin	15	0	Fine, if that's the way you want it. See ya tomorrow, coach! Adams Team!	[]
Adams County	2	0	Right! Follow!	[]
Stan	2	0	Jesus Christ.	[]
Sharon	9	0	Stanley, where have you been?! It's almost bedtime!	[]
Randy	12	0	Your mother's been worried sick, and I've been watching TV!	[]
Stan	19	0	I got a new job. I'm finally gonna be able to pay off all the money I owe.	[]
Randy	5	0	Oh, well that's good.	[]
Sharon	4	0	What kind of job?	[]
Stan	9	0	I'm working with the Pee Wee Hockey League.	[]
Randy	16	0	...What? With the-?  What whoa wait, Stan. You gave up playing hockey a long time ago.	[]
Stan	7	0	I'm not playing, I'm coaching.	[]
Randy	19	0	Have you forgotten what happened all those years ago? Or are you just trying to make up for it?	[]
Stan	5	0	What are you talking about?	[]
Randy	15	0	Your Pee Wee hockey game! The Pepsi Center?! In between periods of the Colorado Avalanche?	[]
Stan	7	0	I remember going to Shakey's afterwards.	[]
Randy	14	0	Stan, you can't put your family through this again! Whatever your reasons are!	[]
Stan	8	0	I'm tired. I'm goin' to bed.	[]
Randy	7	0	What are we goin' to do, Sharon??	[]
Sharon	1	0	What?	[]
Randy	27	0	Don't you get it? He's getting back into hockey to prove something to himself. So he can forget what happened in that Pee Wee skirmish.	[]
Sharon	9	0	Maybe he doesn't remember. He was only 4.	[]
Randy	13	0	Oho, he remembers. I'm sure it eats at him every single day.	[]
Announcer	34	0	And we're about out of time here in another scoreless Pee Wee hockey game.  And that's # 7, Stan Marsh, skating towards the goal, sort of, but h doesn't have the puck.	[]
Denver Goalie	8	2	I crapped 'em! Oh me I crapped 'em!	['crapped', 'crapped']
Announcer	24	0	Oh, it appears the goalie has pooped his pants.  Oh and look at this! Little Stan Marsh actually has a shot at the goal!	[]
Crowd	1	0	Ohhhh!	[]
Randy	3	0	Stan?? Shoot it!	[]
Announcer	11	0	Time is running out. Stan Marsh with a chance to win!	[]
Kyle	4	0	You got it, Stan!	[]
Randy	7	0	Take the shot!! Take the shot!!  NOOOOOOOOOOO!	[]
Announcer	10	0	Ohoooo, that's the end of the game! How disappointing.	[]
Sharon	4	0	Randy, what's wrong??	[]
Randy	17	0	OH! Ohh... Oh Sharon, it was horrible! It was like I was living it all over again.	[]
Stan	18	0	All right, guys. Tonight is our big game against Adams County. We still have all day to practice.	[]
A Man	9	0	Coach? Hey coach.  Could we talk to you, please?	[]
Woman	7	0	We are the Browns. Nelson's parents?	[]
Stan	1	0	Oh	[]
Mr. Brown	22	0	Our little Nelson, he's... taken a turn for the worse, I'm afraid! His cancer is... real ba-a-a-ad.	[]
Stan	1	0	Ohhh.	[]
Mr. Brown	44	0	Yeah. Oh. Doctors say this could be it. How am I supposed to do it, coach? How do I look a five year old child in the eye and tell him he's not gonna live?  You tell me, coach! You tell me how!!	[]
Mrs. Brown	14	0	Stop it, Jack! He doesn't mean to take it out on you, coach.	[]
Mr. Brown	39	0	No, I don't mean to take it out on you, coach. It's just...  I don't know what to say to him, coach. Neither of us do. What do you say tuh... somebody who's dying, huh?	[]
Stan	4	0	... I don't know.	[]
Mr. Brown	11	0	Will you talk to him, coach? He looks up to you.	[]
Stan	5	0	No, I think you oughta.	[]
Mr. Brown	18	0	Nah, I'm just his father. But you're his coach! You're like a father to him.	[]
Mrs. Brown	9	0	Please, coach, he's...  he's counting on you!	[]
Mr. Brown	7	0	Please, coach, he's counting on you!	[]
Stan	4	0	Oh uh, hey Nelson.	[]
Nelson	3	0	Oh.  Hi, coach.	[]
Stan	13	0	Dude, I can come back later. Is this a bad time for you?	[]
Nelson	26	0	Yeah, it's a pretty bad time for me, coach. I'm only five and I'm dying.  Coach, what's it like when you die?	[]
Stan	20	0	Wugh, I'm not sure. I would... think that... it's a lot like it was before you were born?	[]
Nelson	7	0	How come I have to die now?	[]
Stan	1	0	Ogh.	[]
Nelson	11	0	I mean, how come I don't get to grow up?	[]
Stan	6	1	Goddammit, dude, I don't know.	['goddammit']
Nelson	3	0	I'm sorry.	[]
Stan	38	0	No, what I mean is, nobody really knows, see? But everyone does it. I mean, it's not like everyone else gets to live and only you have to die. Everyone's gonna die. You feel better now?	[]
Nelson	3	0	I think so.	[]
Stan	17	0	Okay, great. Look, I, I gotta get to the stadium, but uh... hang in there? All right?	[]
Nelson	29	0	Thanks, coach.  Will you do me just one favor, Coach? That game tonight? I'm gonna be watching, so... could you... make it so I don't have cancer?	[]
Stan	10	0	No- dude, I told you I can't do that.	[]
Nelson	8	0	Well then, will you just... win for me?	[]
Stan	1	0	Okay.	[]
Judge	31	0	Stan Marsh has always lived a carefree life. But in the blink of an eye, what seemed important before can all be put in perspective. Stan Marsh is... Bummin' on Cancer.	[]
Announcer	14	0	Welcome, parents, to this Pee Wee hockey match between Park County and Adams County.	[]
Adams County	17	0	Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win!	[]
Stan	9	0	Coach, can I talk to you for a second?	[]
Gavin	4	0	Come to surrender, coach?	[]
Stan	32	0	Look, there's a kid in my team who's got cancer, and, he wants us to win this game really bad, so, could you just... give us kind of a break?	[]
Gavin	22	0	HA! I don't think so, Coach. We're gonna beat you into the ground, cancer or no!  Win! Win! Win! Win!	[]
Adams County	6	0	Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! ...	[]
Stan	27	0	All right, guys, listen.  I saw Nelson in the hospital, and he asked me one thing: he said he wanted us to win this game... for him.	[]
Stan	10	0	Relax! If we lose we're not gonna be murderers.	[]
Gavin	13	0	Good luck, Coach! You're gonna need it!  Yeah! Let's go Adams!	[]
Stan	6	0	Let's go, Park! Come on!	[]
Gavin	6	0	That's it, Brian! Kill him!	[]
Stan	4	0	Get near the puck!	[]
Announcer	13	0	And that's the end of the game. The result is a tie.	[]
Stan	6	0	Tie? Well, what does that mean?	[]
Judge	37	0	Stan Marsh was supposed to win it all. The big game. A dying boy's hope. Only problem is,  he tied!  And now, he's about to find out that tying isn't the same as winning.	[]
Stan	1	0	Hello?	[]
Nelson	1	0	Coach.	[]
Stan	4	0	How are you feeling?	[]
Nelson	13	0	I feel pretty good, except for the cancer.  Coach? Does God hate me?	[]
Dr. Doctor	3	0	Oh, hello Coach.	[]
Stan	7	0	Uh, hi Doc. How's he doing?	[]
Dr. Doctor	20	0	Well, he isn't worse, but, he isn't getting better. It's almost as if... his cancer were tied.	[]
Stan	2	0	Oh boy.	[]
Nelson	4	0	Oh. My cancer hurts.	[]
Dr. Doctor	25	0	He seems to have put all his hope into you winning that game. And with a tie, he's in a kind of... cancer limbo.	[]
Stan	5	0	But what can I do?	[]
Judge	23	0	Stan Marsh! Stan Marsh! Great news! Our hockey team has just been invited to play against Denver County during a Colorado Avalanche game!	[]
Nelson	5	0	Wow.  At the Pepsi Center?	[]
Dr. Doctor	6	0	Look! He's coming around again.	[]
Nelson	13	0	That's our biggest game ever. Do you think we can win, Coach?	[]
Stan	4	0	Well, ah, I mean...	[]
Judge	38	0	Imagine. If there was one game, one chance, to make everything right. Stan Marsh is being given that chance. But to win, he's gonna have to pull out all the stops in... Stanley's Cup! Rated R.	[]
Stan	6	0	Yeah... yeah, we'll beat 'em.	[]
Nelson	8	0	All right! Maybe there IS hope for me.	[]
Dr. Doctor	29	0	Just be aware of this, Coach. If you lose the Big Game, that little boy is going to die faster than Steve Irwin in a tank full of stingrays.	[]
Stan	4	0	Well, sure we can.	[]
Stan	16	0	Look, guys. I believe in you. Nelson believes in you. Doesn't that count for anything?	[]
Stan	6	0	They're not gonna kill us.	[]
Stan	24	0	Haven't you guys ever seen these movies? We're just supposed to rally together, believe in ourselves, and we win in the end.	[]
Stan	8	0	Hey that's right. We need a ringer.	[]
Park County	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Kyle	17	0	Stan, I told you. My mom doesn't want Ike playing hockey. She thinks it's dangerous.	[]
Stan	13	0	It's just for one game. He won't get hurt, I promise.	[]
Park County	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Kyle	26	0	All right, but it's gonna take more than one good player to beat the champions, Stan. You'd better have a really good game plan.	[]
Randy	30	0	Can you believe it, Stan? The Pepsi Center. You're going back to the place where it all happened. Same place where you missed that shot all those years ago.	[]
Stan	10	0	Dad, I'm working on my game plan right now.	[]
Randy	87	0	Ya have to understand why I can't go. I can't... sit there in that same crowd and watch you destroy yourself again.  Oh, Stan. Of all the places, why does it have to be the Pepsi Center? All right, all right, I'll go. No, no I WANT to go.  I'm gonna be there for you and... I'll be rooting louder than anybody, saying That's my son!  And just remember, Stan: win or lose. Those are your two options, Win, or lose.	[]
Announcer	47	0	His shot is blocked! What a great save!  And that's the end of the second period. The score is tied 2-all.  And now please put your hands together for three minutes of exhibition play from some of our state's finest Pee Wee hockey players.	[]
Stan	67	0	All right, you guys, this is it. The moment is here. We've been through a lot together, and according to every movie ever made, we're going to win this game. Just don't forget: there's a little boy in the hospital who's really counting on us. So let's not let him down. Are you with me?!  All right, let's go win!	[]
Official	7	0	Sorry boys, you aren't playing tonight.	[]
Stan	1	0	Huh?	[]

Official	13	0	Well, you've got nobody to play, there's nothing we can do.	[]
Stan	9	0	But it isn't supposed to end like this!	[]
Av 1	21	0	Hey, hold on a second. If these kids have been through a lot of emotional changes, then they have to play.	[]
Av 2	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Official	6	0	Well, who are they gonna play?	[]
Av 1	5	0	They can take our place.	[]
Av 3	7	0	Yeah. Let 'em play the Red Wings.	[]
Stan	4	0	Play the Red Wings?	[]
Judge	32	0	Stan Marsh coaches a Pee Wee hockey team. But now  they're going to play in the big leagues.  They've got small bodies but big hearts. Stan Marsh is... going professional.	[]
Av 1	6	1	All right! Give 'em hell, boys!	['hell']
The Avs	3	0	All right! Yeah!	[]
Announcer	40	0	It's a tie game here in Colorado as we get set to start the final period. Your attention, please: for this third and final period, the Detroit Red Wings will be playing... the Park County Pee Wee Hockey Team.	[]
