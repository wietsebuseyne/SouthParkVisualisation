Announcer 1	45	0	Since the last South Park, you've waited four long weeks to find out who the father of Eric Cartman is. Now, finally, the shocking truth about Cartman's lineage... will not be seen tonight, so that we can bring you the following special presentation.	[]
Announcer 2	28	1	Now, get ready for Canada's hottest action stars,  Terrance and Phillip in HBC's Movie of the Week:  Not Without My Anus. Based on a true story.	['anus']
Scott	49	0	Ladies and gentlemen, the case before you today is of a murderer. On the night in question, this monster entered the home of Dr. Jeffrey O'Dwyer and struck him repeatedly on the head with his hammer.  That monster is sitting right over there, and his name is Terrance!	[]
Phillip	6	1	Oh, Terrance! You farted in court!	['farted']
Terrance	10	0	Yes, Phillip. I'm making a case for our defense.	[]
Scott	73	0	All of these things link Terrance to the murder: hair fibers, blood samples, nail clippings, a piece of his shirt,  a watch with his initials on it, a day planner with the murder scheduled, a haiku called, Time to Kill Dr. Jeffrey O'Dwyer. Dr. O'Dwyer Time to have your head smashed in with my new hammer Terrance, you may be a famous surgeon, but you're not God! J'accuse, Terrance!	[]
Terrance	7	0	Would you like a monkey claw, Phillip?	[]
Phillip	2	0	Yes, please.	[]
Terrance	20	0	That's called a monkey claw because it feels like my colon is being ripped apart by a thousand monkeys!	[]
Phillip	5	0	The monkey claw is smelly.	[]
Judge	14	0	Come on, get a move on. I ain't gettin' any younger up here.	[]
Phillip	15	0	My sentiments exactly, Your Honor. I see from your actions that you're southern Canadian.	[]
Judge	3	0	That is correct.	[]
Phillip	12	0	Good people of the jury. My client, Terrance, is an innocent man.	[]
Terrance	9	1	Oh, Phillip, now you farted during the closing argument!	['farted']
Phillip	6	0	I have, haven't I, Terrance?	[]
Scott	23	1	Your Honor, the defense is trying to make a mockery of this court! They think that farts are funny, but they're not!	['farts']
Judge	1	0	Sustained.	[]
Phillip	56	0	Good people of the jury. My client, Terrance, is no more a murderer than you or me. He loves puppies and hates mean things. Would a murderer go to the zoo and feed animals like this?  Of course not. So in summation, find Terrance innocent. Or else he'll kill you.  Just kidding.  The defense rests!	[]
Scott	5	1	Goddammit. That isn't funny!	['goddammit']
Judge	15	1	Madame Foreperson, have you reached a verdict so we can get the hell outta here?!	['hell']
Madame Foreperson	20	0	We have, Your Honor. We have found Terrance, in the above entitled action of murder against Dr. Jeffrey O'Dwyer--	[]
Judge	14	0	You're gonna have to repeat that verdict because we have some flatulence issues.	[]
Madame Foreperson	9	0	I said, we find--  We find Terrance--  Not guilty!	[]
Phillip	9	0	Did you hear that, Terrance? You're not guilty!	[]

Phillip	2	0	Hear hear!	[]
Scott	11	0	Well, looks like you got away with it, Terrance and Phillip!	[]
Phillip	9	0	Oh, hello, Scott. No hard feelings, right, old pal?	[]
Scott	29	0	There are hard feelings! This isn't over! I'm going ta see to it that you both pay for what you've done! And do you know why??	[]
Phillip	5	1	'Cause you're a dick?	['dick']
Scott	50	2	No! Because I hate you! You think farting is sooo funny! Well it isn't!! Fart jokes are the lowest form of comedy, and if I--  Ugh! I hate you both! I've hated you ever since I could remember! I hate you, and I wish you both had cancer!	['farting', 'fart']

Terrance	6	1	But we're not gay, Phillip.	['gay']
Phillip	3	0	We're not?	[]
Terrance	15	0	Well, let us board the subway and return home. There we can eat Kraft Dinner!	[]
Phillip	15	0	Yes. It's been a long day, and only Kraft dinner can calm my nerves.	[]
Terrance	17	0	Say, Phillip, why does Scott always try to convict me of murder? He does it every week.	[]
Phillip	16	0	He sure does seem to hate us. I wonder what he'll try to do next.	[]
Terrance	3	0	God only knows.	[]
Phillip	6	0	The subway certainly is wonderful, Terrance.	[]
Terrance	8	0	It sure is. Let's look for treasure.	[]

Scott	9	0	Yes. I'm a television critic for a magazine.	[]
Voice	8	0	I understand that you hate Terrance and Phillip.	[]
Scott	19	1	Yes! Yes I do! They think that fart jokes are a sophisticated form of comedy, but they're not!	['fart']
Voice	14	0	Well, what about I help you get rid of them once and for all?	[]
Scott	3	0	Who is this?	[]
Voice	24	0	Let's just say that I'm someone who can help you, if you help me.  Just call me your old pal, Saddam Hussein.	[]
Scott	5	0	Saddam Hussein?! The Iraqi dictator?	[]
Saddam	12	0	Eeeeeeyy, relax guy! I'm just your average Joe. Take a rest!	[]
Scott	4	0	What do you want?	[]
Saddam	33	0	You want Terrance and Phillip out of Canada, I want you to bring me and my friends into Canada. That sounds like a fair trade, doesn't it? Super! Let's get started.	[]

Ugly Bob	3	0	I know, but--	[]
Phillip	17	0	Ugly Bob, your face looks like somebody tried to put out a forest fire with a screwdriver.	[]
Ugly Bob	24	0	I can't help how I look. Besides, it's not what on the outside that matters, it's what's on the inside.	[]
Terrance	13	0	No it isn't.  Wanna see what's on the inside of me?	[]
Phillip	20	0	Wait wait. I've got an idea. Why don't you put this paper bag over your head, Ugly Bob?	[]
Terrance	17	0	Yes.  If people can't see your face, they won't know how wretchedly ugly you are.	[]
Ugly Bob	12	0	Really? Hey, thanks, you guys. Maybe now I can score with chicks.	[]

Celine Dion	11	0	What do you mean? Why are you calling him Ugly Bob?	[]
Phillip	8	1	Because that's his name, you stupid bitch!	['bitch']
Celine Dion	8	0	You told me your name was Handsome Bob!!	[]

Scott	16	0	...No I don't need a rest!! I want to know what this is all aboot!	[]
Saddam	36	0	Hey, relax, fella. I'm just making it so that Terrance and Phillip can never come back to Canada again. I just need a couple of days, and then I'm gonna head back to Iran.	[]

Terrance	16	0	Hey, Phillip. Isn't that the smelly gentleman we've seen in pictures all over town?	[]
Phillip	15	0	Yes it is, Terrance. According to that newsie, he's some kind of Turkish dictator.	[]
Terrance	19	0	Well, we just can't sit here and eat Kraft Dinner and let Canada be overrun by the Turks!	[]

Scott	1	1	Goddammit!	['goddammit']
Terrance	5	0	Oh, wait a second, Scott.	[]
Scott	28	0	Sure.  I mean, no! You listen to me! If you want to save Canada, you'll meet me at Karl's Kroff Dinner Restaurant in half an hour!	[]
Celine Dion	17	0	Oh, Ugly Bob, I'm so confused. I love your personality, but you are so wretchedly ugly.	[]
Ugly Bob	10	0	Maybe the baby will have your face instead of mine.	[]
Celine Dion	23	0	We can only hope. I suppose we'll be okay as long as you keep that bag on your head.  What's this?!	[]
Saddam	25	0	He-yy there. I'm Saddam Hussein. I'm a big fan of Polo. I've been searching a long time for you, Celine Dion.	[]
Ugly Bob	9	1	Oh no, you don't. She's my bitch.	['bitch']
Saddam	4	0	Eh! Who are you?	[]
Ugly Bob	20	0	I'm Bob. But my friends call me Ugly Bob, because I have the features of a deformed burn victim.	[]
Saddam	24	0	Really? I thought all Canadians looked alike. Let me see.  Well, I'm sorry, guy. You know, I could cure that face of yours.	[]
Ugly Bob	2	0	You can?	[]
Saddam	38	0	Sure! I just need a favor. There is a Canadian football game tomorrow: the Ottawa Roughriders vs. the Vancouver Roughriders. It is at that game that I will officially turn the Canadian flag over to my Iranian one.	[]
Celine Dion	2	0	What?! Why?!	[]
Saddam	45	0	Hey! Don't worry about that. Take a load off, don't worry about it! Look over here! ...All I need is for Celine Dion to sing our Iranian national anthem at the game - to finalize my hostile takeover of Canada. What do you say?	[]
Ugly Bob	7	0	Did you say, hostile takeover of Canada?	[]
Saddam	5	0	No, no, relax there, fella!	[]
Terrance	13	0	Well, Scott said to meet him here, but he's not showing up!	[]
Phillip	12	0	Well, while we're waiting, why don't we search for treasure?	[]
Terrance	8	0	Oh. Good idea. Let's search for treasure.	[]
Scott	5	0	What are you idiots doing?!	[]
Terrance	5	0	We're looking for treasure!	[]
Scott	16	0	Is that some kind of metaphor for a kind of search that can't be described?	[]
Phillip	6	0	No, we're searching for treasure.	[]
Scott	19	0	Listen. I have an inside scoop. There's an Iraqi dictotor who is quietly and slowly taking over Canada.	[]
Terrance	11	0	Yes. You mean Saddam Smelly. We saw him on the telly.	[]
Scott	9	0	Well, what are you two gonna do aboat it?	[]
Phillip	4	0	What do you mean?	[]
Scott	24	0	It's your fault that he's here! You brought the Iraqis back with you on your plane when you rescued your kidnapped daughter!	[]
Phillip	6	0	You mean, we are to blame?!	[]
Scott	39	0	That's right. And now you must make amends. Tomorrow, Saddam will try to finalize his takeover of Canada, at the Roughriders-Roughriders football game. It will be your only shot at wiping them all out. Here, take this.	[]
Phillip	3	0	What is this?	[]
Scott	24	0	It's a bomb.  You must strap it to yourselves, go to the game, and sacrifice your lives to take out Saddam's minions.	[]
Terrance	4	0	That plan's scary!	[]
Scott	7	0	Well, you must do it for Canada.	[]
Phillip	3	0	For Canada, Terrance.	[]
Terrance	3	0	For Canada, Phillip.	[]
Scott	23	1	Yes, Terrance and Phillip. And when the dust is settled, Canada will be rid of both: the Iraqis and your immature fart humor.	['fart']
Terrance	13	0	Well. Phillip, I am very sad that we have to die for Canada.	[]
Phillip	22	0	Yes. This bomb will blow us both to smithereens. But we really have no choice. Only our deaths can bring Canada life.	[]
Terrance	3	0	That's funny!	[]
Phillip	9	1	Hey! Wait a minute. That fart gives me pause.	['fart']
Terrance	3	0	Why is that?	[]
Phillip	13	0	That smelly Saddam Hussein. He uses germ and chemical warfare, does he not?	[]
Terrance	4	0	Yes. Apparently, he does.	[]
Phillip	12	0	Terrance! Get the phone book! We must call every Canadian we can!	[]
Terrance	9	0	Oh, Phillip. It sounds like you have an idea.	[]
Phillip	3	0	I do, Terrance.	[]
Announcer	56	0	And the Roughriders are giving the Roughriders a run for their money!
