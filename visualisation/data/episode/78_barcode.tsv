Doctor	8	0	Alright, Ms. Sanders, all ready for your abortion?	[]
Ms. Sanders	10	0	Ready as I'm ever going to be, I guess.	[]
Doctor	11	0	Well, try to relax; It will all be over very soon.	[]
Ms. Sanders	7	0	Docter, can we turn off that television?	[]
Doctor	11	0	Oh yes, I 'm sorry. Now, there is one more thing.	[]
Ms. Sanders	1	0	What?	[]
Doctor	7	0	Have you heard of stem-cell research?	[]
Ms. Sanders	17	0	Uh-I've heard of it on the news, but... I don't know what it is.	[]
Doctor	56	0	Well basically, a lot of amazing studies have shown that stem cells might be used to fight cancer and a myriad of other diseases. Right now, a lot of stem cells come from the tissue of aborted fetuses-  ah- I'm sorry, unwanted children. And if you sign a release, that tissue can go to studies.	[]
Ms. Sanders	9	0	Oh well, I suppose, if it can help others.	[]
Doctor	7	0	The hope is that someday it might.	[]
Ms. Sanders	2	0	Well okay.	[]
Doctor	18	0	Great.  Well, here we go. Nurse?  This is to go to Alder's Labs for stem-cell research.	[]
Nurse	2	0	Yes, Doctor.	[]
Truck Driver	18	0	...going places that I've never been Seeing things that I may never see a- Uuugh!  Jesus Christ!!	[]
Cartman	18	0	My baby takes the morning train and she takes another home again. Hmm.  What do we have heah?	[]
Stan	6	0	Well that burned a long time.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Yeah, that was pretty good.	[]
Stan	5	0	Oh dude, there goes one.	[]
Kyle	2	0	'K go!	[]
"Stan, Kyle"	1	0	Alright!	[]
Kenny	3	0	(That's awesome)	[]
Kyle	10	0	You've had that cough a while, Kenny. You okay?	[]
Kenny	5	0	(All right. I'm fine.)	[]
Butters	5	0	Hehehey, fellas! Ah, hey fellas!	[]
Stan	2	0	What, Butters?	[]
Butters	10	0	Eric says you gotta come to his house right away.	[]
Stan	5	0	Tell him we're busy.	[]
Butters	23	0	Oh, ah, well, he knew you'd say that, so, he told me to tell you that you don't wanna miss this.	[]
Kyle	7	0	What, did he lose a hundred pounds?	[]
Butters	20	2	Yeah, he ah knew you'd say that, too, so he said t'say, uh, up your ass, Jew.  Yeah.	['ass', 'jew']
Stan	8	0	Alright, let's go see what he wants.	[]
Butters	5	0	Oh, it's all sticky.	[]
Kyle	18	1	Alright, Cartman! What's so important you had to pull us away from lighting cow crap on fire?!	['crap']
Cartman	9	0	Oh you guys, you're not gonna believe it!	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Cartman	9	0	Guess what I have sitting in my back yard?	[]
Kyle	2	0	A trampoline?	[]
Cartman	1	0	Better.	[]
Stan	2	0	A boat?	[]
Cartman	1	0	Better.	[]
Kenny	3	0	(A football machine?)	[]
Cartman	1	0	Better.	[]
Stan	3	0	Well WHAT, Cartman?	[]
Cartman	6	0	Thirty-three aborted fetuses.  Oh yes.	[]
Kyle	1	0	...What?	[]
Cartman	4	0	Mint condition, tax free.	[]
Stan	10	1	Cartman, what the hell are you doing with aborted fetuses?!	['hell']
Kyle	5	0	I'm leaving right now!	[]
Cartman	10	0	Oh, I guess you don't watch the news, Kyle!	[]
Kyle	18	1	You've never watched the news, fatass!  And what the hell does that have to do with anything?!	['hell']
Cartman	3	0	Stem cells, numbnuts!	[]
Stan	2	0	Stem cells?	[]
Kyle	9	0	Oh, and what do you know about stem cells?!	[]
Kenny	6	1	(What the fuck are stem cells?)	['fuck']
Kyle	19	0	They're cells that come from fetuses, and some research show that they could be used to treat diseases.	[]
Cartman	43	1	It's been proven, Jew! I saw it on 3-2-1 Contact. With all the research that's going on, stem cells are worth three times their weight in gold. What I have in my back yard is an aborted treasure chest.	['jew']
Kyle	5	0	...I hate you so much.	[]
Cartman	16	1	Fine! I don't need you assholes! I can sell these fetuses all on my own!	['assholes']
Cartman	266	8	Hello. Is this the University of Colorado Biology Department? ...Great, uh I understand you're currently doing research on stem cells? Kewl, because I'm currently in possession of some aborted fetuses that I'm looking to unload? ...Uh, how much do you pay? ...No, no, come on, ah I got a guy who's gonna give me eighty dollars a pound right now. ...How about a hundred? ...Oh you're breaking my balls- I, I'll think about it. Bosnod Medical Group? ...Yeah, I called earlier about the stem cells and the fetuses? ...Okay, hi Randy, yeah. ...Oh yes, they've been kept in a cool temperature, yeah. ...These are primo fetuses, Randy, I wouldn't jerk you around. ...So what can your company give me for 'em? ...Oh Randy, you're breaking my balls here. ...You're breaking my balls, Randy.  Oh plehease! Okay, you tell me where you can get aborted fetuses for seventy cents on the dollar? You tell me, Chuck? ...Yeah, I didn't think so-You know, I'm just like the fetuses, Chuck. I wasn't born yesterday, either. Uh huh. ...So are you gonna talk to me, or are we just gonna keep bullshitting each other? Breakin' my balls, Chuck.  I gotta unload these fetuses, you wanna do some research. Are we talkin' here or what? You're breaking my balls. ...I'm telling you, if you let this deal pass you by, you're making a fetal mistake.  That's a joke  ...A hundred ten. ...Alright, alright, we got a deal. ...Good bye.  Damn I'm good.	['balls', 'jerk', 'balls', 'balls', 'bullshitting', 'balls', 'balls', 'damn']
Receptionist	4	0	Can I help you?	[]
Cartman	10	0	Yes, I'm making a delivery of these fetuses hyah?	[]
Receptionist	21	0	Oh, right, the fetuses. We were very lucky you called. Our last shipment of fetuses was lost in a truck accident.	[]
Cartman	13	0	Gee, that's terrible. So, uh who do I talk to about payment?	[]
Researcher	5	0	This is awful, just awful!	[]
Receptionist	11	0	Oh Larry! This young man has some new fetuses for research.	[]
Cartman	11	0	You're gonna love these fetuses, Larry. They're top notch.	[]
Larry	14	0	Oh well, I'm sorry, but we can't buy those from you now.	[]
Cartman	15	0	...What?! We made a deal, Larry! I brought them all the way down here already!	[]
Larry	14	0	I'm afraid the government has just put a ban on stem-cell research.	[]
Receptionist	3	0	A ban? Why?	[]
Larry	26	0	Too many people were upset about using aborted fetal tissue for a study. It's too bad, too. We really coulda helped a lot of people.	[]
Cartman	14	2	Ay! What the hell am I supposed to do with these things, huh?! Goddammit!	['hell', 'goddammit']
Stan	11	0	Dude, it looks like Cartman and Kenny are ditching school again.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Yeah, they're gonna get busted again.	[]
Ms. Choksondik	26	0	Alright, class, let's take our seats.  Now, uh, before we get started, Stan and Kyle? Uh, the principal needs to see you in her office.	[]
Stan	5	0	The principal? Aw, come on!	[]
Kyle	9	0	We don't know where Cartman is, Ms. Choksondik!	[]
Ms. Choksondik	6	0	She needs to see you now!	[]
Kyle	12	1	Aw man, here we go again! Use the Jew as a scapegoat.	['jew']
Principal Victoria	2	0	Hello, boys.	[]
Stan	6	0	Wait. What's going on here?	[]
Kyle	25	0	Alright, we don't know for sure why Cartman is ditching school, but it has something to do with abortion. That's all we know.	[]
Mr. Mackey	37	0	You didn't do anything wrong boys. We just need to talk to you. Have a seat.  Boys, uh... your little friend Kenny went to the hospital last night, m'kay.  And well, he's pretty sick.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Kenny's sick?	[]
Stan	3	0	Well how sick?	[]
Chef	9	0	Children, Kenny has been diagnosed with a... terminal disease.	[]
Stan	9	0	...but... the doctors are gonna make him better, right?	[]
Sharon	2	0	Oh dear.	[]
Stan	13	0	Mom? That's what hospitals are for. They, they can make him better.	[]
Sharon	1	0	Randy...	[]
Randy	29	0	They don't think so, Stanley. Your... your friend is terminally ill, and that means.. Well son,... th- that means he's going to be going to heaven soon.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Wait. Kenny's going to die?	[]
Gerald	3	0	...He might, Kyle.	[]
Stan	7	0	...But... he's our... fu... fufu- friend.	[]
Mr. Mackey	27	0	We know, and that's why he's going to need you boys to be strong for him, m'kay? He needs you now more than ever.	[]
Stan	13	0	No! This can't happen! Kenny can't die! Kenny can't die!!	[]
Cartman	139	3	Come on, Jack, you gotta be able to offer me more than that. ...Yes, I realize there's a ban on stem-cell research, but I've got thirty-some-odd human fetuses in my backyard! I'm sure there's other research your company can do with them. ...You'll take one? Okay, how much for one? ...Aw, Jack, you're breaking my balls here, Jack. Yes, hello, is this Captain Bly's Seafood Restaurant? ...Yeah, hi, I've got a shipment of about thrity-one of the most succulent shrimp from the West Indies. ...These are killer shrimp, Gary, your customers are gonna love 'em. ...What kind of price you payin' for shrimp? ...Oh, Gary, you're breakin' my balls, Gary. How about ten and a quarter? ...Balls, Gary. Breakin' 'em. ...Alright, I'll call you back.	['balls', 'balls', 'balls']
Liane	10	0	Sweetie, your friends are downstairs. They need to see you.	[]
Cartman	18	0	Not now, Mom, I've only unloaded three feti; I've gotta sell the rest before they spoil.	[]
Liane	6	0	They say it's an emergency.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Buh, alright.  eh, Butters?	[]
Butters	2	0	Uh, yeah?	[]
Cartman	7	0	Are you through databasing the clientele sheet?	[]
Butters	3	0	Eh, just about.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Alright, well, you gotta take over the telemarketing for a bit.	[]
Butters	4	0	Oh. Well, uh okay.	[]
Cartman	17	0	Just remember what I taught you and follow protocol. Next number to try is on the list.	[]
Butters	60	3	Right.  Uh hello? Is this Mr. Thompson with Anatomy Research? ...Yes, uh, hello sir. Uh, aah, we have a surplus of unborn fetuses that we think you can use for a ...dissection study. Uh huh, ah, how much do you pay for that? ...You're breaking my balls. ...I said, you're breaking my balls, Mr. Thompson. ...My, my balls.	['balls', 'balls', 'balls']
Cartman	6	0	What is this, a PTA meeting?	[]
Kyle	6	0	Cartman.  Kenny's in the hospital.	[]
Cartman	4	0	In the ...hospital? Why?	[]
Kyle	18	0	They told us he has a m-muscular disease. An and, that ...and that he, he might die.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Die? Kenny?	[]
Stan	10	0	Don't you say that! Kenny's not gonna die!	[]
Sheila	22	0	I'm going to go take the boys to go see him at the hospital, Eric. We thought you might wanna come.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Yeah. Yeah, of course. Let me get my coat.	[]
Doctor	5	0	There we go, little buddy.	[]
Kenny	3	0	(Thank you, Doc.)	[]
Doctor	14	0	You sure you don't wanna take your jacket off; it's pretty warm.	[]
Kenny	4	0	(I'm all right)	[]
Nurse	6	0	Hey, look who has some visitors.	[]
Doctor	16	0	Hmm, what a lucky little man. We'll be right outside if you need us, Kenny.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Hey dude, how's it going?	[]
Kenny	5	0	(I'm okay, I guess.)	[]
Cartman	10	0	We got you a present: it's a Gobo fighter.	[]
Kyle	11	0	Heh, don't, don't tell him what it is, dude.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Heh, sorry.	[]
Kyle	29	0	Hey, uh- we were all just talkin' about how when you get better, we're all gonna go down to Stark's Pond again and go camping. Huh, Stan?	[]
Stan	1	0	I-	[]
Kyle	6	0	Stan?  Stan, where are you going?	[]
Stan	7	0	I can't, I just can't.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Dude, he needs us right now.	[]
Stan	28	0	I can't see him like that, Kyle. All those hoses and wires. He's a kid, dude. He's s'posed to be running around and laughing.	[]
Kyle	26	0	I, I know it's tough but-  Look at me!  I know it's tough, okay?! I know! But we have to be tough right now!	[]
Stan	28	0	And what are we supposed to do, huh?! Stand in that room and keep making small talk?! Make believe like everything's okay?! I CAN'T DO IT!	[]
Kyle	15	0	Look, however hard you think it for you, it's a lot harder for him!	[]
Stan	4	0	Just leave me alone!	[]
Kyle	5	0	Stan, you can't leave!	[]
Stan	10	0	I'm not the one who's leaving, he is!	[]
Cartman	50	0	...You know, it's funny, Kenny. Stan and Kyle have always been sort of two best friends, you know, and... well I- I don't know if I ever told you this, Kenny, but um... I kind of always thought you were my best f-friend. I don't know.	[]
Kenny	8	0	(Eric, well you're my best friend, too.)	[]
Nurse	13	0	Okay, we're gonna need to get Kenny some time to sleep now.	[]
Cartman	19	0	Don't you worry, Kenny. I I'm gonna find a cure for you. Everything's gonna be okay!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Cartman?	[]
Cartman	9	1	Oh, Kyle. Hey, what's goin' down, Jew-boy?	['jew']
Kyle	4	0	Cartman, were you... crying?	[]
Cartman	24	0	' No! No, I mean, I, I got somethin' in my eyes. It's this uh, the air in here is just- uh.  Oh man.	[]
Kyle	9	0	Hey Cartman.  I care a lot about him, too.	[]
Cartman	17	0	I'm gonna find a cure, Kyle. I swear to God I'm gonna find a cure.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Sure you will, Cartman. Sure you will.	[]
Larry	24	0	This is where the bulk of our research was being done. But due to the government ban, we're mostly just packing things up.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Doctor, can you tell me exactly how stem cells work?	[]
Larry	49	0	Look, you have trillions of cells in your body: heart cells, skin cells, brain cells, and so on. But before a cell is designated as a toenail cell or a pancreas cell, it's what we call a stem cell. Sort of like a blank cell. Do you understand?	[]
Cartman	6	0	Not at all, but go on.	[]
Larry	50	0	Because these cells are blanks, they will often program themselves based on what cells you put around them. You see this rat? Earlier this year, we surgically removed the middle of her spine. then we injected her with some stem cells and... they became the missing part of the spine.	[]
Cartman	2	0	My God...	[]
Larry	23	0	Nerve cells damaged by Parkinson's disease or heart tissue of cardiac patients might ultimately be replaced by tissue grown from stem cells.	[]
Cartman	36	0	So then, could stem cells be used on someone whose muscle tissue is wasting away? In other words, if a little boy was dying from a muscular disease, the stem cells could become new muscle tissue.	[]
Larry	4	0	That's the theory.	[]
Cartman	41	0	Well, so then, if the stem cells are placed nest to s Shakey's Pizza, they would become another Shakey's Pizza! And you'd have your own Shakey's Pizza where you didn't have to charge yourself to eat!	[]
Larry	14	0	Well, no. To build another Shake's it would be better to use lumber.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Hmmm.	[]
Larry	15	0	But, unfortunately, the government has banned stem cell research and so... we'll never know.	[]
Cartman	14	0	Looks like someone is gonna have to try and change the government's mind.	[]
Larry	4	0	Where are you going?	[]
Cartman	25	0	There's a pretty brave kid fighting for his life in the hospital right now, doctor. I'm gonna get him some bigger boxing gloves.	[]
Larry	8	2	Hey kid.  Give 'em hell. Give 'em hell.	['hell', 'hell']
Cartman	4	0	Oh, doctor.  Thanks. Thanks.	[]
Larry	7	0	Oh, hey kid.  Good luck. Good luck.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Oh, and doctor. ...Ah, never mind.	[]
Kyle	33	0	...And see? Here's one from Butters. It says, We can't wait to see you back in school, Kenny. And it has a picture of him and you in a little airplane!	[]
Chef	15	0	Oh, isn't that nice? You've got lots of friends, don't you Kenny?	[]
Kenny	5	0	(Yes.)  (But what about Stan?)	[]
Kyle	24	0	Stan? Oh. Well, no, there's nothing here from Stan, but, well, Stan's gonna come and see you real soon, I bet, Kenny.	[]
Kenny	3	0	(I hope so)	[]
Nurse	5	0	Hey, look who's here.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Stan??)	[]
Woman	11	0	Hello, Kenny, I'm Laura Jones, and this is Bob Ferrin.	[]
Bob	8	0	We're with the Make-A-Wish Foundation.	[]
Ms. McCormick	6	0	Oh, Kenny, isn't that nice?	[]
Kenny	5	0	(The Make-A-Wish Foundation?)	[]
Laura	15	0	We travel the country given special little boys and girls like you their biggest wish.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Neat, huh Kenny?	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Yes.)	[]
Laura	12	0	So Kenny, if you could have ONE wish, what would it be?	[]
Bob	5	0	What's your wish, pal?	[]
Kenny	11	0	(I guess the only thing I wish is to not die.)	[]
Laura	4	0	What did he say?	[]
Kyle	8	0	He said his wish is not to die.	[]
Laura	17	0	...O-kay, and, what if you're gonna have two wishes, what would the second one be?	[]
Bob	9	0	I know! I bet you wanna meet Madonna, huh?	[]
Kenny	3	1	(No. Fuckin' Madonna...)	['fuckin']
Bob	4	0	Wu- what was that?	[]
Kyle	38	2	He said Madonna is an old anorexic whore who wore out her welcome years ago, and that now she suddenly speaks with a British accent and she thinks she can play guitar and she should go fuck herself.	['whore', 'fuck']
Madonna	5	0	Should I come in now?	[]
Bob	5	0	Uh no not quite yet.	[]
Chef	3	0	Hello there, children.	[]
Stan	2	0	Hey Chef.	[]
Chef	4	0	How's it goin'?	[]
Stan	1	0	Bad.	[]
Chef	5	0	Yeah. Things have been better.	[]
Stan	26	0	Why would God let Kenny die, Chef? Why? Kenny's my fr-f-f-friend. Why can't God take someone else's f-f-friend?	[]
Chef	69	0	Stan, sometimes God takes those closest to us, because it makes him feel better about himself. He is a very vengeful God, Stan. He's all pissed off about something we did thousands of years ago. He just can't get over it, so he doesn't care who he takes. Children, puppies, it don't matter to him, so long as it makes us sad. Do you understand.	[]
Stan	11	0	But then, why does God give us anything to start with?	[]
Chef	91	0	Well, look at it this way: if you want to make a baby cry, first you give it a lollipop. Then you take it away. If you never give it a lollipop to begin with, then it would have nothin' to cry about. That's like God, who gives us life and love and help just so that he can tear it all away and make us cry, so he can drink the sweet milk of our tears. You see, it's our tears, Stan, that give God his great power.	[]
Stan	4	0	I think I understand.	[]
Cartman	180	0	My name is Eric Cartman and I live in Colorado. My best friend in the whole world is Kenny McCormick and he, he's sick right now. He's real sick. He's only eight years old and his doctors don't think he has very long to live. Look, I realize that using the tissue from aborted fetuses for research is a touchy subject, but... All I know is that if there's a chance, a... chance that stem-cell research could save my best friend's life, well... I guess I owe it to him to try and change your minds.  I love Kenny McCormick and...  I want you to love him too.  And I uh, I'm not the best speaker in the world. Maybe I can put it best in the words of a timeless song  It was the heat of the moment telling me what your heart meant The heat of the moment shone in your eyes I never meant to be so bad to you One thing I said that I would never do	[]
Congressman 1	10	0	One look from you and I would fall from grace.	[]
Congressman 2	10	0	And that would wipe the smile right from my face.	[]
"Congressman 1, Cartman"	8	0	Do you remember when we used to dance?	[]
A few Congressmen	5	0	And incidents arose from circumstance?	[]
Everyone	37	0	One thing led to another; we were young  And we would scream together songs unsung It was the heat of the moment Telling me what our hearts meant The heat of the moment shone in your eyes	[]
Cartman	25	0	And so you see, now that the ban on stem-cell research has been lifted, we can sell your fetus to companies like Alder Labs.	[]
Woman	5	0	Oh, I don't know.	[]
Cartman	14	0	Look, I can offer you seventy-five dollars for that fetus right now, Jill.	[]
Jill	5	0	Seventy-five dollars? Well, alright.	[]
Cartman	61	0	Great, just sign right here, please.  Hi. Havin' an abortion today?  Great.  Listen, if you'd like to sell your abortion for research I'm offering uh, seventy-five dollars. Help you out a little bit with your medical bill in there.  And you sign right here.  Uh excuse me, ma'am. Can I interest you in selling your aborted fetus?	[]
Woman 2	15	0	We're not going to the abortion clinic. I'm going to have this baby.	[]
Cartman	41	0	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, because uh, there's a little boy dying in a hospital right now who sure could use that baby more than you could. The stem cells from your fetus could help save his life.	[]
Man	11	0	Oh. Well, I guess we can always... just make another one.	[]
Woman 2	5	0	Oh Mark, I love you.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Alright! Now Kenny has a fighting chance.	[]
Head nurse	9	0	Young man, do you know where you're going?	[]
Stan	13	0	Yeah. I'm gonna see my friend, because he needs me right now.	[]
Head nurse	2	0	All right!	[]
Man In Wheelchair	2	0	Go kid!	[]
Man On Crutches	3	0	Good for you!	[]
Stan	5	0	Hey, Kenny!  Oh no.  No.	[]
Kyle	10	0	He just... He just... stopped breathing. And it was over.	[]
Stan	25	1	But...  I didn't get to see him. Hell I, I didn't get to sssay good-bye.  Did he say anything before he went?	['hell']
Kyle	6	0	He just said... Where's Stan?	[]
Mr. Garrison	33	0	And so, we will all miss Kenny, his playful laughter, his innocent smile. But we will never forget that it was because of brave Kenny that stem-cell research was allowed to continue.	[]
Stan	12	0	I let Kenny down. I'm his worst f-f-f-friend.	[]
Cartman	4	0	You guys! Come quick!	[]
Kyle	2	0	What, Cartman?	[]
Cartman	9	0	It's...  Why, it's a miracle, you guys!	[]
Stan	5	0	What, Cartman? What's happened?	[]
Cartman	27	0	Look.  I put the stem cells from all the fetuses I had next to a Shakey's, and they ARE replicating a new Shakey's!  It worked!	[]
Stan	25	0	This whole time, you were just using Kenny's illness to lift the ban on stem cell research so you could sell your stupid fetuses?	[]
Cartman	8	0	Stupid fetuses? It's my own Shakey's!	[]
Kyle	15	0	I actually hugged you. I held you in my arms and, and, cried with you.	[]
Cartman	19	0	I think I only need a hundred or so more aborted babies,  and I can finish up the kitchen.	[]
Kyle	1	0	AAARGH!	[]
Cartman	3	0	Aah! Kyle!  Kyle!	[]
Stan	13	0	Hey, I wasn't Kenny's worst f-f-f-friend!  Cartman was!	[]
