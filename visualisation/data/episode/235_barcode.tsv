Stan	3	0	We're rich?	[]
Shelly	1	0	Finally.	[]
Sharon	5	0	Randy, are you being serious?	[]
Randy	29	0	I just wanted to wait until the deal was all finished. We are going into business for ourselves! You are all looking at the new owner of Blockbuster Video!	[]
Stan	2	0	Blockbuster Video?	[]
Randy	42	0	Last week, I saw it was up for sale. On a fluke I asked how much. $10,000! Can you believe it?! We have the entire business! And we can watch movies whenever we want! Come on, you guys wanna see it?	[]
Randy	11	0	You're gonna love it, Sharon. It is in pristine condition.	[]
Sharon	14	0	I just wish you'd have talked to me before spending all our money.	[]
Randy	30	0	Sharon, it was $10,000 for the entire place! It wasn't gonna last! Don't worry, we'll make the money back in a week. Guaranteed. You excited, Stan?	[]

Shelly	7	0	I don't wanna go in there.	[]
Randy	3	0	Shelly come on!	[]
Randy	27	0	Can you believe it? Completely turnkey!  Yo got your sci-fi, comedies, buddy flicks, chick flicks, all on Blu-ray or DVD!  Well, what do you think?	[]
Stan	24	0	It's awesome. You should try to get it on that Ancient Civilizations show so that people can see how cultures used to live.	[]
Randy	20	0	Oh hahahaha, I get it. Blockbuster is so out of date it's ancient. Haha Sharon, okay I get it.	[]
Sharon	5	0	I didn't say anything.	[]
Randy	34	2	You were thinking it. But you're wrong. The average person still wants to rent movies they can hold in their hands. We're gonna have customers up our ass Sharon, UP OUR ASS.	['ass', 'ass']
Randy	16	0	How many uh, how many copies of Meet The Fockers do we have in stock, Shelly?	[]

Randy	21	0	Hahaha, haha! You can be a spooky ghost all you want, it wasn't a stupid idea to buy this place!	[]
Ghost	10	0	The hounds are calling, Emily. Let's rent something now!	[]
Randy	24	0	I'll have you know that Netflix, Hulu, and Crackle still don't make the money Blockbuster does! Streaming movies is not for everyone!	[]
Ghost	5	0	The hounds, Emily! The hounds!	[]
Randy	45	1	Go ahead! All you want, bro! All you want! It was a great idea, but no! Everyone just wants to prove that Rrrandy's gone crazy!  Oh don't mind Randy, he's just losing his mind!  Drrrr! You know what? Fuck you and Emily!	['fuck']
Stan	8	0	I think something might be wrong with Dad?	[]
Sharon	2	0	Ya think?	[]
Butters	11	0	Oh hey Eric and Kenny. You guys don't have costumes?	[]

Kenny	1	0	(Yeah.)	[]
Cartman	8	0	Uhhh what are you supposed to be, Butters?	[]
Butters	20	0	I'm a wereprechaun. You know, a leprechaun that's been bitten by a werewolf. And Jimmy's Gangnam Style.	[]
Jimmy	7	0	Wop. Wop, Wop wop, Wopwop Gangnam Style.	[]

Stan	5	0	Dad, nobody's gonna come.	[]
Randy	25	0	Oho you'll see! I'm sorry, Stan, but in about thirty minutes this place is gonna be swamped with people trying to rent DVDs!	[]
Stan	9	1	Renting DVDs is more ancient than Madonna's boobs!	['boobs']
Randy	7	0	Ew!  That's enough, Stanley! Ew, gross!	[]
Stan	28	0	I can't go trick-or-treating! My dad says I have to stay and help with the store! Yes, I'm serious! I know it sucks, Kyle!	[]
Kyle	15	0	Dude, you can't do this! How can we be the Avengers without Captain America?	[]
Stan	9	0	I know, but there's nothing I can do.	[]
Kyle	6	0	But what about the costume contest?!	[]
Kenny	5	0	What's going on, Kyle?	[]
Kyle	4	0	Stan can't come.	[]
Cartman	10	1	Stan can't come?! But he's fucking Captain America!	['fucking']
Stan	13	0	I'm sorry you guys. My dad is doing a big Halloween promotion.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Does anybody even go to Blockbuster anymore?	[]
Stan	21	0	No dude. Nobody. My dad... he's kind of losing it. To be honest, I feel kind of bad for him.	[]
Randy	15	1	Stan, get off the damned phone! People are gonna start callin' to reserve movies! Gau!	['damned']
Stan	7	0	Oh never mind, I hate him again.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Dude, you can't miss Halloween! You have your iPad?	[]

Kyle	9	0	All right, where should we trick-or-treat first?	[]
Stan	15	0	How about we try the Barkers? Oh, no, it looks like they're not home.	[]
Cartman	21	1	This is fucking ridiculous! We've been planning this Halloween for two months, and Stan has to go and ruin it!	['fucking']
Kyle	3	0	He looks fine.	[]
Stan	8	0	Oh, let's go to the Petersons' house.	[]
Cartman	31	0	Yeah, he looks totally fine, except that when we walk up to a house, people are gonna be like, Oh wow, it's the Avengers, and some Captain FaceTime skateboard guy!	[]
The Boys	3	0	Trick or treat.	[]
Stan	3	0	Trick or treat.	[]
Man 1	14	0	Oh wuhow! Look honey, it's Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, and Bruce Vilanch.	[]
Cartman	5	0	I'm not Bruce Vilanch!	[]
Man 1	18	0	Oh, what are you supposed to be? Oh  oh, right. You're supposed to be that um... uhhh...	[]
Cartman	2	0	The Incredible...	[]

Randy	40	0	Wuhy? Why isn't anyone showing up?!  It's Halloween night! People should be renting spooky movies!  What's happened to the world? Things used to be so simple.  Good evening, fine sir! I would like to rent a movie!	[]
Ghost 2	8	0	Of course, Mr. Marsh. What'll it be?	[]
Randy	16	0	I'll take a DVD of Robocop 2 and the director's cut of Blade Runner.	[]
Ghost 2	3	0	Coming right up.	[]
Randy	13	0	No place like the video store, eh, my friend? Convenience at its peak.	[]
Ghost 2	32	1	Your son and wife don't seem to quite agree with you about the video store. In fact, your son seems to think video stores are... as ancient as Madonna's boobs?	['boobs']
Randy	15	0	He's a... he's a very... progressive... little boy. Gets it from his mother.	[]
Ghost 2	36	0	If I may say so, Mr. Marsh, your Blockbuster will never get any customers with those two Negative Nancys sabotaging you. You may need to do something... rather extreme.  If I may say so, Mr. Marsh.	[]
Stan	3	0	Trick or treat.	[]
Ghost 2	15	0	You are the owner of Blockbuster, Mr. Marsh.  You must be willing to do anything.	[]
Randy	20	0	No! No I won't do it! Leave him out of this! He's just a little boy!  Hey Stan.	[]

You're watching The Thing? Oh that's fun. On Netflix or Hulu? On your Xbox, uh huh. Yeah, no, at some point I'm hoping we can just call it a night and go home.  No, you don't need to send help. Thanks, though. Are you guys getting a lot of trick-or-treaters? Yeah? Oh really?  Oh, Barbara and Michael? Oh yeah. Uh huh. Ha-hang on a second Karen.  Can I help you with something?	[]
Randy	36	0	According to industry experts, many rural areas don't have the bandwidth to support DVD-quality video in streaming services, and won't for years to come, making DVD rentals still the best movie-watching option.	[]
Sharon	25	0	Sorry, Karen, you were saying? No, it wasn't a customer. No, it's just Randy.  Yes, a customer would have been nice, I know.	[]
Robber 1	13	1	God damn it those kids saw us! And you let them get away!	['damn']

Cartman	18	0	Oh my God. You mean they don't know people can stream movies cheaper and more conveniently online?	[]
Sgt. Yates	15	0	Apparently not. These are dangerous guys. Do you have any idea where they were headed?	[]
Officer	13	0	Sir, there's a kid over at the hospital saying he saw everything.	[]
Stan	23	0	They said they were heading to the big party at the community center. You have to stop it. My friends are in trouble.	[]

Kenny	5	0	Yes. We saw their faces.	[]
Sgt. Yates	17	0	All right then. We're gonna have to send one of you into the party in disguise.	[]
Butters	32	0	That sure is a great Gangnam Style costume, Craig. I'm a wereprechaun. You know, a leprechaun that has been bitten by a werewolf.  Oh wow! Nice costume, Stan. It's Gangnamstein!	[]
