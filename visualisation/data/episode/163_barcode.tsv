Cartman	25	0	All right, let's try over here.  Set up traps there, and there as well.  Last time I saw him he ran right through here.	[]
Kyle	13	1	This is so retarded, Cartman. You've got everyone believing your stupid story.	['retarded']
Cartman	34	0	It isn't a story, it's true! I saw a leprechaun. I've seen him come through here three days in a row now.  Hawk Eyes, this is Dragon Wind. Do you copy?	[]
Clyde	15	0	This is Hawk Eyes. We've set up the net and we're standing by.	[]
Cartman	12	0	Copy that, Hawk Eyes. Keep surveillance tag Alpha Niner. Dragon Wind out.	[]
Kyle	12	0	Just admit you were lying, Cartman, so that everyone can go home!	[]
Cartman	32	2	O-ho no! We have a deal, Kyle! If I can prove there's a leprechaun, you have to suck my balls, remember?!  Dragon Wind to Blackie: What's your six, Blackie?	['ho', 'balls']
Token	8	0	... I don't want the code name Blackie.	[]
Cartman	15	0	Code names are what they are, Blackie! Check your six and alert when in position!	[]
Kyle	4	2	This is fucking retarded!	['fucking', 'retarded']
Cartman	24	1	Hahaha, getting nervous, Kyle? When that leprechauns shows up you must suck my balls! Don't forget I have a signed contract from you.	['balls']
Kyle	26	0	Yeah, and if you couldn't prove there was a leprechaun, you have to give me ten dollars! Now just pay up and stop being stupid!	[]
Cartman	15	3	Goddammit, why hasn't it shown up yet?  Dragon Wind to Faggot! Come in, Faggot!	['goddammit', 'faggot', 'faggot']
Butters	5	1	This is faggot. Go ahead.	['faggot']
Cartman	15	1	Faggot I need you to keep surveillance North to North East. Check back in five.	['faggot']
Butters	6	1	Okay, will do. Faggot out.  Waagh.	['faggot']
Kyle	28	0	Okay, that's enough.  Everybody! Cartman is just pulling one of his stupid tricks on everyone, because he's trying to get out of a deal he made!	[]
Cartman	18	0	It was here, I swear it! I don't know why it's not showin' up this time!	[]
Kyle	32	1	You didn't see a leprechaun, fatass! If you could prove it, I had to suck your balls, but if you couldn't, you had to pay me ten dollars! Pay up!	['balls']
Butters	18	0	Uh, I got somethin'! I got it!  It's uh... Oh jeez I thnk it's a leprechaun!	[]
Cartman	5	0	Set off diversion track C!	[]
Stan	1	0	Dude...	[]
Jimmy	7	1	Fuh, fuck me, it's a leprechaun.	['fuck']
Cartman	10	1	Get it!  Get that fucking leprechaun! I want it alive!	['fucking']
Butters	1	0	Wow.	[]
Stan	1	0	Cool.	[]
Craig	2	0	No way.	[]
Token	1	0	Whoa.	[]
Jason	1	0	Wow.	[]
Cartman	13	1	Eugh! Uh, move aside! Move aside! All right, butthole, where's the gold?!	['butthole']
Leprechaun	23	0	You lads don't know what you're doin'. I need to deliver an important message! There's goin' to be an attack!	[]
Cartman	10	0	Tell me where the gold is or you die!  Slow!	[]
Stan	4	0	Where'd he go?	[]
Leprechaun	25	0	I was sent to warn of a terrorist attack, but you boys have made me late. Now the terrorists will prevail! The end is near!	[]
Craig	1	0	Dude.	[]
Cartman	4	1	Kyle, suck my balls.	['balls']
Kyle	6	0	Dad, where do leprechauns come from?	[]
Gerald	2	0	From Ireland.	[]
Kyle	14	0	So... why would one come to America to warn us about a terrorist attack.	[]
Sheila	20	0	Kyle, leprechauns aren't real. You're almost nine now; you need to understand the difference beween real and imaginary.	[]
Kyle	4	0	I thought I did.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Ohhh, Ms. Broflovski, how are you this fine evening?	[]
Sheila	8	0	Oh,hello Eric.  Kyle, your friend is here.	[]
Cartman	22	0	Hello, Mr. Broflovski, Ike. Nice evening, isn't it? Well Kyle, shall we go up to your room for a few minutes.	[]
Kyle	9	0	Get out of here, Cartman, we're eating dinner!	[]
Cartman	19	1	Uhh, Kyle, I believe a certain someone is supposed to put a certain set of balls in their mouth.	['balls']
Kyle	6	0	I'm not doing it, fatass!	[]
Gerald	2	0	Doing what?	[]
Cartman	5	0	We had a deal, Kyle!	[]
Kyle	5	0	Just get out of here!	[]
Cartman	5	0	You signed an agreement, Kyle!!	[]
Kyle	9	0	I don't care if I signed an agreement!	[]
Gerald	17	0	Ah hey now Kyle, if you made a deal with somebody, you have to stick by it.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Thank you, Mr. Broflovski.	[]
Gerald	4	0	What was the agreement?	[]
Kyle	12	1	That if he could prove leprechauns exist, I would suck his balls.	['balls']
Sheila	1	0	Whatwhatwhat?!	[]
Cartman	9	0	And there was a leprechaun! You saw it, Kyle!!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Hey dudes.	[]
Jimmy	6	0	Hey Kyle. So, ...how was it?	[]
Kyle	3	0	How was what?	[]
Jimmy	5	1	Sucking Cartman's b-balls.	['balls']
Kyle	14	1	I didn't suck his balls, all right?! And I'm not going to!	['balls']
Stan	14	1	Dude, why did you ever agree to suck his balls in the first place.	['balls']
Kyle	34	0	Uch, I didn't think there would actually be a leprechaun! And I still don't! Why would a leprechaun be warning us of a terrorist attack?! There's another explanation for all this.	[]
Fanciful Mayor	10	0	Excuse me. Have you boys seen a leprechaun anywhere lately?	[]
Stan	7	0	...What do you know about the leprechaun?	[]
Fanciful Mayor	25	0	Ooooo, then you did see him.  That's splendiferous! I want you to tell me everything he said. Where was he? What was he doing?	[]
Kyle	9	0	All right I've had enough! Leprechauns are imaginary!	[]
Fanciful Mayor	62	0	Well of course they are. But just because they're imaginary doesn't mean they're not real. Haven't you boys ever used your imagination?  You young man! How would you like to be a cowboy? Or a- swashbuckling pirate?  And you! How would you like to be an astronaut, faaar out in space? All it takes is a little...  imagination.	[]
Stan	5	1	Who the hell are you?	['hell']
Fanciful Mayor	21	0	Still not convinced, eh? I tell you what, boys. What say we all take a ride on my... Imagination Flying Machine?	[]
Kyle	1	0	Dude.	[]
Fanciful Mayor	9	0	Hop aboard, kids. I have something to show you.	[]
Butters	6	1	Uhhh, are you gonna rape us?	['rape']
Fanciful Mayor	4	0	Ubeuh... uh... n... no?	[]
Butters	4	0	Ah, all right then.	[]
Stan	3	0	Come on, guys.	[]
Butters	13	1	Watch it, fellas. I'm pretty sure this guy wants to rape us.	['rape']
Fanciful Mayor	34	0	All aboard the Imagination Balloon!  Some people feel imagination isn't real, but I tell them that they're wrong, 'cause whenever I want to play and pretend, I just sing the Imagination Sooong .	[]
Kyle	8	0	Are you gonna take us somewhere or not?!	[]
Fanciful Mayor	9	0	Oh- Ohhh. But my boy, we're already here.	[]
The Boys	1	0	Whoa...	[]
Stan	4	0	What is this place?	[]
Fanciful Mayor	33	0	This... is Imaginationland.  It's where all the wonderful and goofy things that humans have made up over the years live together.  Citizens of Imaginationland! We have distinguished guests from the world beyond!	[]
Cheetara	1	0	Hello.	[]
Lollipop King	8	0	Welcome to Imaginationland. I am the Lollipop King.	[]
Mr. Tumnus	9	0	We are honored to have Creators in our kingdom.	[]
Fanciful Mayor	10	0	Now, good news, everyone! These boys did see the leprechaun!	[]
Pat the Hammer	10	0	What did he tell you? Did he have any news?	[]
Stan	14	0	Well he said there was gonna be a- ...that there was... gonna be a-	[]
A Terrorist	1	0	ALLAH!!!	[]
Fanciful Mayor	3	1	OH FUCK NO!	['fuck']
Charlie Brown	1	0	Awwwgh!	[]
Cheetara	1	0	AAAAAH!	[]
Kyle	8	0	STAN, WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!	[]
Draco	6	0	Quickly boys! Get on my back!	[]
Butters	6	0	Fellas! Fellas wait!  Hold on, fellas!	[]
Stan	1	0	Butters.	[]
Butters	7	0	Don't leave me, fellas! Come back!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Dude!	[]
Butters	2	0	Hey guys!	[]
The Boys	2	0	Goodbye Butters.	[]
Kyle	27	0	A-ah! A-a-ah! Wha? Where...? Oh. Oh dude. Oh, it was just a dream. It was all just a crazy dream. Huh, oh my God.	[]
Stan	1	0	Hello?	[]
Kyle	16	0	Dude, did you finish your math homework? I kind of lost track of time last night.	[]
Stan	30	1	No no I I hardly got any sleep. I had this whole messed up dream about some gay Mayor guy taking us to Imaginationland where all these imaginary characters live?	['gay']
Kyle	7	0	...And then it got attacked by terrorists?	[]
Stan	5	0	Yeah! How'd you know?	[]
Kyle	19	0	Dude! I had the same dream! We jumped on a dragon's back and, and Butters got left behind!	[]
Sharon	12	0	Stan? Stanley? You haven't seen your little friend Butters, have you?	[]
Stan	1	0	Why?	[]
Linda	8	0	Our darling Butters never came home last night.	[]
Kyle	4	0	What did they say??	[]
Steven	33	0	We don't wanna jump to conclusions, but... we're worried that maybe somebody kidnapped Butters, sodomized him over and over again, and then fed his genitals to wild animals.  There there, darling.	[]
Kyle	1	0	...Dude...	[]
General	18	0	Ladies and gentlemen, I have dire news. Yesterday, at approximately 18:00 hours, terrorists successfully attacked... our imagination.	[]
Man 1	2	0	Our imagination?	[]
Woman 1	1	0	How?	[]
Specialist	21	0	The imaginary attack appears to have been in the works for years. The effects of the attack are so far... unimaginable.	[]
General	21	0	We've intercepted this videotape the terrorists made for broadcast. Luckily we've kept it from being broadcast to the public.	[]
Fanciful Mayor	7	0	No! It's just a Care Bear!	[]
Man 2	3	0	Oh my God.	[]
General	16	0	Later in the video we can see another imaginary hostage; this one reading a forced statement.	[]
Butters	66	0	Praise to the mighty Allah. His divine grace a-and will have brought forth this day.  Oh jeez!  Uhhh, nnow see, your safety is at our whim. This is the price you pay, America! You have defiled Allah, and now we will turn your imagination against you! Death to the Infidels!  Can I go now?  Stan! Kyle! Could you could you get me out of here??	[]
General	24	0	Gentlemen, the terrorists appear to have complete control of our imagination. It's only a matter of time before... our imaginations start running wild.	[]
Cartman	91	3	I believe a serious blow to democracy has just been dealt.  A travesty has occurred, and I want justice! Kyle Broflovski did willingly and knowingly sign a contract, and yet, to date, he has made no effort, nor does he show any intention, of ever sucking my balls!  I've given him ample time to fulfill his obligation, and he has thus refused. I stand before you with dry balls, Your Honor. I've provided witnesses, collected testimonials, and still, my balls remain dry. I want what I'm entitled to!	['balls', 'balls', 'balls']
Judge	14	1	Mr. Broflovski, did you agree to orally imbibe Mr. Cartman's scrotum and testicles?	['scrotum']
Kyle	1	0	I...	[]
Judge	8	0	Is this not your signature on the contract?	[]
Kyle	21	0	Uh... W-uh... but... Come o- come on! Really? I mean, aren't there more important things going on right now?	[]
Judge	41	0	From what I've been presented and the evidence put forth, the court has no choice but to order you to place Mr. Cartman's pubicle sac in your mouth, and draw upon it succulently for no less than 30 seconds.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Yesss!	[]
Judge	28	1	You have twenty four hours to suck aforementioned balls. If after that time you still refuse, the court will be forced to arrest you for contempt. Next case!	['balls']
Cartman	22	1	Thank you Your Honor. This isn't a victory for me, this is a victory for the justice system. And my balls.	['balls']
General	33	0	What I am about to tell you is highly classified. Two days ago, Muslim terrorists hijacked our imagination.  Frankly we don't know what their next move is or how to stop them.	[]
Specialist	23	0	In times like these the government often turns to Hollywood for help. You creative filmmakers can think of idea we just can't.	[]
General	37	0	That's why we've asked you here, M. Night Shyal-amalam.  The Sixth Sense, Signs, The Village, all very clever films. But can you use your amazing idea brain now to help us stop the terrorists?	[]
M. Night Shyalaman	19	0	What if...  What if it turns out they aren't terrorists? But they're actually werewolves? From the future?	[]
General	13	0	N, no. No, they're terrorists. They've been linked to Al Qaeda.	[]
M. Night Shyalaman	15	0	But what if Al Qaeda, it turns out, is the group being terrorized? By aliens?	[]
General	14	0	No- No. That's not an idea, that's a twist. We need ideas.	[]
M. Night Shyalaman	17	0	How about we make everyone think that terrorists attacked us? But really, we were all already dead.	[]
General	18	0	Get him out of here.  Mr. Bay, can you think of any idea how to outwit these terrorists?	[]
Michael Bay	41	0	I believe I can.  We start... by making a big CG building and then we have a meteor go CROSSHH!  and it, and it's all like CRAAWWWLL  a-and motorcycles burst into flame while they jump over these helicopters, right?	[]
General	10	0	No no! We need ideas how to stop the terrorists!	[]
Michael Bay	21	0	An eighteen-wheeler spins out of control and it's all like BROSSHH  And then this huuuge tanker full of dyna-	[]
General	8	0	Those aren't ideas, those are special effects!	[]
Michael Bay	6	0	I... don't understand the difference.	[]
General	28	0	I know you don't. Get him out of here!  Aaand being that we are all big Mel Gibson film fans, we thought maybe you could help us.	[]
Mel Gibson	11	0	Ah, my nipples, they hurt! They hurt when I twist them!	[]
General	16	0	Yes, uh, I don't suppose you have any creative ideas how to fight these terrorists?	[]
Mel Gibson	39	0	How about this? You have that tape that the terrorists made, right? Well, maybe if you did a background check on that videotape, you might find somebody who doesn't belong. Somebody who doesn't fit in Imaginationland! Ohhh!	[]
Specialist	7	0	Heyy... that's not a bad idea.	[]
General	29	1	Yeah. Say what you will about Mel Gibson, but the son of a bitch knows story structure. Get the videotape and do a background check on everyone in it!	['bitch']
Mel Gibson	2	0	Oogh! Yess!	[]
Specialist	34	0	All the imaginary characters in the tape were identified, sir. Count Chocula, Cinderella, Snarf from Thundercats... But here.  Nothing in American folklore or storytelling match this kid. He appears to be... just some kid.	[]
General	31	0	I want digital imaging and resource magnification done stat!  If that kid isn't imaginary, I want to know who he is, where he's from, and who his friends are!	[]
Specialist	2	0	Yes sir!	[]
General	3	0	Who are you?...	[]
Butters	35	0	Uh, excuse me? Uh Mr. Terrorist, sir?  Uh, I'm actually not imaginary, a-and um, my p-my parents are gonna ground me if I don't get back-  Aaah!  Okay, sorry. Uh sorry.	[]
Pat the Hammer	8	0	Can you tell what the terrorists are doing?	[]
Fanciful Mayor	7	0	They're going something to Rockety Rocket.	[]
Rockety Rocket	5	0	No! Leave me alone! Haaa!	[]
Cinderella	11	0	It doesn't make sense. What do they want with Rockety?	[]
Fanciful Mayor	15	0	The only reason they would-  Oh my God. They're gonna blow up the Barrier!	[]
Butters	5	0	Uh what's the Barrier?	[]
Fanciful Mayor	15	0	The wall! The wall which separates the evil side of Imaginationland from the good side!	[]
Rockety Rocket	12	0	No! No you can't blow up the barrier! Are you insane?!	[]
Cinderella	6	0	We can't let this happen.	[]
Suitcase	7	0	It will be the end of Imaginationland.	[]
Pat the Hammer	7	0	Yeah. You have to stop them, kid.	[]
Butters	8	0	Me?? Woo, what am I supposed to do?	[]
Fanciful Mayor	33	0	Don't you get it?! If the terrorists blow that barrier, all the most evil things ever imagined are gonna pour out and take over Imaginationland for good! YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING!!	[]
Butters	1	0	Waaahaa!	[]
Cartman	15	0	Thanks for coming, everyone. The big moment is almost here, as soon as Kyle arrives.	[]
Craig	11	1	He's not gonna show up to suck your balls dude.	['balls']
Cartman	10	0	He has to. He's been ordered by the court.	[]
Clyde	4	0	Hey, he's here.	[]
Cartman	5	0	What? Move aside, move aside!	[]
Stan	8	0	Dude, do you really have to do it?	[]
Kyle	7	0	Let's just get this over with!	[]
Cartman	14	1	Yes, come on in, peasant Kyle, and pay homage to this sultan's balls.	['balls']
Kyle	2	1	God damnit!	['damnit']
Cartman	2	0	Yehehehesss. Yehhhs!	[]
Specialist	9	0	That's them, sir. Stan Marsh and Kyle Broflovski.	[]
General	13	0	You boys need to come with us on a matter of national security.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Who are you?	[]
General	12	0	There's no time! You need to come with us right now!	[]
Cartman	5	0	Hey, let go of him!	[]
General	13	0	We aren't going to hurt your little friends. We just need information.	[]
Cartman	10	1	No! No, he has to suck my balls!  NO! KYYYYLE!	['balls']
Rockety Rocket	2	0	No! Noooo!	[]
Butters	69	0	Hold on! Hold on a second!  Now, you really should think about this. I mean, uh, I I know you think attacking our imagination will get you somewhere, but will it really? If you destroy that wall, all the most evil parts of our imagination are gonna break loose, but... will it really make you terrorists feel better? Maybe it's time for us all to just... get along.	[]
Terrorists	1	0	ALLAH!!	[]
Rockety Rocket	4	0	AAAAAAAH! Jesus Christ, no!!	[]
Fanciful Mayor	7	0	That was your plan to stop them??	[]
Butters	9	0	Y-yeah, and that's not a heartfelt speech?	[]
Fanciful Mayor	7	1	That's fucking stupid!  They are coming...	['fucking']
Driver	16	0	Glad I picked you up, kid. It's dangerous for someone your age to be hitchhikin'	[]
Cartman	14	0	Yeah well, when a man has been wronged... he no longer cares about danger.	[]
Driver	7	0	You goin' to Washington to visit family?	[]
Cartman	40	1	I've got unfinished business. You go through life being told there's justice, then you learn that the only real justice...  is the justice you take.  Make no mistake, Kyle. Before this is over, you will suck my balls.	['balls']
