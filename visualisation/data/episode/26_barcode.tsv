Cartman	1	0	Sweet.	[]
Jimbo	83	0	Okay, everybody, okay. Settle down. Now I know you're all anxious to get to the Running of the Cows, BUT, let me remind you: those brave souls who have decided to run against the cows through town do so at their own risk. I don't think I have to remind you that three people died in last year's Running of the Cows.  With that said, let's rock and roll!  Everybody ready to run?  Release the cows!  They're loose!	[]
Cows	1	0	Mooooo?!	[]

Kyle	8	0	Is it like a- haunted house or something?	[]
Operator	5	0	Sure. It's veery scary.	[]
Cartman	16	0	Let's see: each ticket is a dollar, so three tickets is like two twenty-five.	[]
Kyle	14	0	No. We can't, dude. We have to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls.	[]
Cartman	13	0	Oh come on, you guys. We still have plenty of money left over.	[]
Kyle	6	0	You'd better be right, dude.	[]
Cartman	3	0	I'm right!	[]

Officer Barbrady	1	0	Why?	[]
Kyle	14	1	This game is fixed! The balls are bigger than Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth!	['balls']
Officer Barbrady	19	0	If that is true, then your declaration of Shenanigans is just.  What do you have to say, carnival operator?	[]
Operator	28	0	Look, the kid was really close. He still has another ball left. Leh let's try again, son.  Here you go.  There, you see? We have a winner!	[]
