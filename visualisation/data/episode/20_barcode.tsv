Kyle	7	0	Yeah, what are we supposed to do?	[]
Ms. Crabtree	10	0	Just keep your trap shut. I'll consult the manual.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Ms. Crabtree?	[]
Ms. Crabtree	10	0	SHUT UP, KIID! I HAVE TO WATCH A TRAINING VIDEO!	[]
Trainer	106	0	Welcome to tape 7 of the bus driver's video guidebook. What to do if you become stranded. By now you've calmed down the children and kept order by using the 'keep quiet or I'll kill the bunny' technique. Now, it's time to get help. The most important thing to remember is that the children will be safe as long as they stay on the bus. So do not, under any circumstances, let any children off the bus. The best way to achieve this is to tell them something like, 'A big scary monster will eat you if you step off the bus.'	[]
Ms. Crabtree	17	0	KIIDS, DO NOT GET OFF THIS BUS. IF YOU DO A BIG SCARY MONSTER WILL EAT YOU!	[]
Trainer	31	0	That's right. With the children properly subdued, you can leave the bus and go out looking for assistance. And remember your bus driver's code: 'Sit down. And shut up!'	[]
Ms. Crabtree	29	0	I'm goin' for help. Ah'll be back as soon as I can. Remember. Don't get off this bus, or a big scary monster WILL EAT YOU!	[]
Boy In The Red Shirt	9	0	Hey, why doesn't the scary monster eat her?	[]
Kyle	11	3	'Cause, dombass, scary monsters don't eat big fat smelly bitches!	['dombass', 'fat', 'bitches']

Ms. Crabtree	1	0	Oh.	[]
Stan	14	0	Dude, this is not good! She could've at least kept the heat on.	[]
Ms. Crabtree	8	0	Had to happen to me, didn't it?	[]
Truck Driver	32	0	Lookin' for love in all the wrong places Lookin' for love in too- Whoa uhih, it's supper time. Come to poppa.  Whoa uh heh hello, little lady-yeh. Goin' my way?	[]

Cartman	14	1	I don't wanna die on this- bus with you assholes!  You guys suck!	['assholes']
Stan	21	0	Would you just relax? We've been in a lot worse situations than this and come out of it just fine.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Worse than this?	[]

Cartman	4	0	Oh, man, this sucks.	[]
Kyle	9	0	How come the visitors aren't coming for him.	[]

Stan	12	1	Cartman, there's an ice cream truck sticking out of your ass.	['ass']
Kyle	8	0	Hey, look. The aliens are getting ice cream.	[]
Stan	9	0	Wow! I guess everything's going to be okay.	[]
Wendy	1	0	Mmmm.	[]
Stan	9	0	Now, that was what I call a sticky situation.	[]

Kyle	9	0	Now, that's what I call a sticky situation.	[]
Stan	17	2	Okay, so we can agree that the monster outside can't be Scuzzlebutt, because Scuzzlebutt's nice.	['scuzzlebutt', 'scuzzlebutt']
Cartman	8	0	Hey. Maybe it's our teacher, Mr. Garrison.	[]
Kyle	19	0	Don't be stupid, Cartman. Our teacher wouldn't be out lying in the forest waiting to kill us!	[]
Cartman	18	0	Oh no? Don't you remember the time he went crazy, and tried to kill Kathie Lee Gifford?	[]

Kenny	11	0	(Heheheh. Now that's what I-he call a sticky situation!)	[]

Truck Driver	3	0	Are you sure?	[]
Ms. Crabtree	11	0	Ah-I'm sure. Let's get a cup of coffee.	[]
Cartman	12	0	I wonder when the monster is gonna come back to feed again?	[]
