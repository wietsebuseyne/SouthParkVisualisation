Mr. Mackey	75	4	Okay.  Now, uh, as your counselor, I'm here to tell you about drugs and alcohol and why they're bad, m'kay? Uh, so, first of all, uh, smokin's bad.  You shouldn't smoke. And-uh, alcohol is bad.  You shouldn't drink alcohol. And-uh, as for drugs, well, drugs are bad. You shouldn't do drugs. Okay, that about wraps up my introduction, now uh, are there any questions?  Yes, Stan?	['drugs', 'drugs', 'drugs', 'drugs']
Stan	6	0	Why do dogs have cold noses?	[]
Mr. Mackey	6	0	Uhhh, well, I'm not sure.	[]
Stan	1	0	Oh.	[]
Mr. Mackey	96	3	Now-uh, let's focus our discussion first on marijawana.  Marijawana's bad, and it also has a very distinct smell, okay? I'm gonna pass around just a little tiny bit. Now, I want you all to take a smell,  so you know when someone is smoking marijawana near you. M'kay, just take a smell, pass it on,  and when it gets back up to me,  we'll finish talking about it. In the meantime, I want to get into alcohol a little, okay? Uh, alcohol is bad. Uh, if you drink alcohol you...	['marijawana', 'marijawana', 'marijawana']
Kyle	12	0	Hey, are you guys gonna come to Ike's party this weekend?	[]

Cartman	8	1	Oh, kick ass! I wanna have a bris!	['ass']
Mr. Mackey	46	4	...and so uh, that's why alcohol is bad. Uh, ha-has that marijawana made it back up here yet?  No? O-okay. Let's talk about LSD.  Uh, children, LSD i-is bad. It's a drug made famous by John Lennon and Paul McCartney...	['marijawana', 'lsd', 'lsd', 'drug']
Stan	13	0	Hey, are we supposed to get your little brother presents for a bris?	[]

Principal Victoria	23	0	I am very disappointed in you, young man. You should be ashamed of yourself. What could have possessed you to be so stupid?	[]
Mr. Mackey	5	0	I'm sorry, Prinshipal Victoria.	[]
Principal Victoria	26	1	We-hell, sorry isn't going to cut the cheese this time, mister! I'm afraid I'm going to have to suspend you from school.	['hell']
Mr. Mackey	5	0	You mean I'm fired?	[]
Principal Victoria	13	0	Well, I guess that's the grown-up way to put it, yes.	[]
Mr. Mackey	27	1	But-but it was an honest error of judgment, m'kay? I-I really thought it was important for the kids to know the smell of marijawana--	['marijawana']
Principal Victoria	31	0	It was an error of judgment, Mr. Mackey, but I'm afraid I have to let you go for it. We searched each one of those kids, but came up empty.	[]
Mr. Mackey	1	0	But--	[]
Principal Victoria	22	0	We had to let them go home, and one of them now has half a lid of Jamaican grass because of you!	[]
Mr. Mackey	19	0	Huh, how am I going to make ends meet...m-m'kay? Wha-what will I do for money??	[]
Principal Victoria	28	0	There, there, now. Maybe this will all blow over someday and we can give you a job as a janitor cleaning up vomit with that pink sawdust stuff.	[]
Mr. Mackey	8	0	No-uho-uho-uho!  Not o-uho-uhokay!	[]
Stan	5	0	Man! That sucked, getting searched.	[]
Cartman	6	1	Yeah, my ass is killing me.	['ass']

Stan	7	0	No, dude, we never even saw it!	[]
Chef	12	1	Okay. Because I just want to tell you that drugs are bad!	['drugs']
Stan	9	0	We know, we know, that's what everybody says.	[]
Chef	9	0	Right. But do you know why they're bad?	[]
Kyle	24	0	Because they're an addictive solution to a greater problem, causing disease of both body and mind with consequences far outweighing their supposed benefits.	[]
Chef	9	0	And do you have any idea what that means?	[]
Kyle	1	0	No.	[]
Cartman	17	2	I know. Drugs are bad because if you do drugs, you're a hippie, and hippies suck.	['drugs', 'drugs']
Chef	32	1	Look, children. This is all I'm goin' to say about drugs: stay away from them. There's a time and place for everything, and it's called college. Do you understand?	['drugs']
Boys	1	0	Dude!	[]

Chef	2	0	A fireman?	[]
Cartman	14	0	That's the proper way to say it, or else you get a spanking.	[]
Chef	23	1	Dammit, children! Why do I always have to be the one to explain all this stuff to you?  Ask your parents for once!	['dammit']

Mr. Mackey	7	0	No, I lost my job before that.	[]
Social Worker	48	2	Mr. Mackey, you're supposed to be an adult.  The problem with drugs is that people forget to stop doing them. There's a time and a place for everything, Mr. Mackey, and it's called college! Now, I want you to repeat after me: Drugs are bad.	['drugs', 'drugs']

Stan	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Kyle	21	0	And that's why I feel like you guys are more than just friends. You're my family.  Except for Cartman.	[]
