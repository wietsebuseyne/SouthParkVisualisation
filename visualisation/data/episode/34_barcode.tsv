Cartman	6	0	Mom, please can we just leave?	[]
Liane	8	0	You have to see the eye doctor, Eric.	[]
Cartman	15	1	But I hate the eye doctor. He always makes fun of me for being fat.	['fat']
Liane	8	1	You're not fat, you're big-boned.	['fat']
Cartman	13	0	That's what I told him, but he doesn't listen to reason.	[]
Doctor's assistant	2	0	Eric Cartman.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Weak.	[]
Optometrist	2	0	Hello, Eric.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Hi, Doctor Lout.	[]
Dr. Lott	6	0	How's my little piggy today?	[]
Cartman	8	0	Ey! Don't call me a little piggy!	[]
Dr. Lott	10	0	I just say that because you're my little buddy.	[]
Cartman	16	1	I'm just here for an eye exam, all right?! Keep the fat jokes to yourself!	['fat']
Dr. Lott	10	0	Hop up on the chair.  Don't break it now!	[]
Cartman	3	1	God damn it!	['damn']
Dr. Lott	24	0	Just kidding. Let's see how your eyes are doing.  All you have to do is read the letters. Can you see the letters?	[]
Cartman	1	0	Yes.	[]
Dr. Lott	7	0	All right, read them out for me.	[]
Cartman	10	0	I am a little piggy. Ey!  That does it! Mom!	[]
Dr. Lott	38	0	No no. That, that was just a weird coincidence.  I do not know how that happened.  I am a little piggy. Wow! What are the odds of that?  All right, let's get down to business, shall we?	[]
Cartman	17	0	Oh gee! That's a good idea! My mom isn't paying you to be a comedian!	[]
Dr. Lott	13	0	Hmm, let's see, which is better: one, or two? One, or two?	[]

Dr. Lott	6	0	One, or two? One, or two?	[]
Cartman	1	0	Two.	[]
Dr. Lott	7	0	No! The answer is one, piggy! One!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Ow! I hate you!	[]
Dr. Lott	20	0	Yes, there is obviously a problem with your eyes. I am gonna have to dilate them and run some tests.	[]
Kyle	10	0	I wonder how come Cartman's not in school today?	[]
Stan	12	0	Yeah. Usually when he ditches school, he still shows up for lunch.	[]
Kenny	8	0	{Maybe he took a dump and got sick.}	[]
Kyle	5	0	Yeah.  Oh, here he comes.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Hey dudes.	[]
Stan	7	0	Whoa, what happened to your eyes, Cartman?	[]
Cartman	8	1	My asshole eye doctor made them all dilevated.	['asshole']
Kyle	1	0	Why?	[]
Cartman	18	2	Why? I'll tell you why! Because he's a God-damned asshole, aaand, that's about it!	['damned', 'asshole']
Stan	9	0	Why do you have to see an eye doctor?	[]
Cartman	28	0	Because my eyes suck. But that doctor likes to torture me and I have to go back tomorrow, and I don't know what I'm gonna do.	[]
Kyle	12	0	Dude, just ask Chef for help. He always knows what to do.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Hey, yeah!  Ow!	[]
The Boys	2	0	Hey Chef!	[]
White Chef	3	0	Hello there, children.	[]
Cartman	15	0	Dude, my eyes are seriously screwed up. Chef looks like a skinny little white guy.	[]
White Chef	7	0	It's time for lunch-e-roo	[]
Stan	3	0	Where's Chef?	[]
White Chef	2	0	Chef quit.	[]
The Boys	1	0	What?!	[]
White Chef	15	0	Chef is gone. So let my introduce myself. I'm your new cook, Mr. Derp.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Mr. Derp?	[]
Mr. Derp	35	0	When I'm in the kitchen, you never know what nutty things are gonna happen. If you like Chef, you're gonna love Mr. Derp.  Ooo! Derp!  Derp! O-hoh wasn't that silly kids?	[]
Stan	4	0	Why did Chef quit?	[]
Mr. Derp	22	0	Aren't I a great character? My antics go right to the funny bone.  Oh, I don't feel so good.  Derp!	[]
Stan	8	0	Could you just hand us some food please?	[]
Mr. Derp	11	0	Sure gang! I have yellow stuff or white stuff, huh. Derp!	[]
Cartman	10	0	Can I have the yellow with a side of white?	[]
Kyle	5	0	Dude! I hate Mr. Derp!	[]
Stan	14	0	Yeah, we gotta talk to Chef after school and get him to come back.	[]
Cartman	12	0	I don't know, you guys. That hammer thing was pretty funny.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Shut up, Cartman!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Ow!	[]
Chef	4	0	Oh! Hello there, children!	[]
Stan	15	1	Chef, what the hell are you doing? We almost starved to death at lunch today.	['hell']
Chef	8	0	Oh! Didn't they tell you? I quit.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Yeah, but we didn't believe them.	[]
Chef	4	0	Well, it's true.	[]
Stan	6	0	But why? Why would you quit?	[]
Chef	49	0	Children, three nights ago I was at the library checking out some books on Kama Sutra when I met the most amazing woman ever. She knew so much about so many things. She really got me thinking. We eventually came back to my place and really hit it off.	[]
Stan	11	0	So you made sweet love to her down by the fire.	[]
Chef	11	0	No no, we just sat there all night long and... taaalked.	[]
Stan	1	0	Talked?!	[]
Chef	34	1	Yeah. She told me all about the powers of goddess, and how men have been oppressing women for years  and viewing them as sexual objects, and I realized that I had done that myself.	['sexual']
Woman	5	0	Oh! What darling little children.	[]
Chef	10	0	Here she is now. Children, meet my new girlfriend, Veronica.	[]
Stan	15	0	That's nice. Look Chef, Cartman's got this eye doctor, see, and he- Girlfriend?!	[]
Chef	7	0	Children, Veronica is moving in with me.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Moving in?!	[]
Chef	4	0	I'm in love.	[]
Boys	1	0	Love?!	[]
Veronica	3	0	Oh, you knight.	[]
Stan	6	1	What the hell is going on?!	['hell']
Chef	11	0	Veronica spent the whole day sharing her favorite poems with me.	[]
Veronica	11	0	Sorry boys, looks like I'm stealing Chef away from you.	[]
Kyle	21	0	But Chef always helps us with our problems. When we have a problem, Chef sings to us and makes it better.	[]
Chef	19	0	Well, I can still do that, children. In fact, Veronica can help me. She's a great singer, too.	[]
Veronica	4	0	What's the problem?	[]
Cartman	17	0	My eyes are going bad, but the only eye doctor in South Park is really, really mean.	[]
Veronica	24	0	Oh, I know just the song for you. There's got to be a morning after if we can hold on to the night	[]
Chef	8	0	We have a chance to find the sunshine.	[]
"Chef, Veronica"	8	0	Let's keep on looking for the light.	[]
Kyle	3	0	This... is insane.	[]
Kyle	2	1	That bitch!	['bitch']
Stan	6	0	She's stealing Chef from us.	[]
Kyle	16	0	He didn't even seem like Chef. He seemed like a empty shell of a man.	[]
Cartman	23	1	Maybe it's just a phase. We just have to get him alone so we can tell him what a bitch she is.	['bitch']
Stan	26	0	Wait you guys.  Maybe, is it possible that we're just jealous because Chef is our friend, and now he's paying attention to somebody new?	[]
Kyle	2	0	Yeah, so?	[]
Stan	4	1	...Yeah, screw that bitch.	['bitch']
Cartman	5	2	Bitch, I hate that bitch!	['bitch', 'bitch']
Kyle	18	0	Look, we've just gotta get Chef alone. He won't listen to reason with that hooker around.	[]
Stan	14	0	Let's find out where he's working and go see him there tomorrow.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Good idea.	[]
Dr. Lott	9	0	All right, we got the test results back, piggy-	[]
Cartman	4	0	Stop calling me piggy!	[]
Dr. Lott	12	0	You've got a small astigmatism that's causing all the problems.	[]
Cartman	5	0	So, what does that mean?	[]
Dr. Lott	12	0	It means, piggy, that your eyesight is never going to get better.	[]
Cartman	39	2	All right. Right now, I'm gonna be totally serious, dude. Okay? If you call me piggy one more time, I'm gonna leap out of this chair  and rip your god-damned nuts off with my bare hands!	['damned', 'nuts']
Dr. Lott	19	0	Well, don't worry. I've got something that's going to make your eyes as good as new.	[]
Cartman	16	0	Oh, dude! Super weak! I'm not wearing these; the guys would totally rip on me.	[]
Dr. Lott	14	0	I know, the hardest thing to do is get kids to wear their glasses.	[]
Cartman	12	0	I'm just gonna take them off as soon as I leave!	[]
Dr. Lott	8	0	That's why we have the little stapler.	[]
Cartman	5	1	Ow! Son of a bitch!	['bitch']
Kyle	10	0	They said that Chef works in one of these buildings	[]
Cartman	17	0	Hey dudes.  Ha ha ha ha! Look at Cartman and his stupid glasses! Ha ha ha ha!	[]
Kyle	5	0	Dude! Just take them off!	[]
Cartman	13	0	I can't! They're stapled to my head!  I hate you guys.	[]
Receptionist	10	0	Hello and welcome to Steinburg & Burgstein. Can I help you?	[]
Stan	5	0	We wanna talk to Chef.	[]
Receptionist	1	0	Chef?	[]

Stan	4	0	And a chef hat.	[]

Receptionist	4	0	Oh! The black guy!	[]
Stan	1	0	Huh?	[]
Receptionist	16	0	Third cubicle on the left  Hey! Aren't you that cute little kid from Jerry Maguire?	[]
Cartman	4	0	Uh, yeah, sure sure.	[]
Receptionist	5	1	Wow! You really got fat.	['fat']
Cartman	1	0	Ey!	[]
Chef	3	0	Hello there, children.	[]
Kids	2	0	Hey, Chef.	[]
Chef	4	0	Eric, you got glasses!	[]
Stan	7	1	Chef, you have to dump the bitch!	['bitch']
Chef	1	0	Huh?	[]
Kyle	4	0	We need you, Chef.	[]
Man	24	0	Hey, Chef-o, we're gonna run down to the office supply store and get some leather holders for our pagers, you wanna come?	[]
Chef	2	0	You bet!	[]
Kyle	6	0	Chef, this place isn't you!	[]
Chef	30	1	Children, Veronica showed me that I've been living a very empty life. Meaningless sex is fun for twenty or thirty years, but after that, it starts to get old.	['sex']
Stan	6	0	But we don't like her.	[]
Chef	2	0	Why not??	[]
Stan	9	0	I don't know-uh. No reason I guess.	[]
Chef	21	0	Children, friends get girlfriends all the time. It's something even you will have to face with each other some day.	[]
Kyle	3	0	No way, dude!	[]
Cartman	13	0	Please, Chef! I don't know what to do about my stupid glasses.	[]
Chef	13	0	That's easy! Get some laser corrective surgery. That's what I did.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Hey! Laser corrective surgery! Thanks Chef!	[]
Chef	21	0	You see? Everything's gonna be fine. Now how about I meet you boys after work and we can play ball?	[]
Kids	1	0	Okay!	[]
Kyle	6	0	Chef should be here any minute.	[]
Stan	5	0	Dude! He bailed on us!	[]
Kyle	5	0	I can't believe it!	[]
Stan	8	0	Come on! We're going to his house!	[]
Chef	5	0	Oh! Uh, hello there, children.	[]
Kyle	19	0	All right, mister! You better have a good explanation for why you didn't show up to play ball!	[]
Chef	7	0	Oh, children, I'm sorry. I forgot.	[]
Stan	2	0	You forgot!	[]
Chef	16	0	Veronica surprised me at the office and took me out to dinner.  She's so amazing.	[]
Kyle	11	0	Well, we've got something to tell you about Veronica, Chef!	[]
Veronica	2	0	Hello, children!	[]
Cartman	14	0	Ma'am, we're having a dude moment here, if you don't mind?	[]
Chef	15	0	Children, I've got some great news for you. Veronica and I are getting married.	[]
Stan	4	0	Oh no! No nononononono!	[]
Chef	17	0	My whole family's coming here for the wedding, and I want you boys to come, too.	[]
Veronica	15	0	This is so wonderful! Let's sing!  There's got to be a morning after.	[]
Chef	16	0	If we can hold on through the night. We have a chance to find the sunshine.	[]
Mr. Garrison	51	0	And that, children, is what you need to know about The Facts Of Life. So, let's review.  Tootie left in the fourth season, but Blair and Jo stayed on and got husbands, leaving the fifth and sixth seasons hideously stagnant.  Okay children, that's lunch. See you in thirty minutes.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Mr. Garrison, can we talk to you?	[]
Mr. Garrison	1	0	Sure.	[]
Stan	15	0	Normally we go to Chef with our problems, but wuh we can't this time.	[]
Mr. Garrison	25	0	Well children, I am your teacher. I think you'll find that my advice is just as valuable as Chef's, if not more so.	[]
Kyle	26	0	All right. Mr. Garrison, have you ever had a friend who got a new girlfriend, and then stopped being your friend, and it pissed you off?	[]
Mr. Garrison	5	0	Oh, the old succubus syndrome.	[]
Stan	4	0	What's a succubus?	[]
Mr. Garrison	16	1	A succubus is a woman sent from Hell to suck the life out of a man.	['hell']
Kyle	3	0	That's it!	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Mr. Garrison	19	0	Yeah, there's not much you can do about a succubus. Their evil power makes man blind to love.	[]
Kyle	6	0	This is totally what's happening!	[]
Stan	6	0	Wow, you are smart, Mr. Garrison!	[]
Mr. Garrison	41	0	Yeah, I tell you boys, women can kill. Poontang's expensive. That's why when it comes to chicks, I just screw them and leave them. I'd say get out of my bedroom, poontang, before you suck my life dry!	[]
Kyle	3	0	Thanks, Mr. Garrison.	[]
Mr. Garrison	2	0	Sure, kids.	[]
Mr. Hat	5	0	You're not fooling anyone!	[]
Mr. Garrison	5	0	Shut your hole, Mr. Hat!	[]
Kyle	15	0	Come on guys! We gotta go tell Chef he's in love with a succubus.	[]
Stan	10	0	Yeah! He's gonna be so thankful we told him.	[]
Liane	14	0	There you are, Eric! Come on, we have to go to the eye doctor.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Oh, no!	[]
Liane	11	0	Come on. Do you want your laser corrective surgery or not?	[]
Cartman	8	0	Yes, but can't we wait until tomorrow.	[]
Liane	2	0	Now, hon.	[]
Cartman	14	0	But mo-om! I have to tell Chef that he's marrying a succubuuus!	[]
Chef's dad	3	0	Hello there, children.	[]
Stan	3	0	Who are you?	[]
Chef's dad	12	0	I'm Chef's father. We just flew in for the wedding.	[]
Kyle	11	0	Oh, hi. Is Chef here? We have to talk to him.	[]
Chef's dad	4	0	Well, come on in.	[]
Kyle	3	0	There he is!	[]
Stan	7	0	Chef, we have to talk to you!	[]
Chef	14	1	Who? Not now, children! I gotta get fitted for my britches! Be right back.	['britches']
Chef's dad	10	1	Well, aren't you crackers just cute as the dickens?	['dickens']
Stan	5	0	You're Chef's parents?	[]
Chef's mom	4	0	Yes, all his life.	[]
Kyle	6	0	We have to talk to him!	[]
Chef's dad	7	0	Well, he should be out now directly.	[]
Chef's mom	9	0	Oh, he's so excited about the wedding now.	[]
Chef's dad	16	0	Say, would you crackers like to hear about the time we saw the Loch Ness monster?	[]
Stan	4	0	No, that's okay.	[]
Chef's dad	46	0	Ooh, it must've been about seven, eight years ago. Me and the little lady was out on this boat, you see, all alone at night, when all of a sudden this huge creature, this giant crustacean from the paleolithic era, comes out of the water.	[]
Chef's mom	23	0	We was so scared, Lord have mercy, I jumped up in the boat and I said Thomas, what on earth is that creature?!	[]
Thomas	11	0	It stood above us looking down with these big red eyes,-	[]
Chef's mom	5	0	Oh, it was so scary!	[]
Thomas	25	0	and I yelled. I said, What do you want from us, monster?! And the monster bent down and said, ...Uh I need about tree-fitty.	[]
Kyle	4	0	What's tree-fitty?	[]
Thomas	5	0	Three dollars and fifty cents.	[]
Chef's mom	2	0	Tree-fitty.	[]
Stan	3	0	He wanted money?	[]
Thomas	23	2	That's right. I said I ain't giving you no tree-fitty you goddamn Loch Ness monster! Get your own goddamn money!	['goddamn', 'goddamn']
Chef's mom	5	0	I gave him a dollar.	[]
Thomas	5	0	She gave him a dollar.	[]
Chef's mom	12	0	I thought he'd go away if I gave him a dollar.	[]
Thomas	22	0	Well of course he's not gonna go away, Nellie! You give him a dollar, he's gonna assume you got more!	[]
Dr. Lott	12	0	Okay, let's get started. You're here for the liposuction, right?	[]
Cartman	6	1	Hey! You son of a bitch!	['bitch']
Dr. Lott	9	0	All right. Time to laser me a little piggy.	[]
Cartman	21	1	Ey! You son of a bitch! I'm gonna kick you square in the nuh-  I'm gonyanya, uhnyuh, uhnyuuh, nyaahh	['bitch']
Dr. Lott	9	0	I bet his mom wishes she could do that.	[]
Thomas	20	0	And that was the third time we saw the Loch Ness monster. Then one time, I believe it was July-	[]
Nellie	1	0	August.	[]
Thomas	19	0	August. There's a knock on the door. I open it, and there's this cute little girl scout-	[]
Nellie	12	0	And she was so adorable, with the little pig tails and all.	[]
Thomas	29	0	And she says to me, How would you like to buy some cookies? And I said Well, what kind do you have? She had thin mints, graham crunchy things-	[]
Nellie	2	0	Raisin oatmeal.	[]
Thomas	30	0	Raisin oatmeal, and I said We'll take a graham crunch. How much will that be? And she looks at me and she says, ...Uh I need about tree-fitty.	[]
Nellie	2	0	...Tree-fitty.	[]
Thomas	25	0	Well, it was about that time that I notice that girl scout was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the protozoic era.	[]
Nellie	4	0	The Loch Ness monster.	[]
Thomas	43	1	I said, Dammit monster! Get off my lawn! I ain't giving you no tree-fitty! It said, how about just two-fitty? I said, Oh, now it's only two-fitty!! What?! Is there a sale on Loch Ness munchies or something?!	['dammit']
Nellie	4	0	Lord, he was angry.	[]
Thomas	5	1	Damn right, I was angry!	['damn']
Nellie	11	1	Not you, the monster. He was about to kick your ass.	['ass']
Thomas	5	0	Aah, shut your mouth, woman!	[]
Stan	9	0	Uh, could you just tell Chef we were here?	[]
Thomas	13	0	Sure. That crazy old monster  Now, then the fourth time I saw the...	[]
Stan	7	1	Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!	['hell']
Cartman	18	1	That asshole eye doctor screwed up my laser surgery; I have to wear these bandages for three days!	['asshole']
Stan	7	1	Damn, your eyes must really suck, Cartman.	['damn']
Cartman	20	0	Oh, thanks for the news flash, Tom Brokaw! What happened with Chef? Did you tell him she's a succubus?	[]
Stan	20	0	Well, we couldn't even talk to him. She's so evil. She has him totally kept away from us.	[]
Liane	10	0	Eric, you have a little visitor. Is that all right?	[]
Cartman	1	0	Okay.	[]
Veronica	14	0	Hello, boys. I heard Eric had laser surgery, so I made him a pie.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Aaah! It's the succubus!	[]
Veronica	1	0	Huh?	[]
Stan	6	0	We know what you are, lady!	[]
Kyle	7	0	Yeah! You're a blood-thirsty succubus!	[]
Veronica	2	0	A what?	[]
Stan	12	1	A demon from Hell sent to suck the life out of men!	['hell']
Veronica	10	0	Boys, you know how silly that sounds, don't you?	[]
Kyle	7	0	Well, you are taking Chef from us.	[]
Veronica	44	0	Boys, come here. I want to explain this to you. I know Chef is your friend, but Chef is a grown man. He has needs you boys can't fulfill. He wants a life with me because I make him happy. Do you understand?	[]
Stan	2	0	I guess.	[]
Veronica	30	1	Good. Oh and boys. Just one more thing. I'm going to marry Chef tomorrow,  And there's not a God-damned thing you can do about it!  Toodle-oo!	['damned']
Stan	2	0	Jesus dude!	[]
Cartman	3	0	What? What happened?	[]
Thomas	37	0	Could I have your attention please?  Tomorrow, my son is gonna get married to a beautiful lady.  I'm very happy for them both.  Ooh there I go! I told myself I wasn't gonna cry, now.	[]
Chef	4	0	It's okay, pop.	[]
Nellie	8	0	Thomas, you're gonna get me going now.	[]
Thomas	52	0	Oh, I remember when Chef was just a three-year-old little man. He came running up to me with a big smile and his little chef's hat on, and he said, Poppa, poppa! I said What do you need, Chef, my boy?, and he said, ...I need about tree-fitty.	[]
Nellie	2	0	...Tree-fitty.	[]
Thomas	45	0	Well, it was about that time I got suspicious. I said, Chef, why do you need tree-fitty? He said, My imaginary friend Goo-Goo the dinosaur wants it. I went to my son's room, and sure enough, there was the Loch Ness monster!	[]
Nellie	4	0	Oh, it was scary!	[]
Thomas	25	1	I said, Dammit monster! You stop bugging my children now! We work for our money in this house and we don't give money away!	['dammit']
Stan	13	0	Excuse me!  We're sorry to interrupt, but we've got bad news.	[]
Kyle	9	0	This is not a woman! It is a succubus!	[]
Chef	1	0	What?!	[]
Stan	14	0	Yeah! She's evil and wants to suck Chef's life out of him	[]
Veronica	5	0	Children! That hurts my feelings.	[]
Kyle	12	0	Oh, you can pretend all you want! You're not fooling anybody!	[]
Chef	28	0	All right guys! That's enough! I have had it with you! This is the happiest time of my life, and you can't be happy for me!	[]
Stan	2	0	Chef, but-	[]
Chef	35	0	No buts, Stan!  I love this woman, and I am marrying her! Now you can either accept that, or get out of my life! Now if you'll excuse us, we're having a party.	[]
Thomas	10	0	So I chased the monster down the street, you see...	[]
Kyle	14	0	I guess there's nothing we can do. Chef likes her more than us.	[]
Stan	15	0	No! I'm not willing to give up! Chef wouldn't give up on us!	[]
Stan	16	0	Oh man! There's tons of stuff on succubuses, but nothing on how to stop them.	[]
Cartman	14	0	You guys, it's six in the morning, I have to get some sleep.	[]
Stan	22	0	Dude! Chef's wedding is in three hours. We've got that much time to find out how to destroy a Succubus.	[]
Cartman	21	0	You know what?! Screw Chef! There, I said it! Screw him! Let him marry a succubus! I wanna go to sleep.	[]
Kyle	31	0	Here! Here! Look at this. It says The succubus enchants its victim with an eerie melody. This is the Succubi power. Only playing this melody backwards can vanquish the succubus power.	[]
Stan	6	1	What the hell does that mean?	['hell']
Kyle	4	0	I don't know.	[]
Kenny	46	0	(Hey, you guys! You guys, I think I know precisely what it's saying. It says that we've gotta go and find a pile of records and get the one that has the entire lyrics, and then we gotta get into learning to rearrange them.)	[]
Stan	1	0	Right.	[]
Kenny	32	0	(And then we gotta go down and get a piece of paper and write down each one of the words we sang on the tape deck. And then, sing it back again!)	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah?	[]
Kenny	5	0	(That's what that means!)	[]
Stan	2	0	Oh-hoho!	[]
Kyle	17	0	Hey yeah! What's that song she always sings? There's got to be a morning after.	[]
Cartman	16	0	If we can hold on to the night. We've got to find our way together...	[]
Stan	9	0	That's it! We gotta learn that song backwards.	[]
Kyle	3	0	In three hours.	[]
Kyle	9	0	Ah man! I can't keep my eyes open.	[]
Stan	17	0	We can't fall asleep. We gotta nail that song.  You got the tape recorder, Cartman? Cartman??	[]
Kyle	6	0	He's asleep. Wake up fatass!	[]
Cartman	3	0	What what what?	[]

It can destroy like a typhoon wind!Just play it cool and don't be a fool...	[]
