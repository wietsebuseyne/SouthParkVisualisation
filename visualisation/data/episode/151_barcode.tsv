Cartman	13	0	Come ohhhn! Come ohhhn! Oh, for the love of God, how much longer?!	[]
Liane	9	0	There you are, Eric. What are you doing here?	[]
Cartman	11	0	I'm waiting for the new Nintendo Wii to come out.	[]
Liane	5	0	When does it come out?	[]
Cartman	7	0	Three weeks. Come ohhhn! C-Come ohhhn!	[]
Liane	5	0	It's time for school	[]
Cartman	35	0	No Mom, you don't understand! I've been waiting for this thing to come out for months. And now, every day time is slowing down. It's like... waiting for Christmas... times a thousand.	[]
Liane	10	0	Eric, you're just going to have to be patient.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Noo!! Nooo!!	[]
Mrs. Garrison	37	0	Principal Victoria, it is wrong!  It is wrong and I simply will not do it!  I care about my students, and I will not fill their heads with lies!  I am NOT teaching evolution in my class!!	[]
Principal Victoria	13	0	Mrs. Garrison, evolution is in the school curriculum. We have to teach it.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	23	0	Evolution is a theory! A hare-brained theory that says I'm a monkey! I am not a monkey!! I'm a woman!	[]
Mr. Mackey	13	0	M, m'kay. Ya-you realize evolution has been pretty much uhhh... proven.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	14	0	I warn you, Principal Victoria! Those students are not prepared to hear this stuff!	[]
Principal Victoria	15	0	Our students want to learn, Mrs. Garrison, and they're mature enough to handle anything.	[]
Cartman	8	0	How long until Nintendo Wii comes out now?!	[]
Stan	5	0	It's still three weeks.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Oh God...  Okay, how long now?	[]
Kyle	5	0	Will you shut up already?!	[]
Mrs. Garrison	15	0	All right kids, it is now my job to teach you the theory of evolution.	[]
Butters	2	0	Oh boy!	[]
Mrs. Garrison	177	16	Now I, for one, think evolution is a bunch of BULL CRAP. But I've been told I have to teach it anyway. It was thought up by Charles Darwin and it goes something like this:  In the beginning we were all fish. Okay? Swimming around in the water. And then one day a couple of fish had a retard baby, and the retard baby was different, so it got to live. So Retard Fish goes on to make more retard babies, and then one day, a retard baby fish crawled out of the ocean with its  mutant fish hands... and it had butt sex with a squirrel or something and made this.  retard frog squirrel, and then that had a retard baby which was a... monkey fish-frog... And then this monkey fish-frog had butt sex with that monkey, and... that monkey had a mutant retard baby that screwed another monkey and... that made you!  So there you go! You're the retarded offspring of five monkeys having butt sex with a fish-squirrel! Congratulations!

Cartman	8	0	HEHHH! I can't take it anymore! HAAAAAH!	[]
Mrs. Garrison	8	0	Yeah? You see? I knew that would happen.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Come ohhhn! C-Come ohhhn!	[]
Clerk	21	0	Look, kid, for the fortieth time, pacing in front of the store isn't gonna make the Wii come any faster.	[]
Liane	7	0	Eric, you're coming home right now!	[]
Cartman	13	0	Can't I just stay and... look at the sign a little longer?	[]
Liane	13	0	It's almost bedtime. If you sleep then time'll go by faster.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Oh God!	[]
Cartman	10	0	Agh! That does it!! I am not waiting three weeks!!	[]
Cartman	10	0	You guys! You guys! You guys, you gotta help me.	[]
Stan	8	0	Dude you don't look so good, Cartman.	[]
Cartman	17	0	I can't take it anymore, you guys. The wait for Nintendo Wii is literally killing me.	[]
Kyle	14	0	Well there's nothing you can do, so you just have to be patient.	[]
Cartman	7	0	No. There is something I can do.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(What?)	[]
Cartman	32	0	All right, listen: you know how in space movies they put astronauts in suspender animation so that their trip seems really short, right?  I think I figured out how to do it.	[]
Stan	2	0	Do what?	[]
Cartman	27	0	Freeze myself. If I freeze myself, then in three weeks, when Nintendo Wii comes out, you guys can unfreeze me. The wait will seem instantaneous to me.	[]
Kyle	1	0	No.	[]
Cartman	5	0	It's simple science, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	4	1	You'll die, retard!	['retard']
Cartman	19	0	I'll die waiting for the Wii to come out!! Don't you see this is my only chance!!	[]
Stan	3	0	Dude, no way.	[]
Kyle	13	0	Yeah, I hate you, but I'm not going to help kill you.	[]
Cartman	27	0	I thought you were my friends! I guess I was wrong! After everything we've been through together, you guys won't even help me freeze myself!	[]
Father	24	1	Principal Victoria, we are a devout Catholic family! Do you mind telling me why my daughter now thinks she's a retarded fish-frog?!	['retarded']
Mrs. Garrsion	9	0	I told you this would happen, didn't I?!	[]
Principal Victoria	7	0	Mr. Triscotti, I wasn't aware that-	[]
Mr. Triscotti	26	0	We have worked years to instill the teachings of Jesus Christ into our daughter, and in one fell swoop, you try to destroy everything we did!	[]
Mrs. Garrsion	3	0	I hear ya.	[]
Principal Victoria	20	0	Sir, if you don't wish your daughter to learn about evolution, then we can pull her out of class.	[]
Mr. Triscotti	4	0	You most certainly will!	[]
Daughter	7	0	But Dad, I want to learn everything.	[]
Mr. Triscotti	6	0	No you don't! Shut up!	[]
Mrs. Garrsion	12	0	Well, I told you. We should leave evolution out of the classrooms.	[]
Principal Victoria	24	0	It has become obvious to me that you don't know enough about evolution to teach it! I'm having you replaced! Mr. Dawkins!	[]
Mrs. Garrsion	2	0	Re-replaced??	[]
Principal Victoria	8	0	Richard Dawkins is a world-renowned evolutionary scientist.	[]
Mr. Dawkins	5	0	Charmed to meet you. Ms...	[]
Mrs. Garrsion	11	1	Shut up, faggot! Principal Victoria, I can teach my own class!	['faggot']
Principal Victoria	14	0	You are to sit in class and help Mr. Dawkins with whatever he needs!	[]
Mr. Dawkins	21	0	Over billions of years life has evolved from simple one-celled organisms into all the complex life we see around us.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	1	0	Whatever.	[]
Mr. Dawkins	16	0	It was changes in hereditary traits that allowed the first mammals to breath in the air.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	3	1	Retarded fish-frogs.	['retarded']
Mr. Dawkins	10	0	Ms. Garrision, I believe that's a gross over-simplification.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	6	1	Well, you're a faggot!  Continue.	['faggot']
Mr. Dawkins	22	0	You see, children, life has the amazing ability to change, to adapt. Like changing us to the point that we walk upright.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	11	0	So you are saying that we're all related to monkeys.	[]
Mr. Dawkins	5	0	Well yes, basically, we are.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	17	1	Do you see monkeys at the zoo?! They crap in their hands and throw it at people!	['crap']
Mr. Dawkins	10	0	Ms. Garrison, this isn't theory, it is scientific fact!	[]
Mrs. Garrison	24	2	What about the fact that if I believe in this crap, you're gonna go to hell?! Doesn't that bother you a little?	['crap', 'hell']
Mr. Dawkins	7	0	Actually, no. Because I'm an atheist.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	14	0	AHA! I've got you, you snake in the grass!! I found you out!!	[]
Mr. Dawkins	5	0	I never covered it up.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	16	0	And if I'm a monkey, then I might as well act like a monkey, huh?!	[]
Mr. Dawkins	6	0	What on earth are you doing??	[]
Mrs. Garrison	9	1	Don't ask me, I'm a fuckin' monkey!!	['fuckin']
Mr. Dawkins	1	0	AAAH!	[]
Mrs. Garrison	20	0	Principal Victoria, I was simply trying to make a point to Mr. Dawkins about the incongruity of some scientific statements.	[]
Principal Victoria	10	0	Mrs. Garrison, I am pulling you out of the classroom.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	1	0	What??	[]
Mr. Dawkins	22	0	Principal Victoria, I really don't think that's necessary. This woman is very opinionated but, she does care about her students.	[]
Principal Victoria	13	0	Very well. But there is to be no more throwing of feces. Understood??	[]
Mr. Dawkins	12	0	Ms. Garrison. Ms. Garrison, could I have a word with you, please?	[]
Mrs. Garrison	1	0	What?!	[]
Mr. Dawkins	19	0	Look, I know you think we're at war, but I want you to know I admire your passion.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	4	0	You d-you do?	[]
Mr. Dawkins	10	0	I've never met a woman with so much... fire	[]
Mrs. Garrison	13	0	Well I...  I do bring down a woman's wrath now and again.	[]
Mr. Dawkins	20	0	So much boldness in a woman. So beautiful.  I'm sorry, I'm sure you have a husband, but I-	[]
Mrs. Garrison	10	0	No! N-no! My, my husband is g-gone, dead.	[]
Mr. Dawkins	9	0	Would you then... consider having dinner with me tonight?	[]
Mrs. Garrison	12	0	Well,  well, I suppose we could have a little steak or something.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	31	1	I've got a date! I've got a date! My first real date with a real man since my sex-change operation!  Oh boy, what'll I wear?!  Hey everybody!	['sex']
Cartman	1	0	Ey!	[]
Liane	1	0	Whoa!	[]
Cartman	8	0	Close the door, I'm trying to freeze!	[]
Liane	5	0	Eric, get out of there.	[]
Cartman	6	0	No! No, it's too soon!	[]
Liane	14	0	Now Eric, this has gone far enough!  You need to learn to be patient!	[]
Cartman	7	0	Butters, get your coat. We gotta go.	[]
Butters	2	0	Go where?	[]
Cartman	7	0	You're gonna help me freeze myself.	[]
Butters	1	0	Okay.	[]
Butters	12	0	Well, how come we've gotta come all the way out here?	[]
Cartman	49	0	Butters, if anyone else comes upon my frozen body, they'll try to unfreeze me right away.  I have to be hidden.  That's good.  And no matter what happens, Butters, you are not to unfreeze me until the day the Nintendo Wii comes out. Do you got it?!	[]
Butters	9	0	Eric, are you sure this is a good idea?	[]
Cartman	12	0	No, it's not a good idea. It's an awesome idea	[]
Butters	5	0	Yeah...I guess it is...	[]
Cartman	17	0	All right, you got the spot figured out? You're not gonna lose where I am, right?	[]
Butters	7	0	I got it.  Big Tree. Oval Rock.	[]
Cartman	29	1	All right, now get out of here. You can't freeze too, or else we're both screwed.  Get out of here, you asshole! You're gonna ruin everything!	['asshole']
Butters	2	0	Oh jeez!	[]
Cartman	5	0	Yes. Come on. Freeeze. Freeeze.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	18	1	So I told my gynecologist, you put so many things in my vagina, maybe I should charge you!	['vagina']
Mr. Dawkins	23	0	Oh, Garrison. Ms, you are the most outspoken woman I have ever met! It's almost like you're one of the guys.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	2	0	Hehyeah, almost.	[]
Mr. Dawkins	14	1	You have so much spunk, so much life... If only you were an atheist.	['spunk']
Mrs. Garrison	11	0	Well... Well, you know, I'm... I'm open to stuff.	[]
Mr. Dawkins	15	0	Why is someone as outspoken as you given themselves over to the whole God thing?	[]
Mrs. Garrison	25	0	Oh I'm not... I'm not totally into the whole God thing. I just... I just think, you know, you can't disprove God.	[]
Mr. Dawkins	23	0	Well what if I told you there was a flying spaghetti monster: Would you believe it simply because it can't be disproven?	[]
Mrs. Garrison	26	0	You're riiight. It's so simple! God is a spaghetti monster. Oh thank you, jeez! My eyes are opened!  Hey everyone, I'm an atheist!	[]
Mr. Dawkins	5	0	Really?? Oh that's wonderful!	[]
Mrs. Garrison	27	0	No, I totally get it now! Evolution explains everything! There is no great mystery to life, just evolution and God's a spaghetti monster! Thank you, Richard!	[]
Mr. Dawkins	4	0	You're so welcome!	[]
Mrs. Garrison	11	0	Would you like tuh...  head over to my place for dessert?	[]
Mrs. Garrison	13	0	Oh yeah! Yeah, I'm a monkey! Give this monkey what she wants!	[]
Mr. Dawkins	3	0	Oh Ms. Garrison!	[]
Mrs. Garrison	13	0	Yeah, pound my monkey hole, Richard! Yeah, I'm a monkey all right!	[]
Cartman	12	0	Nin-ten-do. I'm coming. I'm coming, Nin-ten-do.	[]
Medic	4	0	We have a pulse.	[]
Alien 1	4	0	Can you... understand me?	[]
Cartman	3	0	Where am I?	[]
Shvek	7	0	My name is Shvek. You are safe.	[]
Cartman	3	1	Safe where, butthole?!	['butthole']
Shvek	18	0	My friend, this is going to be a bit of a shock, but... it is the year 2546.	[]
Cartman	1	0	What??	[]
Shvek	15	1	You have been frozen in ice for over 500 years.  Butters? Butters, you black asshole?!	['asshole']
Medic	6	0	Please be careful. You are frail.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Is the Wii out? Where's the Wii?	[]
Analyst	11	0	Ahh, Nintendo Wii. A primitive gaming device used in his time.	[]
Cartman	7	1	Primitive? It has motion-control controllers, asswipe!	['asswipe']
Medic	22	0	Young man, you don't seem to understand.  Your family, your friends, everyone you knew, has been dead for over 500 years.	[]
Cartman	9	0	I don't care! Is there a Nintendo Wii!	[]
Shvek	17	0	We don't play videogames in our time. There's no such thing as a Nintendo Wii.	[]
Cartman	2	0	No...  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!	[]
Mr. Dawkins	13	0	You must understand, children, that we are dealing with VERY large numbers here.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	4	0	That's my man.	[]
Mr. Dawkins	15	0	So, evolution doesn't even happen by chance. It is, in fact, bound to happen.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	12	0	That's right, kids. And so you see, there is no God.	[]
Mr. Dawkins	11	0	Careful darling. The school board doesn't like it when we-	[]
Stan	7	0	Well there could still be a god.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	1	0	What?!	[]
Stan	14	0	Couldn't evolution be the answer to how and not the answer to why?	[]
Mrs. Garrison	17	2	Uh oh, retard alert! Retard alert, class!  Do you believe in a flying spaghetti monster too, bubblehead?!	['retard', 'retard']
Stan	6	0	I wasn't talking about spaghetti.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	13	0	Come on, you. You're gonna have to sit in the dunce chair!	[]
Mr. Dawkins	15	0	Ms. Garrison, I'm not so sure what you did in class today was right.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	15	1	What?? But Dick, you told me the world would be a better place without religion.	['dick']
Mr. Dawkins	18	1	Yes, but to be so bold about it...  I've just never seen a woman with such... balls.	['balls']
Mrs. Garrison	30	1	You've just been too soft on religious people in the past. Think about it, Richard. With your intellect and my balls, we can change the future of the world.	['balls']
Mr. Dawkins	26	1	Can you imagine a world with no religion? No Muslims killing Jews, no Christians bombing abortion clinics. The world would be a wonderful place... without God.	['jews']
Mrs. Garrison	18	1	You're the smartest man on earth, Dick. With me by your side, there's no stopping you.	['dick']
Mr. Dawkins	9	0	Oh, just let me see those beautiful breasts again.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	3	0	Oh, all right.	[]
Mr. Dawkins	5	0	Oh yeah, baby! Oh-hm.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	3	0	OHOH YEAH!! AHHH!!	[]
Butters	6	0	Quick, General Disarray! Kill those superheroes!	[]

Butters	12	0	Yes! Now the world shall feel the wrath of Professor Chaos! Hahaha!	[]
Linda	15	0	Butters?  Butters, you haven't seen Eric Cartman in the past few days, have you?	[]
Butters	2	0	Who, me?	[]
Linda	16	0	It's very importance, Butters. He's missing. You haven't seen or heard from him?	[]
Butters	3	0	No ma'am.	[]
Linda	1	0	Okay.	[]
Dougie	9	0	Come on, Professor Chaos! Let's destroy this anthill!	[]
Butters	10	0	Geh-General Disarray, can I ask you a scientific question?	[]
Dougie	1	0	Okay.	[]
Butters	19	0	Well, um, can... Can anything bad happen if you completely freeze yourself and then unfreeze yourself three weeks later?	[]
Dougie	1	0	...Yeah.	[]
Butters	3	0	Well, like what?	[]
Dougie	3	0	...Like, you die.	[]
Butters	1	0	...Die??	[]
Dougie	27	0	Well yeah. If you freeze your body, it means you die. When you wake up three weeks later you can be unfrozen, but you're still dead.	[]
Butters	2	1	Oh hamburgers!!	['hamburgers']
Butters	2	0	Eric! Erihic!	[]
Dougie	10	0	You just left him here?! Without a jacket or anything?!	[]
Butters	4	0	He told me to!	[]

Butters	4	0	Uh, eh, Eric! Eric!	[]
Dougie	9	0	Butters ButterButterBUTTERS!  We have to get out of here!	[]
Butters	1	0	What??	[]
Dougie	38	0	Nobody is ever going to find his body. You've got to never say anything about this, do you understand?! He's dead, and if they know you had a hand in it, you'll go to jail!	[]
Butters	8	0	But I just did what he told me!	[]
Dougie	6	0	Come on, we have to leave!!	[]
Butters	3	0	Oh jumping Jesus!	[]
Cartman	9	0	This is terrible. Five hundred years in the future.	[]
Shvek	15	0	Eric, I have good news for you. We may have found you a Nintendo Wii.	[]
Cartman	4	0	What??  Really??  YES!! YES!!	[]
Medic	16	0	It's rumored that there's one at the Museum of Technology at New New Hampshire.	[]
Cartman	11	0	So I'm not too late! Come on, let's go!	[]
Shvek	13	0	Well, there's just... th-there's something we need from you first.	[]
Shvek	11	0	You see, my young friend, you were unfrozen for a reason.	[]
Medic	18	0	Lots of people froze themselves in cryogenic labs and we don't unfreeze them. But you... are special.	[]
Cartman	11	0	I know I'm special. This isn't news to me.	[]
Shvek	25	0	You lived in a time when a great event happened. A glorious event that finally made all religion obsolete. Now, the entire world is atheist.	[]
Cartman	8	0	And this gives me a Nintendo Wii how?	[]
Medic	22	0	We believe that somebody you knew in your time was the person who first started our wonderful group: The Unified Atheist League.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Who?	[]
Shvek	7	0	What in Science's name was that?!	[]
Medic	8	0	Oh no! It's the United Atheist Alliance!	[]

Cartman	2	0	Jesus Christ!	[]
Shvek	10	0	Hahahaha, you believe in a supernatural being.  Oh my Science.	[]
Cartman	15	0	I'm just a little boy from the past who wants to play Nintendo Wii.	[]
