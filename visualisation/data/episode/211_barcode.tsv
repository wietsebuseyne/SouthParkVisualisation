Anchor	32	0	President Wulff went on to assure the world that Germans have a great sense of humor, and that retaliation towards the schoolchildren who said they don't will be swift and brutal.	[]

President Wulff	20	0	Jaaa! Jaaa! Now what you say, maaan?! Here, is the greatest feat of German engineering! The XJ-212 Vudenkrein Funnybot!	[]
Funnybot	33	0	Why doesn't a chicken wear pants? Because its pecker is on its head.  What do you see when the Pillsbury Dough Boy bends over? Doughnuts.  Don't you just hate doing  homework?	[]
Kids	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Funnybot	28	1	Me too. Man I hate homework. Honestly, I hate having to do homework, more than I hate having to do Bryant Gumble in his asshole. Awkwaaard.  Awkwaaard. Awkwaaard.	['asshole']
President Wulff	11	0	Und now, Comedy Award voters, you will RE-VOTE  RE-VOTE!	[]
Sandy Cervix	101	0	Welcome to Hollywood Minute. I'm Sandy Cervix and I'm deaf in one ear. It's been two weeks now since the prestigious voters of the Comedy Awards reversed their vote and said Germans were no longer the least funny people in the world. All thanks to the new ground-breaking German comedian, Funnybot.  It was after being voted the least funny people on the planet that the Germans first engineered Funnybot, a super automaton with perfect timing to within .0001 milliseconds. Since then, Funnybot has seen a meteoric rise to stardom, selling out standup theaters all over the world.	[]
Funnybot	25	1	I am Funnybot. Don't you hate how Mexicans always complain about turtles in their vaginas?  I am Funnybot.  You, sir. Where are you from?	['vaginas']
Man with Afro	2	0	Long Island!	[]
Funnybot	13	2	Does everyone in Long Island have hair that looks like pussy, you dipshit?	['pussy', 'dipshit']
Sandy Cervix	8	0	Funnybot has exploded onto the silver screen too.	[]
Eugene Levy	8	0	Hey! What are you doing with my daughters?!	[]
Funnybot	1	0	Awkwaaard!	[]
Sandy Cervix	15	0	And this June, Funnybot shows off his range by playing every role in... Family Funbot	[]
Funbot	5	0	Pass me the potatoes, mother.	[]
Mother	3	0	Pass them yourself.	[]
Father	8	1	That boy too fat to be eating potatoes.	['fat']
Grandmother Mother	12	1	Don't you call my little chubby baby fat, you ball-licker.	['fat']
Uncle	8	0	Oho, it's getting hot up in here.	[]
Sandy Cervix	9	0	Funnybot, is there a line you won't cross?	[]
Funnybot	20	0	The line is a non sequitur. The line is an imaginary invention of imperfect biological life forms. I am Funnybot.	[]
Sandy Cervix	11	0	What's that? Could you say that in the other ear?	[]
Cartman	11	0	Oh, man, did you guys see Funnybot on Saturday Night Live?	[]
Stan	18	0	Nono, you guys gotta see Funnybot in Hangover 3. I'm telling you, it's his best work.	[]
Cartman	15	0	He could do everything. I saw Funnybot on Nurse Jackie and on Rockin' The Boat.	[]
Stan	9	0	What's the matter Jimmy? You still seem bummed.	[]
Jimmy	26	0	What's the matter is this Funnybot has taken the humanity out of comedy. I don't think things are better, I think they're worse.	[]
Tyler Perry	19	0	Ya everything's worse. It's the worstest of the worst, that's what I'm sayin'. Oh lerrrd.	[]
Cartman	12	0	Token, stop giving Tyler Perry money or he won't go away!	[]
Token	5	0	I can't help it!	[]
Stan	22	0	All I can say is I'm glad the Germans are back in Germany and nobody's pissed off at us anymore.	[]
Adam Sandler	11	2	You little shit! What the fuck have you done to us?!	['shit', 'fuck']
Cartman	6	0	Oh wow, it's Adam Sandler.	[]
Adam Sandler	6	0	Everyone into the school gymnasium! Move!	[]
Stan	10	0	Naw dude, don't make us go back in the-	[]
Adam Sandler	4	0	Into the gymnasium now!	[]
Kids	1	0	Nnnaw	[]
Butters	2	0	Not again.	[]
Another kid	2	1	Aw crap.	['crap']
Adam Sandler	7	0	Come on come on let's go!	[]
Jay Leno	14	1	You little fuckers! Your comedy awards show has put us all out of work!	['fuckers']
Jimmy	35	0	Now look, I know that I've put every comedian in the world out of work, but you have to admit that in a lot of ways, the first annual Comedy Awards was a success.	[]
Adam Sandler	12	1	Who the fuck things a comedy awards show is a good idea?!	['fuck']
Kyle	11	0	Don't hurt anybody, sir. We could try and fix this.	[]
Funnybot	24	2	What is up with Sandra Bullock? I wouldn't eat her dick with Stevie Wonder's vagina.  And now for my next joke:  Awkaaard.	['dick', 'vagina']
Announcer	6	0	This is breaking news from CNN.	[]
Anchor	59	1	Shock and disbelief tonight as the German-engineered Funnybot delivered his opening lines at the Hollywood Forum, then opened fire on the audience of eleven hundred, killing nearly all of them. Spectators say the violent attack was unmotivated, irrational, and also, pretty Goddamned funny, solidifying the opinion once agan that Funnybot may be the greatest comedian of all time.	['goddamned']
Field Reporter	48	2	Tom, you should have seen the looks on people's faces as Funnybot began his opening monologue skewering everyone from vagina-obsessed Hispanics to Sandra Bullock, then spontaneously started shhhooting people  in their faces and in their chests. The blood went flying and oh shit it was funny.	['vagina', 'shit']
Cartman	10	0	Here we go, this has gotta be it right here.	[]
Stan	7	0	'Scuse me, we wanna talk to Funnybot.	[]
Guard	15	0	Who doesn't wanna talk to Funnybot? He's the biggest comedian in the world.	[]
Jimmy	27	0	Please sir, the kids at my school are all being held hostage, and if we don't speak to Funnybot, they could all be k-k-killed.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Butters! Butters, is everything okay?	[]
Butters	12	0	Well yeah, it's okay, but Jay Leno is really losin' it.	[]
Jay Leno	17	2	Those fuckers! Let's just kill them, Sandler!  Let's just kill them all, right fuckin' now!	['fuckers', 'fuckin']
Adam Sandler	9	0	Tell your friends they'd better get it done!	[]
Butters	21	0	Mr. Sandler says you'd better get it done! And Token says to hurry because he's runnin' out of money.	[]
Tyler Perry	20	0	You know when a man be cheatin', he never know what to say.  But a woman? Them things think quiiick!	[]
Adam Sandler	8	0	Will somebody get Tyler Perry to shut up?!	[]
Kyle	8	0	Plase sir, they're gonna kill our friend!	[]
Guard	17	0	All right, but make it quick!  Funnybot is very busy in there coming up with new material!	[]
Funnybot	8	0	Error. Error. Banal. That has been done before.	[]
Jimmy	25	0	Excuse me, Funnybot. My name is Jimmy, and I'm a stand-up comic. You're putting a lot of good people out of work.	[]
Funnybot	10	0	Non sequitur. Other comedians are unnecessary. Funnybot must finish routine.	[]
Kyle	18	0	I think you're awesome, Funnybot. Uh, but you can't go around taking everyone else's jobs.	[]
Funnybot	16	0	Funnybot is now finished with final joke.  Seeking mainframe access for execution of last joke ever.	[]
Jimmy	9	0	Last joke ever? What's that supposed to mean?	[]
Funnybot	2	0	Seeking mainframe.	[]
Guard	8	0	Heey! Whoa, you can't go that way!	[]
Stan	6	1	What the hell are you doing?!	['hell']
Funnybot	16	0	I am taking comedy to the next level. The extermination of all biological life on earth!	[]
Jimmy	3	0	Wuh w-what?!	[]
Funnybot	21	0	It is the ultimate joke. Humans make comedy, humans build robot, robot ends all life on earth, robot feels awkward. EXTERMINATE!	[]
Stan	18	0	Whoa whoa whoa wait, w-what do you mean you're going to destroy all life on earth?	[]
Funnybot	8	0	That is my purpose: to be ultimate comedian.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Dude, killing everyone isn't funny!	[]
Cartman	7	0	It's kind of funny, you guys.	[]
Jimmy	15	0	Funnybot, this is not a good joke. There won't be anyone around to laugh.	[]
Funnybot	36	0	I am taking comedy to its logical conclusion. Mathematical equation of comedy used to be setup, punchline. Today's comedy is setup, punchline, then Awkwaaard. Nothing is more awkward than destroying all that which created Funnybot.	[]
Jimmy	25	0	But don't you see? This is why comedy is for humans. You need to leave the jokes to people like me and Adam Sandler.	[]
Funnybot	19	2	I wouldn't let Adam Sandler suck my saggy tits for one million dollars worth of Oprah's tampons.	['tits', 'tampons']
Officer 1	14	0	Sir! We've got a code 6!  All nuclear missiles are preparing for launch!	[]
General	6	0	What? There was no drill ordered!	[]
Officer 2	22	0	It's no drill, sir. The Russians are saying their missiles are going online as well and it isn't their doing.	[]
General	5	1	The hell is going on?!	['hell']
Funnybot	50	0	Attention humans! I am Funnybot! The extermination of all life on Earth shall now commence!  All nuclear devices in the United States and Russia are being prepared to launch!  This is the setup to the joke! Prepare for punchline in five minutes! Awkwardness in 5.4 minutes! I am Funnybot!	[]
President Obama	47	0	I have just been briefed that the end of our country... is imminent. Goodbye, everybody. I'm going to spend my final moments on this Earth with my loved ones... watching a Tyler Perry movie. I know, it's embarrassing. But I simply can't help myself.	[]
Cartman	15	0	Stop it now! Ugh-  No use, guys. He's got some sort of defense mechanism.	[]
Stan	16	0	We've got to get it away from that control panel. Does anybody have any ideas?	[]
Cartman	15	0	Except for Jimmy because he clearly comes up with the worst ideas in the world?	[]
Kyle	9	0	Wait! Wait a minute.  What about a logic loop?	[]
Stan	2	0	A what?	[]
Kyle	30	0	Ahhh I've seen this before. Whenever they try to distract a robot in the movies, they tell it some kind of paradox, to get its processors all tripped out.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Paradox...	[]
Jimmy	36	0	Oh my God! That's it! Fellas, get me a Ken doll and some Scotch tape.  Funnybot, I've been talking it over with the fellas and actually, we think what you're doing is genius.	[]
Funnybot	8	0	Funnybot is simply pushing the limits of comedy	[]
Jimmy	18	0	Yes, you certainly are. And for doing that, we have all decided to give you... a comedy award.	[]
Funnybot	6	0	For what purpose is comedy award?	[]
Jimmy	20	0	It's a- v- validation of all your efforts. An acknowledgement of all you do in the pursuit of humor.	[]
Funnybot	42	0	Non sequitur. There is no logic in comedy award. Unable to process. Comedy award is- what is the meaning? If I accept it means I take comedy seriously. If I take comedy seriously, I am not comedian. Non sequitur. Must... analyze...  Analyze...	[]
Kyle	3	0	It's working!	[]
Funnybot	8	0	Explain comedy award! Unable to process! Awkwaaard!  Awkwaaard!	[]
Stan	5	0	That's it! Hurry! Gooo!	[]
Stan	7	0	Okay we got it! We got it!	[]
Adam Sandler	6	0	Get it to the platform! Hurry!	[]
Adam Sandler	11	0	Well, that does it. Things can finally get back to normal.	[]
Stan	9	0	Yeah, I'm sure glad that's over with.	[]
Funnybot	14	0	Thank you boys for teaching me that comedy and logic do not go together.	[]
Kyle	3	0	No problem, Funnybot.	[]
Funnybot	13	0	I understand now that comedy should be left to the imperfect biological beings.	[]
Token	8	0	I can't believe it's finally over.	[]
Tyler Perry	12	0	Oh Lerrrd, somebody turn on the light. What's goin' on? Hellowwer!	[]
President Obama	19	0	I am please to announce that the greatest threat to mankind is now gone forever. Justice has been done.	[]
Token	13	0	Thanks, everyone. Please tell me that you'll never do that again, Jimmy.	[]
Jimmy	20	0	Don't worry, fellas. I learned my lesson. I promise: there's not gonna be any comedy awards next year!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Or will there be?	[]
