Manson	8	0	Stan, I wanna talk to you about family.	[]
Stan	1	0	What?!	[]
Howard	1	0	What?!	[]
Manson	60	0	You see, I had a family once. At least, I called them my family. Really, they were nothin' but a gang of people I thought were my friends. Ah after we killed a bunch of people together, I realized that my real family was who took care of me, and who took the time to care about what I did.	[]
Stan	13	0	But they don't care about me, they just want to punish me.	[]

Manson	4	0	Good! I deserve to!	[]
Chief Stevens	1	0	What??	[]
Manson	29	0	I can never make it up to the families that I destroyed, but at least I'll make an example for anyone else thinking that crime  is an answer.	[]
Chief Stevens	2	0	Stop that.	[]
Manson	41	0	You see, I get it now! I finally understand what the holidays are all about. Boys, don't you see? You can't let things get you down during the holidays, because being happy is what the holidays are all about!	[]

Stan	6	0	Hooray! Uh, I mean, wait. What?	[]
Robert Pooner	32	0	And so, Manson is hauled off to jail to rot in his cell. Everything is back to normal, and I guess the only thing left to say is, God bless us, everyone.	[]
Manson	96	0	And I guess that's what I've learned. I'm sorry for what I did, but that doesn't make up for it. I deserve to be in jail. All I hope is that I don't make mankind lose faith in itself. Yes, there's murderers in the world. There's rapists and thieves. But those are the vast minority. The majority of mankind is made up of caring people, who try every day to do what they think is right. And that's the spirit of the season. What do you think, guys?	[]
Inmate	8	0	It sucks, just like all your other books.	[]
