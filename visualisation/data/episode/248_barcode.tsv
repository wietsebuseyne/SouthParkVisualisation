Kyle	17	0	Yeah, I just... well I just thought our company name would be more like uh... or-original	[]
Cartman	20	2	It's a strong name, dude. It's like agressive and masculine like Boner Forest, but Boner Forest was taken.	['boner', 'boner']
Kyle	17	0	Yeah, but maybe we need a name that's more affirming, like, shows what we stand for.	[]

News 4 Anchor	67	0	Another new startup company is gaining a lot of attention on the Internet. They're a company that does absolutely nothing, and they're called, the Washington Redskins.  The Redskins started as what appeared to be some kind of adolescent prank, but almost overnight it has become one of the most heavily funded projects on Kickstarter.  Why did you give five dollars to the Washington Redskins Kickstarter?	[]
Teen Boy	21	0	I dunno, I just. Uh. They don't do anything, that's pretty sweet. I dunno, I thought it was funny.	[]
Cartman	35	0	By pledging just one or two dollars, you are helping us in our fervent quest to not have to do stuff. If you pledge $10 or more, you will receive this luxurious company micro badge.	[]
News 4 Anchor	27	0	It's called crowd-funding, using the Internet to raise money without having to pay back your investors, a tactic that some believe is unfair and impersonal.	[]
Cartman	29	2	Washington Redskins. Go fuck yourself.  Sure, we'd be happy to take your money. Yup. Go to our kickstarter page. Okay, nice, idiot. Uh huh, fuck you, bye bye.	['fuck', 'fuck']
Businessman	4	0	You are Eric Cartman?	[]
Cartman	3	0	Yes, I know.	[]
Dan Snyder	15	0	My name is Dan Snyder. I'm the president and owner of the Washington Redskins	[]
Cartman	6	0	Oh, cool. Please take a seat.	[]
Dan Snyder	6	0	Thank you, but I will stand.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Nice, I like that.	[]
Dan Snyder	16	0	Young man, we ask that you please stop using the name Washington Redskins for your organization.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Stop? But why?	[]
Dan Snyder	23	0	Because we are the Washington Redskins, and we are a football team! You have NO right to use our name to get attention!	[]
Cartman	21	0	Uhhh, the trademark got pulled so I'm totaly free to use the name, actually.  Um, Butters, could you get that?	[]
Butters	5	1	Washington Redskins. Go fuck yourself.	['fuck']
Dan Snyder	18	0	Look! Don't you see that when you call your organization The Washington Redskins, its offensive to us?	[]
Cartman	4	0	How is it offensive?	[]
Coach	6	0	How is it offensive?! Jesus, what-?!	[]
Dan Snyder	20	0	We are a proud team, Mr. Cartman! We have no wish to be associated with people who actively do nothing!	[]
Coach	6	0	Makes us feel like a joke	[]
Cartman	27	0	Guys, guys! We have total respect for you! When we name our company Washington Redskins, it was out of deep appreciation for your team and your people.	[]
Dan Snyder	24	0	Uh, I know I can't legally make you stop using our name, but, but won't you just do it out of decency?	[]
Cartman	35	1	Mmmm, noooo, Because I don't want to. Aaaand we can't just change the name of our company 'cause it's like super hard. But hey, from one Redskin to another, go fuck yourself.	['fuck']
Flight attendant	33	0	All around the world, people are saying they are inspired by the Washington Redskins. The Internet startup company has raised so much money in Kickstarter that now, more groups are doing the same.	[]
Reporter	40	0	More news on the Washington Redskins tonight. Their defiant. F-You attitude has now caught the attention of the terrorist group ISIS. The terrorists said they admire the Washington Redskins and want to try it and follow their business model.	[]
A caller	27	0	Well, let's not forget, Marsha that there's a people here, okay, who are not happy about the use of the name, the Football Washington Redskins!	[]
Woman	9	0	Well yeah, but does anyone really care about them?	[]
Cartman	22	0	Dude, this is sooo cool! We only have six days to go before all the money pledged to our company becomes liquid!	[]
Kyle	35	0	Guys, we need to talk to you. I really don't think we wanna be a company that ISIS looks up to. We should maybe issue a statement saying that we don't sanction them.	[]
Cartman	25	0	Oh no. No, you guys. We started this company to do nothing. If we start doing stuff now, it'll put it all at risk!	[]
Kyle	21	0	People aren't gonna support our company if we dig in our heels and say we don't care about anything!	[]
Cartman	74	1	Digging in our heels and pissing on public opinion us what the Washington Redskins are all about!  Now come on, guys! If you wanna be a successful business, then you have to be honest about what you are!  Once you take a stand on something, you're pretending like your company is about more than money. Then all of a sudden you're the NFL and and your players get caught molesting little boys!	['molesting']
Kyle	5	0	That's the Catholic Church!	[]
Cartman	45	0	NFL, Catholic Church, same thing! Okay, let's use the Catholic Church! You take a moral stand on issues, you say you're about honor and integrity, and the next thing you know, your clergymen are getting caught beating up their wives in an elevator!	[]
Kyle	4	0	That's the NFL!	[]
Cartman	41	1	It's the same thing, Kyle! The point is, if we as an organization claim to be about high morality, somebody is eventually going to get raped or beaten in an elevator and it's most likely going to be Butters.	['raped']
Butters	2	0	Oh no!	[]
Kyle	24	0	All right, I really don't want to have to do this, but... I'm not happy with the direction this company is taking.	[]
Cartman	17	0	Well, what are you gonna do? Go back to school? I'm not going back there, man!	[]
Kyle	7	0	Maybe I'll start my own company.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Well that's fine! You can't call yourself Washington Redskins!	[]
Kyle	10	0	I don't want to! It's a stupid name!	[]
Cartman	12	0	Well, I guess everything's out on the table now, huh Kyle?	[]
Kyle	7	0	Yeah. I guess... I guess everything is.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Stan? Do you think our name is stupid too?	[]
Stan	18	0	I don't know, I... But I don't know if my future is with this company either.	[]
Cartman	13	0	Well then, I wish you both well in your new venture. Good-bye.	[]
Butters	22	1	Hang on, is this the company where I don't get raped? Yeah, he-here, right? Okay, I'm uh stayin' here.	['raped']
Dan Snyder	34	0	Is the league just going to sit by and while my team and my players are compared to ISIS. You have to do something, Commissioner Goodell! What are you going to do about this?!	[]
Goodell	13	0	I will get it right, and do whatever is necessary to accomplish that.	[]
Dan Snyder	1	0	What?!	[]
Goodell	11	0	We will continue to identify and add expertise to our team.	[]
Dan Snyder	17	0	That's the most ridiculous nothing answer I've ever heard! What are you gonna do now?!	[]
Goodell	11	0	Everyone will participate in educating sessions starting in the next month.	[]
Dan Snyder	5	0	Ugh! This thing is broken!	[]
Goodell	12	0	We can add... and we will do more, do more, do more	[]
Dan Snyder	12	0	Get all the NFL owners on Skype! This thing is broken again!	[]
Dan Snyder	19	0	And so I call upon the help of all owners. You cannot let my people be belittled like this!	[]
Jim Irsay	16	0	Dan, you don't wanna be dealin' with this stuff. Let the Goodell-bot do it.	[]
Dan Snyder	6	0	The stupid thing isn't working!	[]
Goodell	5	0	I will get it right.	[]
Steve Bischiotti	11	0	Man, that thing hasn't worked right since we bought it.	[]
Dan Snyder	21	0	Look, my team is starting to lose hope. You have to use your influence to make these people change their name.	[]
Paul Allen	10	0	Did you tell them we're about honor and integrity?	[]
Alex Spanos	16	0	If the Goodell bot is broken, we must stay out of it more than even usual!	[]
Dan Snyder	26	0	And so I'm alone? What if they ridicule the 49ers team next? Or make fun of Jerry Jones because his eyes are too far apart?	[]
Jerry Jones	7	0	My eyes aren't too far apart!	[]
Paul Allen	13	0	If we get them to change their logo, will it make you happy?	[]
Dan Snyder	8	0	Uh I guess we can live with that.	[]
Jim Irsay	24	0	Then it is decided! We will make them change their logo. Begin mas behind-the-scenes under-the-table enforcement of our wishes NOW	[]
Owners	1	0	Go!	[]
Dan Snyder	2	0	Thank God!	[]
Cartman	270	9	Fuck youuuu, fuck youuuu. Fuck you up there! Fuck you! Fuck you. Those words mean a great deal to us. They help us express just how we as a company... see things differently. There are a lot of startup companies on Kickstarter, but after today I think you'll agree that Washington Redskins is the most exciting. As you know, the Redskins have been on the forefront of Kickstarter as a company that is always finding new and exciting ways to tell people to go fuck themselves. And now, our company is thrilled to show you all the latest innovations we've come up with.  To begin with, we have moved the couch from the left side of the office to the right side. But we didn't stop there. We also added a new rug that goes better with our office drapes. And probably most exciting of all, we have actually updated the company from the inside out. We received a lot of pressure from certain communities to change our Redskins logo. As a company we want to be firm, but we also want to be flexible. And so we thought, if we have to change our logo, it should be more in step with today's times, but still define us as the leading Kickstarter company. What we came up with is the new company logo that I think you'll all agree is very exciting.  Now when people hear the name Redskins, they will immediately think titties and balls. It's just a bold new way that we can say We don't fucking care. Go Redskins!	['fuck', 'fuck', 'fuck', 'fuck', 'fuck', 'fuck', 'titties', 'balls', 'fucking']
Kyle	20	0	It's so awesome, dude. Our company already has a hundred backers. And we still have 14 days to go!	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah...	[]
Kyle	3	0	You okay, bro?	[]
Stan	17	1	I just... never saw myself owning a company called Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly on the Table, INC.	['balls']
Kyle	8	0	Give it time, it'll grow on you.	[]
Stan	10	0	Why don't we just call it Untitled Startup Company?	[]
Kyle	16	0	Because that sounds like we don't have anything, We've been through this already, Stan!	[]
Stan	16	0	Yeah, I know that. But a good company should never have seven words in its title.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Well whattaya mean?	[]
Stan	24	0	I just feel that somewhere out there, there's a perfect startup company name. And I need to be free to go find it.	[]
Kyle	22	1	Oh. Well, I certainly don't want you to feel that Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly on the Table is holding you back.	['balls']
Stan	6	0	Good luck with your company, dude.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Yeah. Good luck with yours.	[]
Employee	11	0	It's just... incredible, Harry. Everyone is using Kickstarter for everything!	[]
Harry	8	0	And for every project funded, we get 5%.	[]
Employee	16	0	It's like, we don't even have to do anything and we just make money.	[]
Harry	7	1	Sitting on our asses, here we come.	['asses']

Employee 2	1	0	Huh?	[]
Cartman	3	0	Goooood morning, guys!	[]
Butters	3	0	Happy Deadline Day!	[]
Cartman	27	0	We made it, guys. We cab finally stop doing stuff and see just how much our company made in 4, 3, 2, 1 that's the deadline!	[]
Butters	7	0	Oh boy, this is like Christmas morning!	[]
Cartman	32	1	What the hell? Can't find the server?  Kickstarter.com!  Kickstarter. Where is Kickstarter?! Get it up on the phone, Butters. Come on, I wanna know how much our company is worth!	['hell']
Butters	13	0	It's not coming up on my phone either. I... Holy Mother Mary!	[]
Kenny	1	0	(What?!)	[]
Butters	11	0	Somebody raided Kickstarter and they burned the building to the ground!	[]
Cartman	1	0	What?!	[]
Butters	3	0	Somebody killed Kickstarter!	[]
Cartman	18	2	Who the hell would burn Kickstarter to the ground?!  Oh my God! That weird little Jewy guy! Kyle!	['hell', 'jewy']

Cartman	5	1	You song of a bitch!	['bitch']
Kyle	1	0	What?!	[]
Cartman	3	0	You broke Kickstarter!	[]
Kyle	9	0	No, I just can't get it to load.	[]
Cartman	22	0	Nobody can! It's gone! You just couldn't take it that our company was more successful than yours would ever be!	[]
Kyle	13	0	My company was on Kickstarter too! Why would I get rid of it?!	[]
Cartman	3	0	Well, somebody did!	[]
Stan	73	0	It doesn't matter, you guys. There's something a lot more important here.  Do you guys remember when we first decided to start a company together? We all had a common goal. And we weren't gonna let anything stop us from getting to the bro down. But somewhere between starting up and selling out we... we lost our way. We can't do this on our own. We need each other.	[]
Kyle	8	0	He's right. We should do a merger.	[]
Cartman	24	0	A merger?! It's too late for that, you guys! Kickstarter is gone! We don't have a company! We don't have anything!	[]
Kyle	32	0	Yes we do! We have a sweet name.  I was wrong, Cartman. Washington Redskins is the perfect name. I think maybe I was jealous that I didn't come up with it.	[]
Cartman	4	0	It is really sweet.	[]
Stan	19	0	And we always said that all we needed was a sweet name and the rest would figure itself out,	[]
Butters	12	0	Yeah, we can do it, fellas! It'll be like old times!	[]
Kyle	3	0	Whattaya say, Cartman?	[]
Cartman	38	3	Fuck you! Fuck you, everyone. Yes, fuck you all, thanks!  How do you stay relevant in a volatile marketplace? As you know, our goal at Washington Redskins is to not do anything, and make money not doing it.	['fuck', 'fuck', 'fuck']
Kyle	63	0	When Kickstarter went down, many saw their startup projects die, but here at Washington Redskins, we saw opportunity. People still need a way to raise money for their stupid startup projects, and with the Redskins you can now go fund yourself.  And the idea is simple. You, the people, go out and raise all your own money, and give the Washington Redskins 5%.	[]
Cartman	43	1	You will literally be giving us money for doing absolutely nothing. It is the biggest fuck you we have ever come up with. But we didn't stop there, because a new company direction also means, of course, a new and improved logo.	['fuck']
Cartman and Kyle	2	0	Go Redskins!	[]
Announcer	35	0	A beautiful night in Arlington, Texas as the Dallas Cowboys get set to take on the Washington Redskins. That is, of course, Washington Redskins the football team, not Washington Redskins, the audacious crowd-funding company.	[]
Commentator	11	0	Yeah, and if you ask me, the Redskins are a scam.	[]
Announcer	10	0	You're talking about the crowd-funding company- Redskins, right?	[]
Commentator	30	0	That's right. An-and now you've got terrorist groups like ISIS using the Redskins to raise their money. I-I don't like what the Redskins are doing.	[]
Announcer	2	0	Those Redskins	[]
Commentator	2	0	Yeah, whatever.	[]
Dan Snyder	27	0	No. No, we cannot give up! We have been through too much together. We have fought Eagle, and Bear! The Eagles only beat us by three points.	[]
Dan Snyder	11	0	Don't let them break you! Don't let them win!	[]
Announcer	21	0	And the Cowboys are still set to kick off, but there doesn't seem to be anyone to kick off to.	[]
Commentator	16	0	Yeah, and Jerry Jones must be happy this means a forfeit, another win for the Cowboys.	[]
Announcer	22	0	Wait a minute, it appears a lone Redskin is making his way out of the locker room.  The Cowboys kick it off.	[]
