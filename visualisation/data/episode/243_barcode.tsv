Cartman	44	0	Hey, everyone? Excuse me!  Everybody, can I just have a second of your time, please? Everyone, listen up.  Listen everybody, I uh... I owe Kyle a big apology and I... I wanna do it in fromt of everyone because... ugh... I was wrong, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	2	0	About what?!	[]
Cartman	131	2	I'm afraid that... Kyle and I got into a little disagreement yesterday. Yeah, yeah it's... pretty nasty. And um, I was totally wrong and you were right, Kyle. I thought only humans could be gingers. Is Davin here? Davin Miller?  Oh yeah, there you are. I own an apology to you too, Davin. When Kyle said that humans weren't the only species that can have light skin and freckles I totally laughed in his face. But it turns out Kyle was right: there are other animals that can be ginger as well I didn't believe it. I guess I didn't want to believe it, but this morning I saw a red-haired light-skinned cow and I owe you, Kyle, and you, Davin, my sincerest apology.	['gingers', 'ginger']
Craig	8	0	Where did you find a red-haired cow?	[]

Kyle	5	0	Alright, Cartman, joke's over.	[]
Cartman	6	0	What? What joke? This is real!	[]
Kyle	9	0	Tell everyone you made the cow look like that!	[]
Cartman	9	0	No,  no, you were right, Kyle. I was wrong.	[]
Butters	15	0	Boy Eric, I sure do admire your courage to admit when you made a mistake.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Thank you, Butters!	[]

Kyle	5	0	I don't speak Hebrew.	[]
Mr. Mackey	26	3	Kyle, please try your best. It seems pretty important.  This.. boy... uhkay... is Jew. Uhkay? Jew... like you. Uhkay? Please... uh, please try... speak... to Jew.	['jew', 'jew', 'jew']
Rabbi 1	14	0	We're just trying to tell them that we come on very urgent business.	[]
Mr. Mackey	1	0	Anything?	[]
Kyle	7	0	He said they come on urgent business.	[]
Principal Victoria	5	0	Ohh, what does he need?	[]
Rabbi 2	24	0	Look, we believe that this school has something which is of the utmost importance to our people! We wish to see the red cow!	[]
Kyle	13	0	The red- Oh come on, you can't possibly be here for that!	[]
Principal Victoria	7	0	For what? What did he say, Kyle?	[]
Rabbi 1	61	0	Please, you must understand! The fate of the world is at stake!  The coming of a red heifer is the nost holy sign in all of Judaism. It signals the beginning of the End. It is not just our religion, but Islam and Christianity as well. They all agree on one thing.  That the red heifer means the End of Times.	[]
Mr. Mackey	6	0	You catch any of that, Kyle?	[]
Kyle	7	0	It's right over here by uh-	[]
Rabbi 2	4	0	Oh my holy shmear!	[]
Rabbi 2	6	0	The Muslims! They beat us here!	[]
Mr. Mackey	5	0	What's goin' on, Kyle??	[]
Kyle	10	1	He said the Muslims beat them here-  God damn it!	['damn']
Rabbi 2	8	0	Step away! You all know what this means!	[]
Cleric 1	9	0	Yes! And you know you are about to die!	[]
Kyle	9	0	Hold on everybody. This thing isn't even a-	[]
Rabbi 1	4	0	Don't touch it!	[]
Cartman	22	0	Well I just ran to the school and told everyone, Hey, there's a redheaded cow outside; you should all see it.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Cartman, stop! You don't know what you're doing!	[]
Cartman	24	1	I'm pretty sure that this cow could make ginger cheese, which is like a Swiss cheese, except instead of holes, it has freckles.	['ginger']
Kyle	1	0	NOOOO!	[]
Rabbi 4	16	0	The Muslims and the Christians are calling for a meeting to discuss the terms of war.	[]
Rabbi 2	15	0	Very well, let us meet to discuss how the world as we know it ends.	[]
Rabbi 1	17	0	Alright, so far we agree there'll be no automatic rifles, no shanks, and no chemical weapons.	[]
Cleric 2	15	0	If there can be no chemical weapons, then the Christians can use no nuclear weapons.	[]
Bishop	14	0	Come on, without nuclear weapons, what kind of final Armageddon is this gonna be?!	[]
Rabbi 3	11	0	But couldn't we agree on non-ballistic nuclear weapons only?	[]
Bishop	6	0	Yeah, I suppose that's fine.	[]
Cleric 2	3	0	That makes sense.	[]
Rabbi 1	15	0	Non-ballistic nuclear only. Alright. Now on to prisoners. Are we all agreeing to decapitations?	[]
Israeli	10	0	Of course we are! What do you think this is?!	[]
Others	7	0	Yeah, come on! Just get to it!	[]
Cleric 3	42	0	Wait a minute, wait a minute! Has anyone noticed something? We are all in a room together. Talking.  Has it occurred to anyone else that this prophecy, which amazingly is in all three religions, could actually be meant to bring us together?	[]
Bishop	16	0	The prophecy says the red heifer signals the End.  Could it mean the end of... war?	[]
Rabbi 1	18	0	If the cow is sacrificed in Israel according to the prophecy, then perhaps it could bring about peace.	[]
Anderson Cooper	79	1	After all the years of holy wars and hatred, a possibility for peace... in the Middle East. In the past 48 hours, Jews, Muslims, and Christians have met in Israel to sort out their differences. It may be a rocky road, but many say the chance for peace is real. And all because of a red cow, discovered by a young boy here in the U.S. We'll be back with more on these amazing developments after this.	['jews']
Cartman	7	0	Hey Kyle. Y-you got a minute?	[]
Kyle	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Cartman	18	0	I've gotta tell you something, Kyle. The red-headed cow... isn't real. I made him up.	[]
Kyle	2	1	No shit!	['shit']
Cartman	32	0	I totally lied, Kyle. And when you asked me if I had lied, I looked you right in the eye and said No. I owe you an apology and, I mean it.	[]
Kyle	19	0	Well it-... it's okay. there's no denying it all worked out for the best this time a-.	[]
Cartman	22	0	No! No, Kyle, you said that it's never for the best. Remember that? And you're right. You're right, Kyle!	[]
Kyle	17	0	Oh no. Nohoho no. Cartman, don;t you do this! The Middle East is finally at peace!	[]
Cartman	81	2	But it's not true. Kyle, I'm being serious. I really think I have to tell the truth! I I don't know how I can live with this. I don't think I can unless eh, unless I don't know mm-maybe you c-called your mom a fat skank?  Maybe if you'd said that to your mom and... told her that her tits belonged in a morgue, then, maybe somehow I could live with this lie.	['fat', 'tits']
Kyle	4	1	Dude, go to Hell!	['hell']
Cartman	18	0	You're right. You're right, Kyle. I should just tell the truth and be done with it!	[]

Kyle	7	0	I just... thought it'd be nice.	[]
Cartman	39	0	Kyle is doing all kinds of things for me. He finished my homework,  gave me the soda from his lunch.  I think he's just really stoked on me for helping bring peace to the Middle East.  Right, Kyle?	[]
Kyle	2	0	Yes sir.	[]

Rabbi 1	6	0	Oh no, it was a miracle?	[]
Israeli 2	10	0	Then, it's not true. The prophecy is not true!	[]
David Lee Roth	16	0	Wait, I thought we were all here because of the prophecy of a miraculous red cow!	[]
Rabbi 5	31	3	No, the prophecy is that one day, a fat child with a small penis would decorate a cow to look ginger, not that one would miraculously just fall from the sky.	['fat', 'penis', 'ginger']

Rabbi 3	5	0	No it di'n't.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Yes! It did!	[]
Rabbi 1	36	3	The prophecy was that a fat boy with a small penis would one day decorate a cow to look ginger. We should have known a prophecy like this... was too impossible to ever come to be.	['fat', 'penis', 'ginger']
Kyle	10	0	But that is what happened! It is! Tell them, Cartman!	[]
