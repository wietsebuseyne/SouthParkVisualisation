Woman 2	8	1	You done spilled that on my titties, skank!	['titties']
Woman 3	1	0	Oww...	[]
Announcer	29	0	They're white trash. And when you give them a little Pabst Blue Ribbon , they can't help getting arrested.  Tonight, on an all-new... White Trash... In Trouble!	[]
Narrator	34	0	Pabst Blue Ribbon and white trash. It's a deadly combination that can lead to prison time and children being taken away from their home.  This white trash home in Colorado seems innocent enough.	[]
Kenny	4	1	(Hmmm. What the fuck?)	['fuck']
Narrator	38	0	But the children in this home live in a world of neglect. There's no heating, no groceries,  and if you look closely in the backyard, you can even make out what appears to be a meth lab.	[]
Kenny	11	0	(Mom, the cops are here! Mom, Dad, the cops are here!)	[]
Cops	14	0	Down on the ground! Move it! Let's go! Move move! Get down, now!	[]

Officer 1	24	0	You have the right to remain silent. Now please look at the camera and say I'm white trash and I'm in trouble.	[]
Stuart	9	0	I'm white trash and I'm in trouble.	[]
Officer 1	7	0	Alright, good. Now get in the car!	[]
Cartman	27	0	Oh wow, poor people being arrested. What a rare occurrence.  Hi, Kenny! Kenny, wave!  That's Kenny, about to be sent to a foster home. Pretty funny.	[]
Officer 2	7	0	Just have a seat in there, kids.	[]
Kevin	7	0	Just have a seat in there, kids.	[]
Officer 1	37	0	The mother and father will probably be released from jail on Monday, but I guess the kids are gonna be taken away for good. Child Protective Services is about to talk to them in the soft room.	[]
Officer 3	3	0	The soft room?	[]
Officer 1	14	0	You know, the room we have set aside for kids to feel safe in.	[]
Mr. Adams	24	0	Hi kids, how you doin'? My name's Mr. Adams and I just need to get some info from you. Does that sound okay?	[]
Karen	5	0	Can I see my mommy?	[]
Mr. Adams	240	0	No, sorry. Now,  I've been looking over your file and I see you kids have all been horribly physically and emotionally abused.  Oh whoops, that isn't your case file, it's the Penn State University Gazette.  I'm joking, that's just a joke, we like to have fun here.  It is your case file. I was just all like it's the Penn State Gazette to be like a joke, we have fun. Now listen, you're gonna be put into a foster home, so I need to know... would you like to go to Neverland Ranch, a Catholic church, or Penn State University?  We're havin' fun here, aren't we? I just, I come up with these and the guys, it's good to laugh.  I just asked them if they wanted to go to Neverland, a Catholic church, or Penn State.  I'm a trickster. People say I'm really meant for comedy. Here's my head shot just in case you know anybody.  Can't hurt, right? Okay, now, are we all startin' to feel a little bit better?  Oh come on now, how about that smile? I'm gonna GET  you to smile! I'm gonna GET  you to smile!  A Penn State administrator walks into a bar. Where's that smile? How about this one? Joe Paterno doesn't walk into a police station. Come on, that's a good one.	[]
Stan	8	0	Did you hear anything more about what happened?	[]
Kyle	20	0	Dude, I don't think Kenny's coming back. My dad said those Child Protective Services people are pretty serious.	[]
Stan	17	0	We can't let Kenny be sent away forever. There's gotta be something we can do.	[]
Cartman	15	0	Guys! Guys! I've been workin' on it, and I think I have some answers.	[]
Stan	1	0	Really?	[]
Cartman	25	0	Yeah. I've gone through every student in the school, and I'm pretty sure now that Kenny's gone, the poor kid is Craig!	[]
Kyle	14	0	That's what you care about?! Who's the poorest kid in school now?!	[]
Cartman	35	0	Pretty much went through everybody. Craig's got the mo-  sh, sh sh sh sh. Here he comes, here he comes.  Heya, Craig, your uh... your family get you that jacket at Walmart or Kmart?	[]
Craig	5	0	What are you talking about?	[]
Cartman	32	0	Nothing dude, it's cool, it's cool. I mean, we would tell your parents to shop at nicer places, but... your mom is so poor she can't even pay attention.	[]
Officer 2	13	0	Mr. and Mrs. Weatherhead, we have the new foster kids for your care.	[]
Mr. Weatherhead	61	0	Very good, we'll take them from here. Children, enter.  Welcome to your new home. Before we show you around let's get one thing clear: this is a very strict religious household! As long as you live here you will be agnostic!  These are your foster brothers and sisters! They are all strict agnostics! David, do you believe in God?!	[]
David	4	0	I don't know...	[]
Mr. Weatherhead	85	0	Right! There are two bedrooms upstairs! Boys' room and girls' room! Your chores are listed on their respective doors! Follow!  You will eat only at designated meal times! Beverages you may take from the refrigerator as you like! However, in this house you will drink only agnostic beverages!  Dr Pep-er, and Diet Dr Pep-er!  Because what flavor is it?! It is neither root beer nor cola! Nobody is sure what flavor it is, and nobody can be sure! Isn't that right, Melissa?!	[]
Melissa	4	0	I don't know.	[]
Mr. Weatherhead	1	0	Good!	[]
Cartman	10	0	This is awesome, Butters! You really think you got something?!	[]
Butters	30	0	Yep. To find out who the poorest kid in school is, I actually was able to see which kids in school got those coupons they hand out for school lunch.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Eh yeah?	[]
Butters	37	0	So then I crossed that with all the kids who were on half-priced lunches with the tax records of people in town to see which kids' parents actually made the least amount of money last year.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Heh heh, yeah?	[]
Butters	6	0	Well actually, Eric, it's you.	[]
Cartman	1	0	What?	[]
Butters	16	0	Now that Kenny's gone,  your household actually has the lowest income.  I'm sorry, pal.	[]
Cartman	19	0	Oh my God... If we found this out it's only a matter of time before everybody else does.	[]
Butters	6	0	Uh, I won't tell anybody.	[]
Cartman	57	1	Oh come on! We're not the only ones who wanted to look into this! You think, you think Kyle isn't on the computer right now tryin' to see who the poorest kid in school is?! Oh he is gonna have such a field day, that heartless Jew!  Well I won't give him the satisfaction!	['jew']
Cartman	80	0	Alright, let's hear it for Kyle!  He's so funny, isn't he guys?! With all his jokes about Cartman being poor. You guys hear how poor Cartman's mom is?! His mom is so poor the ducks throw bread at her! Hahaha! That's super funny, guys!  Laugh it up, everyone!  Cartman's mom is so poor that when she goes to KFC, she has to lick other people's fingers! HA! I beat you to it, Kyel!	[]
Kyle	5	0	My name. Is not. Kyel.	[]
Cartman	12	0	That's kewl! Whatever Kyel! Must be nice having everything you want!	[]
Liane	2	0	Hi, sweetie.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Sit down Mom, we need to have a talk.	[]
Liane	6	0	Oh, what is it this time?	[]
Cartman	13	0	Mom, how are you going to start bringing more money into this household?	[]
Liane	2	0	What, hon?	[]
Cartman	14	0	You have to start doing more, Mom! What are you doing with your time?!	[]
Liane	12	0	Eric, I'm working two jobs. Mommy's doing everything she can.	[]
Cartman	19	0	Yeah, see, the problem is, Mom, is that with Kenny gone I'm now the poorest kids in skewl!	[]
Liane	21	0	Well, we're in a tough economy, Eric. I don't know what else you want me to do about it.	[]
Cartman	40	1	We're in a tough economy. You don't know what else I want you to do about it. Life isn't handed to you, Mom! You just can't sit on your ass and expect some money to appear!	['ass']
Liane	10	0	Eric, we aren't that much poorer than most people.	[]
Cartman	24	0	Not much huh?! My mom is so poor, when she heard about the Last Supper she thought she was running out of food stamps!	[]
Liane	1	0	Oh.	[]
Cartman	5	0	IT'S NOT FUNNY, MOM!!	[]
Cartman	30	0	My mom is so poor she waves around a Popsicle and calls it air conditioning. I wish I could be put in a kewl foster home like Kenny's familyyy.	[]
Karen	19	0	Huh?  Oh, it's you.  I was wondering when you'd appear. You always come when I'm sad.	[]
Mysterion	13	0	You are going to be okay, Karen! You have to keep believing that!	[]
Karen	9	0	Why did my mommy and daddy go to jail?	[]
Mysterion	20	0	Sometimes, people do stupid things. Sometimes they don't realize what should have come first. Until it's too late.	[]
Karen	6	0	But I'm all alone now.	[]
Mysterion	22	0	You are not alone. No matter where you go, no matter what you do, I will always be here! Do you understand?	[]
Karen	5	0	I'll try, guardian angel.	[]
Mysterion	5	0	Don't try, Karen. Do.	[]
Mr. Weatherhead	11	0	What in the name of nobody knows are you doing, Karen?!	[]
Officer 4	28	0	Police man.  Yes. Yes. Alright, thanks for the tip. We'll check it out.  Better call the lieutenant. Looks like we've got another meth lab in town.	[]
Officer 5	8	1	Got any needles on you? Any crack pipes?	['crack']
Liane	14	1	Oh, oh, my goodness no. I haven't used drugs in quite a while.	['drugs']
Officer 5	10	0	Then why is there a meth lab in your backyard?	[]
Cartman	89	0	What is going on here? Mom, what have you done? Were things so bad for you financially you had to turn to a life of crime?! My mom is so poor she uses Cheerios for earrings. Well... guess I'm off to a foster home then.  Hawaii is my first choice. Something not exactly on the beach but maybe just a short walk away?  Gonna take me years to recover from being torn from my mother's arms. Only the ocean breezes and coconut trees can help me now.	[]
Officer 5	28	0	When will you people learn to lay off the Pabst Blue Ribbon? Now look at the camera and say I'm white trash and I'm in trouble.	[]
Liane	11	0	Oh. Ah, I'm white trash and I'm in trouble.	[]
Mr. Adams	35	0	Hi there, how you doin'? My name's Mr. Adams, and I'm with Child Protective Services.  Here's my head shot.  I just need to get some information from you if that's okay.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Yeah, yeah.	[]
Mr. Adams	12	0	Okay, now it says here your mother was operating a meth lab.	[]
Cartman	3	0	That's right.	[]
Mr. Adams	51	0	And it also says here that Penn State prefers to be losing at halftime? Because at Penn State they like when you're a little behind in the locker room. That's a joke. Did you get that one? It's a play on words, we like to have fun here.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Wha'? Dude, do you think this is funny?!	[]
Mr. Adams	10	0	We just - no, we just like to have fun here.	[]
Cartman	35	0	Well I'll tell you somethin'! Being from a low-income household isn't funny! Oh heell no, my momma's so poor she opened a Gmail account just so she could eat the spam!	[]
Mr. Adams	16	0	What? What, is that supposed to be some kind of joke? You think you're funny?	[]
Cartman	9	0	A joke?! You think being poor is a joke?!	[]
Mr. Adams	3	0	Could be worse.	[]
Cartman	1	0	How?!	[]
Mr. Adams	23	0	Could be in Happy Valley! On a scale from 1 to 10, how old should you be to stay away from Penn State?	[]
Cartman	28	0	Dude, my momma's so poor when she gets mad she can't afford to fly off the handle so she's gotta go Greyhound off the handle!	[]
Mr. Adams	8	1	Two Penn State administrators walk into a butt-!	['butt']
Cartman	11	0	Jesus, this is a long drive. Are we in Hawaii yet?	[]
Officer 6	1	0	Hawaii?	[]
Cartman	9	0	Yeah, that's where I requested to be sent.	[]
Officer 7	12	0	Your foster home is here, pretty much the exact opposite of Hawaii.	[]
Cartman	2	0	What??  Greeley?	[]
Mr. Weatherhead	40	0	Come on now! This is not the way we told you to tidy up! Remember? Cleanliness is next to godliness, so make it kind of clean but not too much! Amanda! More ambiguous on the dusting!  Kenneth, answer the door!	[]
Cartman	11	0	What the? Dude, this is like poorer than my old house!	[]
Kenny	7	1	(What the fuck are you doing here?!)	['fuck']
Mrs. Weatherhead	12	0	Hello Eric, your room is upstairs to the left. Are you hungry?	[]
Cartman	5	0	You're my new mom?	[]
Mrs. Weatherhead	8	0	You can call me Mom if you like.	[]
Cartman	14	0	Alright Mom, how much money do you make? Like gross yearly income after taxes?	[]
Mr. Weatherhead	69	0	This is where you'll sleep with your foster brothers. You will be clean, polite, and most importantly, you WILL follow the agnostic code: We cannot know for certain if God or Christ existed. They COULD. Then again there COULD be a giant reptilian bird in charge of everything. Can we be CERTAIN there isn't? NO, so it's pointless to talk about. Now say it with me.	[]
Cartman	16	1	Goddamn, I've gotta sleep in a room with six other people?! How poor are we?!	['goddamn']
Mr. Weatherhead	30	0	HEY! We do not take the Lord's name in vain in this house, just in case there is one! Do you understand, or do you need the punishment room?!	[]
Cartman	12	0	Oh heell now!  Mom! Dad's being mean to me! Mem! MEEM!	[]
Mr. Weatherhead	5	0	My name. Is not. Meom!	[]
Cartman	13	0	Oh God, I'm so nervous. These kids all seem kind of mean.	[]
Karen	7	0	I'll see you at recess, right?	[]
Kenny	5	0	(I'll be there, Karen.)	[]
Cartman	32	0	You've already been here awhile, Kenny, so you have to introduce me to your friends, okay? And make sure they know I'm kewl. You've gotta have my back, Kenny!	[]
Boy 1	6	0	Oh hey, Kenny. Who's this?	[]
Kenny	4	0	(This is Eric Cartman.)	[]
Boy 2	9	0	Does he live with you at the foster home?	[]
Cartman	32	0	Okay, alright, so listen: I know our family is poor, okay?! But before we lived there, Kenny was actually poorer than me! So technically, he's the poorest kid at this school!	[]
Boy 1	14	0	What are you talking about? The poor kid at this school is Jacob Hallery.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Really?	[]
Boy 2	23	0	Yeah, dude. His dad died five years ago and his mom went crazy from depression, so she can't even keep a job.	[]
Cartman	97	0	YES! Yeheah, did you hear that Kenny?? We're good! I seriously thought we didn't stand a chance, but now... everything's gonna be okay! Cause I'm not (I'm not) the poor kid at school!   Let's hear it for Jacob Hallery, guys!  His mom is so poor she cuts coupons out to be institutionalized! Greeley Colorado's the place to be! It's a whole new beginning for you and me! Life can only get better 'cause I know one simple ruuule! I'm not (he's not) the poor kid at school!	[]
Boy 1	10	0	Did he do stuff like this at your old school?	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Uh huh.)	[]
Cartman	20	0	Let's put our hands up, everyone! 'Cept for Jacob. His mom's so poor she only understands hand-OUTS.	[]
Principal	14	0	Eric, at Greeley Elementary we do not tolerate students making fun of other students.	[]
Cartman	7	0	I wasn't making fun of anybody.	[]
Principal	26	0	A twenty-minute song and dance number with forty seven Yo momma so poor jokes directed at Jacob Hallery, which ended in a finale with fireworks.	[]
Cartman	4	0	I was just teasing.	[]
Principal	11	0	Your case worker has been notified, and he is not happy.	[]
Cartman	7	0	My case worker?  Oh, not this guy!	[]
Mr. Adams	77	0	I know this is a difficult adjustment for you, Eric! But you can't just turn all your frustrations on a little kid who can't defend himself! I mean, what do you think this is?! The shower room at Penn State?! I'm kidding. We like to have fun in our department, so I was like, Oh, look. What? Is this like the shower room at Penn State?! I joke around. This is my head shot.	[]
Cartman	20	0	Will you stop with the Penn State jokes?! All you're doing is taking topical and revamping old Catholic jokes!	[]
Mr. Adams	15	0	Oh! Oh, and your momma jokes are better?! They've been around since the '50s!	[]
Principal	10	1	What the hell does this have to do with anything?!	['hell']
Girl 1	18	0	Principal, you've gotta send help to the playground! They're about to beat up that new kid!	[]
Jessica	18	0	Aww, look at the new kid and her wittle dolly. You gonna cry some more in class, wimp?!	[]
Boy 3	4	0	L-leave her alone.	[]
Jessica	20	1	Shut up! You foster twerps are all the same! Come on! Hand over the doll!  Who the hell is this?!	['hell']
Mysterion	10	0	How about you find another little girl to pick on?	[]
Jessica	5	0	Mind your business, Peter Pan!	[]
Mysterion	15	0	Karen McCormick is off limits! Do you understand?! Make sure everybody in this school knows!	[]
Mr. Weatherhead	38	0	And if this food comes as a gift from some divine intelligence, we understand that an intelligent being cannot blame us for questioning its existence. Nobody knows, nobody can know if any deity is watching over us. Amen.	[]
Boy 4	6	0	Except for Karen's guardian angel.	[]
Mr. Weatherhead	1	0	What?	[]
Melissa	10	0	Where did he take you after he saved you, Karen?	[]
Karen	13	0	He just took me back to my classroom. Then he disappeared like always.	[]
Mr. Weatherhead	10	0	What have he told you about making up angel stories?!	[]
Girl 3	10	0	But we SAW him. He leaped down from the sky.	[]
David	9	1	And he kicked the crap out of Jessica Pinkerton.	['crap']
Mrs. Weatherhead	12	0	Stop it, children! We do not speak such certainties in this house!	[]
Mr. Weatherhead	15	1	Get down to the basement, all of you! It's time for the Punishment Room!	['basement']
David	1	0	AAAAAAAH!	[]
Mr. Weatherhead	6	0	Now, did you see an angel?!	[]
David	9	0	No, I - no - I didn't see an angel.	[]
Mr. Weatherhead	27	0	No, you can't be certain of that! You might've seen one!  Hit him with the Dr Pep-er again.  Are there such things as angels?!	[]
David	1	0	Maybe.	[]
Mr. Weatherhead	1	0	Good!	[]
Karen	6	0	What do we do, Kenny?  Kenny?	[]
Mr. Weatherhead	6	0	What is the meaning of life?!	[]
David	5	0	It's impossible to knoooow!	[]
Mr. Weatherhead	3	0	That's right!	[]
Mrs. Weatherhead	4	0	Who could that be?	[]
Mr. Adams	22	0	Mr. and Mrs. Weatherhead, I received some disturbing news that all you're providing the foster children here to drink is soda?	[]
Cartman	8	0	Haha, I told on you Mom and Dad!	[]
Mr. Weatherhead	6	0	What business is that of yours?!	[]
Mr. Adams	20	0	It's my business because Child Protective Services is accountable for these kids!  Have I given you my head shot?	[]
Mrs. Weatherhead	5	0	Yes, yes, we have that.	[]
Mr. Adams	12	0	Okay now, are you only giving these kids Dr Pepper to drink?	[]
Mr. Weatherhead	32	0	If we want to serve agnostic beverages in this house, then by Goddish we'll do it! The children you've sent here are undisciplined and talking about the certainty of angels!	[]
Mr. Adams	8	0	Excuse me!  Let's have a look around.	[]
Mr. Weatherhead	5	0	What the? Who did this?	[]
Mrs. Weatherhead	3	0	What is that?	[]
Mrs. Weatherhead	9	0	It was like a... little mystery person... flying around.	[]
Mr. Weatherhead	7	0	Almost like some kind of... agnostic angel.	[]
Mr. Adams	8	0	Oh my God.  What's going on here?	[]
David	9	0	We don't know... We can't possibly know...	[]
Mr. Adams	40	0	What have I done?  I took you kids from your parents without even checking into where you were going! I put innocent children in a dangerous environment! What am I, a recruitment coach for Penn State?  It's not funny!	[]
Mr. Weatherhead	14	0	There's nothing in there but Dr Pep-er, right? There can't be.	[]
Mrs. Weatherhead	1	0	Ohhh...	[]
Mr. Weatherhead	13	0	How did that get here?!  It says it's a Pabst Blue Ribbon.	[]
Mrs. Weatherhead	3	0	What is it?	[]
Mr. Weatherhead	6	0	It's like beer... but different.	[]
Mrs. Weatherhead	6	0	But how did it get here?	[]
Mr. Weatherhead	4	1	Shut your mouth, bitch!	['bitch']
Mrs. Weatherhead	8	2	You shut your mouth, you filth-fucking asshole!	['fucking', 'asshole']
Mr. Weatherhead	3	2	Fuck you, bitch!	['fuck', 'bitch']
Greeley Officer 1	23	0	You have the right to remain silent. Now look at the camera and say I'm white trash and I'm in trouble.	[]
Mrs. Weatherhead	9	0	I'm white trash and I'm in trouble!	[]
Greeley Officer 2	5	0	Get in the car, you!	[]
Mr. Weatherhead	12	0	Wait a minute, I'm white trash and I'm in trouble?	[]
Mr. Adams	34	0	No, no, take all these kids back to their parents! We've embarrassed the system and made it something nobody wants to be a part of! It's like a Penn State homecoming party!	[]
Greeley Officer 3	14	0	A false police report can carry up to a two-month prison term, son.	[]
Cartman	5	0	I'm not saying it.	[]
Greeley Officer 3	13	0	We can do this the easy way, or we can do it hard!	[]
Cartman	5	0	I'm not saying it!	[]
Greeley Officer 3	8	0	Then we'll add another charge for resisting!	[]
Cartman	11	0	Okay, fine!  I'm white trash and I'm in trouble!	[]
Narrator	30	0	Three arrests in just one power-packed episode, proving once again that we are all just one Pabst Blue Ribbon away from becoming... white trash in trouble! Sponsored by Schlitz.	[]
Stan	10	0	Well it sure is good to have you back, Kenny.	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Thanks, Stan.)	[]
Kyle	11	0	I hear your parents might give up selling meth for good.	[]
Kenny	3	0	(Good for me.)	[]
Cartman	7	0	There he is, there's my buddy.	[]
Kyle	4	0	How was jail, fatass?!	[]
Cartman	122	0	Well, I did a lot of thinking. And you know, guys, there's an important lesson I think we've all learned. What do we do when the tables are turned? The day's looking brighter. Gray skies are turning blue. 'Cause I'm not (He's not, he's not) the poor kid at school! Kenny's back and it's such a thrill. Now I'm rich just like Stan and Kiul! All that matters is no one thinks I'm a tool! 'Cause I'm not (He's not, he's not) That's right, the poor kid in school. Sing it with me, guys! He's not the poor kid in school. (He's not) I'm not-	[]
Kids	1	0	Aaaah!	[]
Kenny	1	0	(AAAAHH!)	[]
Stan	3	1	...What the fuck?!	['fuck']
Cartman	31	0	Aww, my mom is so poor she walked down the road with one shoooe.  And if you ask her if she lost a shoe, she'd say No, I found ooone.	[]
