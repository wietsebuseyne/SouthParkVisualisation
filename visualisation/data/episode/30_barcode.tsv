Mr. Garrison	46	0	Settle down, children. I have some difficult news. This is going to make you all very sad.  The school board is considering firing me as your teacher. There's a possibility that I will be let go and never allowed to teach you again.  Yes, Stanley?	[]
Stan	5	0	That's okay with us.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Kid	5	0	Yeah, we don't care.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Yeah, that's fine.	[]
Mr. Garrison	39	0	No it isn't, it makes you very sad! Now, apparently, the school board thinks that I don't teach you anything about current events, so tomorrow they're going to have you do presentations for the whole board.	[]
Class	1	0	Aawwww!	[]
Mr. Garrison	33	0	Current Events in South Park. Now, I want you all to read a newspaper, or better yet, watch television, and come up with something current in South Park to do a report on.	[]
Class	1	0	Aawwww!	[]
Mr. Garrison	47	0	Now, this'll be a group project, so I'm going to place you all into groups of five. Let's see, uh. Wendy, Bebe, Clyde, Pip, and Token , you'll be Group 1, and Group 2 will be Stan, Kyle, Eric, Kenny, a-and, and Tweek.	[]
Tweek	2	0	AAAghah heheh.	[]
Stan	3	0	Oh, not Tweek.	[]
Kyle	10	0	We don't wanna be in a group with Tweek.	[]
Mr. Garrison	17	0	There's nothing wrong with Tweek. I bet he'll do a great job in your group.	[]
Tweek	13	0	I can't take that kind of pressure. No, Sweet Jesus, ple-hehease!	[]
Stan	8	0	Dude, we can't work with this kid.	[]
Tweek	2	0	Yuh-ugh!	[]
Mr. Garrison	51	0	That's what Chad Everett thought when the new female intern joined the cast of Medical Center. He thought. Who is this woman with her gazungas and high heels? What does she know about medicine? Well, that intern soon saved Chad Everett's brother with a kidney transplant. So, you see?	[]
Stan	1	0	No.	[]
Mr. Garrison	43	2	Well, let me put it another way. You have to give your oral report to the entire South Park Town Committee tomorrow. And if it doesn't kick ass, and you make me look bad, Mr. Hat is gonna smack you bitches up!	['ass', 'bitches']
Tweek	1	0	Wagh!	[]
Richard Tweak	3	0	Hello there, customer.	[]
Customer	5	0	Hello. How are you today?	[]
Richard Tweak	11	0	Great. What can I get for you? Large coffee, small coffee?	[]
Customer	16	0	I'm actually interested in something else. I'm John Postum from the Harbucks Coffee Corporation...	[]
Richard Tweak	10	0	Oh, you're that corporate guy who's been calling.	[]
Postum	22	0	That's right. How come you don't call me back? All we wanna do is buy out your coffee shop here.	[]
Richard Tweak	10	0	Oh, forget it, my my store is not for sale.	[]
Postum	27	0	My company's prepared to make you a veerry generous offer.  This is a Cramsonite briefcase. All leather, it has four compartments and a keyless lock. Interested?	[]
Richard Tweak	15	0	Uh, I don't think so. My coffee shop is worth a lot to me.	[]
Postum	7	0	Well, all right.  How about $500,000?	[]
Richard Tweak	86	0	The answer is still no, Mr. Postum. You see, when my father opened this store 30 years ago, he cared about only one thing: making a great cup of coffee.  Sure, we may take a little longer to brew a cup, and we may not call it fancy names, but I guess we just care a little more.  And that's why Tweek Coffee is still home-brewed from the finest beans we can muster. Yes, Tweek Coffee is a simpler cup, for a simpler America.	[]
Postum	19	0	Well, that's too bad. We're just gonna have to open our Harbucks right next door to you.	[]
Richard Tweak	8	0	But that could put me out of business.	[]
Postum	11	0	Hey, this is a capitalist country, pal! Get used to it!	[]
Barbrady	3	0	Hello, Mr. Tweek.	[]
Richard Tweak	3	0	Hi, Officer Barbrady.	[]
Barbrady	3	0	Who was that?	[]
Richard Tweak	10	0	Oh, just some dong. What can I get for you.	[]
Barbrady	7	0	The usual.  Ogh. Thanks. See you tomorrow.	[]
Richard Tweak	2	0	Bye-bye.	[]
Stan	9	0	Okay, we have to do this stupid report, so--	[]
Tweek	6	0	AAAaaagh. Ugh, ugh, huh, aarrrnnn. Aaarrrhaharn.	[]
Stan	10	0	Sooo, let's figure out what to do it about.	[]
Cartman	16	0	How about we do it on that Raymond guy on TV, you know, Everybody Loves Raymond.	[]
Kyle	27	0	No, Cartman, we can't do it on Raymond again! It has to be on a current event in South Park. Tweek, do you have any ideas?	[]
Tweek	4	0	Uuurrnnn, too much pressure!	[]
Stan	8	0	Great. A lot of help you are, kid.	[]
Tweek	2	0	The gnomes!	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Tweek	8	0	We can do our report on the gnomes.	[]
Stan	2	0	What gnomes?	[]
Tweek	20	0	The underpants gnomes. The little guys that, that come into your room late, late at night and steal your underpants.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Oh, so that's where all my underpants go.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Dude, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.	[]
Stan	8	0	Yeah, I've never seen any underpants gnomes.	[]
Tweek	23	0	They come out at 3:30 in the morning. Most people aren't up then, but I am. I can't sleep. Ever.	[]
Kyle	21	0	Dude, we can't do a presentation on underpants gnomes. Mr. Garrison will fail us because you're making it up.	[]
Tweek	12	0	No!! Sleep at my house tonight; I'll prove it to you.	[]
Richard Tweak	13	0	They want me to sell the store, and it's so much money.	[]
Mrs. Tweak	25	0	Some things are more important than money.  The people of South Park count on you to give them that first cup of coffee every day.	[]
Richard Tweak	26	1	I know, but if they open a Harbucks right next door, we might go out of business. They really have my balls in a vice grip.	['balls']
Mrs. Tweak	7	0	Oh, hello, son. How was your day?	[]
Tweek	1	0	UUuuUunh!	[]
Mrs. Tweek	8	0	That's good. Who are your little friends?	[]
Tweek	4	0	What do you mean?!	[]
Kyle	6	0	We're his oral report buddies.	[]
Stan	11	0	Yeah, we have to stay up all night to write it.	[]
Mrs. Tweak	13	0	Well, have some coffee boys. I'll brew up another pot for later.	[]
Kyle	8	0	Coffee? I don't think I like coffee.	[]
Mrs. Tweak	9	0	Hoh, you'll like this coffee. It's fresh.	[]
Richard Tweak	8	0	Country fresh, like the morning after a rainstorm.	[]
Stan	27	0	'Kay. Maybe it'll help us figure out what to do our report on. We have to present it to the entire South Park town committee tomorrow.	[]
Richard Tweak	22	0	Oh. I've got one for you. How about doing a report on how large corporations take over little family-owned businesses.	[]
Mrs. Tweak	1	0	Richard!	[]
Richard Tweak	59	0	No, I'm- serious, hon. These boys should learn how the corporate machine is ruining America. You see, I own a coffee shop and now a great, big, multi-million dollar company is going to move in and try to take all my business, which means I may have to shut down and sell my son Tweek into slavery.	[]
Tweek	2	0	Mwaaah! Slavery?	[]
Richard Tweak	2	0	Yes, slavery.	[]
Stan	4	0	Wow, that sucks, dude.	[]
Richard Tweak	9	1	They really have my balls in a salad shooter.	['balls']
Kyle	11	0	We're already doing a paper on Tweek's underpants gnomes.	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Mrs. Tweak	24	0	Now, Tweek, how many times do we have to tell you? Your underpants are missing because you lose them, not because of underpants gnomes.	[]
Tweek	1	0	Uunnnnhh!	[]
Kyle	9	0	Come on, you guys! We better get to work!	[]
Richard Tweak	11	0	Wuh-okay, but corporate takeovers is a much more fertile subject.	[]
Mrs. Tweak	16	0	Honestly, Richard. I don't see why you have to preach to some eight-year olds.	[]
Richard Tweak	17	0	Actually, honey, I think those little tykes are just what we need. I've got an idea.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Man, this stuff is strong.	[]
Stan	3	0	Kind of bitter.	[]
Tweek	13	0	What if my parents go out of business? Uh what'll I do?	[]
Kyle	5	0	Don't worry about it.	[]
Tweek	8	0	But we'll starve and die like dogs.	[]
Cartman	24	0	Tweek, Tweek, you can always go on welfare. Look at Kenny's family: they're perfectly happy being poor and on welfare. Right, Kenny?	[]
Kenny	2	1	(Fuck you!)	['fuck']
Cartman	4	0	Heheh, you suck, Kenny.	[]
Kyle	15	0	Well, let's just try to finish all this coffee, so we can stay up.	[]
Stan	1	0	Aooooo!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Woohoo!	[]
Kenny	6	0	(Let me try! Let me try!)	[]
Stan	4	0	Yeess, this stuff rocks!	[]
Kyle	5	0	Totally, dudes! I feel awesome!	[]
Stan	1	0	Whoopee!	[]
Kenny	6	0	(Look at me! Look at me!)	[]
Cartman	13	0	You guys! You guys! Seriously! I'm a sorcerer! Zhyagah, zhyah, zhyagot that.	[]
Kyle	8	0	Hey, Tweek, you got anymore of this stuff?	[]
Tweek	4	0	I just have grounds.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Killer!!	[]
Cartman	6	0	Ey, let me have some grounds.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Gross, Cartman. Whoopee!	[]
Kyle	4	0	Hogh, my stomach hurts.	[]
Stan	6	0	Yeah, mine too. I wonder why.	[]
Kyle	15	1	Well, it's 3:30; I don't see any god-damned underpants gnomes, Tweek.	['damned']
Tweek	21	0	Urgh. Uh maybe, maybe it was all in my head. Maybe I'm going insane! Oh no I'm going insane!	[]
Stan	16	0	Well, this is just great! We haven't gotten anything done, and we're totally screwed!	[]
Richard Tweak	6	0	How's the report going, boys?	[]
Stan	1	0	Bad!	[]
Richard Tweak	7	0	Oh, do you need some more coffee?	[]
Boys	1	0	Eugh.	[]
Cartman	4	0	No...more...coffee. Blech.	[]
Richard Tweak	20	0	Well, boys, uh. I don't mean to pry, but, if you want it, I wrote your report for you.	[]
All	2	0	You did?!	[]
Richard Tweak	16	0	Yes, it's all about corporate takeovers. Of course, you don't have to use it.	[]
Stan	5	0	No, we'll use it.	[]
Richard Tweak	14	0	All right.  And it can be our little secret about who wrote it, right?	[]
Kyle	1	0	Sure.	[]
Richard Tweak	16	0	Now, when you give the report,  just make sure that you read this part first, okay?	[]
Tweek	3	0	There they are!	[]
Richard Tweak	43	0	And when you come up to do it a second time, really, really clear it up, I mean, um, really, really play the sympathy angle. They'll like that. They'll be calling you, and you'll get a passing grade for it.	[]
Tweek	8	0	You guys, look! Look! You're missing it!	[]
Tweek	5	0	Arrgghh! They took them again!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Thanks, dude.	[]
Richard Tweak	5	0	My pleasure. G'night, boys.	[]
Stan	5	0	Wow, Tweek, your dad rocks!	[]
Tweek	14	0	Why do they torture me like this?! Why can't they leave me alone?!	[]
Kyle	9	2	Damnit! What the hell is wrong with you, Tweek?!	['damnit', 'hell']
Tweek	13	0	They took my underpants again! Soon they'll want my blood! Blood! Euuggh!	[]
Kyle	12	0	And as the voluminous corporate automaton bulldozes its way through bantam America...	[]
Cartman	8	0	What will become of the endeavoring American family?	[]
Mr. Garrison	9	0	I don't think they wrote this, Mr. Hat.	[]
Stan	8	0	Perhaps there is no stopping the corporate machine.	[]
Tweek	1	0	Uurrgh!	[]
Kyle	7	0	And that's our report, I guess.	[]
Mr. Garrison	9	0	Well, boys, it's obvious you didn't even--	[]
Lady Member	2	0	Great job!	[]
Mr. Garrison	3	0	Yes, great job.	[]
Lady Member	15	0	Boys, you have really opened our eyes. We didn't even know this was happening.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Neither did we.	[]
Lady Member	18	0	Well, Mr. Garrison, it looks like we were wrong about you. You really are teaching these kids something.	[]
Mr. Garrison	16	1	Yeah, well, I don't want to sound like a dickhole, but I told you so.	['dickhole']
Lady Member	27	0	Aw, I am really moved. I say we follow these boys's cause. Let's join them in the fight against corporate takeovers!  Lead the way, boys!	[]
Stan	1	0	Huh??	[]
Tweek	6	0	Uunh, it's too much pressure!	[]
Postum	13	0	Good! Good! Now, make sure that sign is really bright and flashy now.	[]
Mrs. Tweak	12	0	My goodness. That's going to be a huge coffee house, honey.	[]
Richard Tweak	21	1	Yes, it is.  They really have my balls in a juice maker.  Oh, hello, son, uh. How did your report go?	['balls']
Tweek	1	0	Waagh!	[]
Kyle	12	0	I think it went really good. Those people really got into it.	[]
Richard Tweak	19	0	Really?? Well, son, you might have just saved the family business. What do you have to say about that?	[]
Tweek	3	0	I need coffee.	[]
Richard Tweak	69	0	I know how you boys feel.  Sometimes a hot cup of French Roast Amaretto is just what a man needs to get him through the day. That smooth aroma and mild taste is what make Tweek coffee...  uh very special. Special, like an Arizona sunrise or a juniper wet with dew. A light rain in the middle of a dusty afternoon or a hug from your dear old aunt-- .	[]
Tweek	1	0	Dad!	[]
Richard Tweak	1	0	What?	[]
Tweek	3	0	The metaphors, man!	[]
Richard Tweak	5	0	Oh, sorry. Here you go.	[]
Kyle	13	0	Hey. Do you ever think maybe you shouldn't give your son coffee?	[]
Mrs. Tweak	5	0	Liike, how do you mean?	[]
Kyle	10	0	Like look at him. He's always shaking and nervous.	[]
Tweek	1	0	Agghh!	[]
Mrs. Tweak	18	0	Oh, that. He has ADD, attention deficit disorder. That's why he's so jittery all the time.	[]
Lady Member	7	0	Mr. Tweek, we've only just heard.	[]
Richard Tweak	7	0	Oh, hello committee members. What a surprise.	[]
Lady Member	13	0	So, this is the corporate bulldozer trying to push you off the map.	[]
Mr. Tweek	5	0	Yes. How did you hear?	[]
Lady Member 2	18	0	These boys did an excellent report for us this morning. They're so upset by this whole thing	[]
Kyle	3	1	My butt hurts.	['butt']
Lady Member	35	2	Don't worry, Mr. Tweek. This committee is not going to let you be run out of business by these bastards! Do you hear that? You're not gonna get away with this, you whore!	['bastards', 'whore']
Postum	2	0	Excuse me?!	[]
Lady Member 2	17	0	Boys, we've talked it over, and we want you to take your case to the mayor!	[]
Stan	2	0	Our case?	[]
Tweek	10	0	Uuhhh, no way, man! That is way too much pressure!	[]
Richard Tweak	6	0	Oh, you'll do fine, son.	[]
Lady Member 2	6	0	Come on, boys! Let's go!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Aw, man, this sucks!	[]
Tweek	1	0	Aaarrrnnn!	[]
Lady Member	18	0	...And we would have never even known that this was happening if not for these boys' excellent report.	[]
Mayor	23	0	You're telling me that students from Mr. Garrison's class actually did something that had some kind of relevance to the world?	[]
Lady Member	3	0	That's right.	[]
Mayor	7	0	Mr. Garrison, the guy with the puppet?	[]
Lady Member	1	0	Yes!	[]
Mayor	20	0	Well, I must say, Garrison, perhaps you're not as stupid and crazy as I always tell people you are.	[]
Mr. Garrison	13	1	Thank you, Mayor. I don't wanna sound like a dickhole, but I-	['dickhole']
Lady Member	11	0	Mayor, these boys want that Harbucks coffee shut down right now!	[]
Male Member	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Lady Member 2	1	0	Hyeah!	[]
Mayor	13	0	Well, I can't just shut them down, this is a free country.	[]
Lady Member	6	0	But they're ruining our city!	[]
Mayor	33	0	Look, the best I can do is create a proposition. We'll call it Prop. 10. The town can vote on it, and if it passes, we'll see what we can do.	[]
Blond Member	1	0	Hooray!	[]
The Other Members	1	0	Hooray!	[]
Lady Member	11	0	What do you say, boys? We're gonna pass a law!	[]
Stan	2	0	Uh... Hooray.	[]
Mayor	40	0	So I guess you wanna do some campaigning.  You can do commercials and things like that, and then we'll have a vote in the middle of town. And obviously, if more than 50% of the people even show up...	[]
Tweek	1	0	Wagh!	[]
Mayor	16	0	...and care enough to want Harbucks out, then, they're out. So, good luck to you.	[]
Tweek	5	0	Didn't you see them!?	[]
Mayor	5	0	All right, what's next.	[]
Ted	6	0	Next is issue 37D, missing underpants.	[]
Johnson	5	0	Is it cold in here?	[]
Mr. Garrison	80	0	Uh, boys, can I have a quick this and that with you? Boys, I don't know who wrote that report, but now that you've convinced everybody, you'd better stick with it. 'Cause if these people find out you didn't really write that paper, and I actually do get fired, then Mr. Hat is gonna do horrible things to you.  Oh, not that, Mr. Hat! That's really horrible! Anyway, good luck passing your new law, boys.	[]
Tweek	9	0	Jesus, man, Jesus! What are we gonna do, huh?!	[]
Tweek	9	0	Jesus, man, Jesus! What are we gonna do, huh?!	[]
Host	17	0	Live, it's the South Park Town Hall Meeting on Public Access. Tonight's topic: Prop. 10.	[]
Mediator	39	1	Should Harbucks be allowed to open a store in South Park? That's tonight's topic. On my left, five innocent, starry-eyed boys from Middle America.  On my right, a big, fat, smelly corporate guy from New York.	['fat']
Audience	1	0	Boo!	[]
Postum	7	1	Hey, I'm not fat or smelly!	['fat']
Mediator	4	1	All right, Mr. Douchebag.	['douchebag']
Postum	1	0	Postum!	[]
Mediator	14	1	Oh. Pardon me, Mr. Assface. Anyway, let's hear your side of the argument.	['assface']
Audience	1	0	Boo!	[]
Postum	16	0	My argument is simple. This country's founded on free enterprise. Harbucks is an organization that--	[]
Audience	1	0	Hhssssssss!	[]
Postem	17	1	An organization that prides itself on great coffee! We simply want tuh-- Oh, to hell with you!	['hell']
Mediator	33	0	Okay, ucka-fay. Now for the other side of the argument we turn to our young, handsome lads.  Boys, your thoughts.  Come on, boys, don't be shy. What's your principal argument?	[]
Kyle	1	0	Uh...	[]
Stan	1	0	Uh...	[]
Cartman	4	1	This guy sucks ass!	['ass']
Audience	3	0	Yeah! Yeah! Woo!	[]
Mediator	5	0	Great argument! You win, boys!	[]
Postum	1	0	What?!	[]
Mr. Garrison	5	0	That was close, Mr. Hat.	[]
Voice-over	30	0	What is the future of America? Is it the money we make?  The quests we conquer?  No, it's children.  So what do children have to say about Prop. 10?	[]
Kyle	6	0	I don't like big corporations.	[]
Stan	4	0	I like small businesses.	[]
Cartman	7	0	I believe in the family-owned enterprise.	[]
Kenny	8	0	(In my family, it's a silly enterprise.)	[]
Tweek	1	0	Aarrgghh!	[]
Voice-over	55	0	It's time to stop large corporations. Prop. 10 is about children. Vote Yes on Prop. 10, or else, you hate children. You don't hate... children... do you? Remember, keep American business small, or else.  Paid for by Citizens for a Fair and Equal way to get Harbucks Coffee kicked out of town forever.	[]
Lady Member	5	0	Well, what do you think?	[]
Richard Tweak	5	0	Wow, it it's great!	[]
Lady Member	11	0	Yes it is. We'll put it on the air immediately.	[]
Richard Tweak	10	0	What do you think, hon?  Hon? What's the matter?	[]
Mrs. Tweak	7	0	I have a big problem with this.	[]
Richard Tweak	4	0	What do you mean?	[]
Mrs. Tweak	17	0	We are just using those boys for our benefit. They have no idea what they're saying.	[]
Richard Tweak	10	0	But, kids are great to get people on our side.	[]
Mrs. Tweak	24	0	You don't just throw a child in a political commercial to sell your beliefs. I won't be a part of this anymore.	[]
Richard Tweak	13	0	Honey, all's fair in love and war.  And coffee. Hon? Hu-hon?	[]
Lady Protester	11	0	Take your corporate coffee and go back to New York City!	[]
Crowd	1	0	Yeah!!	[]
Blonde Protester	11	0	It's people like you who are ruining Main Street, USA!	[]
Crowd	4	0	That's right! Yeah!	[]
Lady Protester	12	0	How many Native Americans did you slaughter to make that coffee, huh?!	[]
Crowd	1	0	Yeah!!	[]
Postum	19	1	Damn, these people aren't buying any coffee! I'll have to try and appeal to the younger crowd.	['damn']
Postum	54	0	Hey, kids. I'm Camel Joe and I love a fresh cup of coffee. It's yum diddly-icious, and it makes you feel super!  I have a surprise for you: the new Kiddicino from Harbucks; more sugar and all the other goodies kids like with all the caffeine of a normal double latte.	[]
Kid's Mom	19	0	No Billy, no coffee for you.  You should be ashamed of yourself, using cartoons to push caffeine on children!	[]
Postum	14	0	Why don't you go back to the hole you crawled out from, lady?!	[]
Richard Tweak	16	0	Uh, Mr. Postum, I'm afraid you've got a lot to learn about making coffee.	[]
Postum	14	0	Oh, and you don't? Your coffee tastes like three-day-old moldy diarrhea!	[]
Richard Tweak	28	0	Uh I'm sorry to inform you that this town is having a vote tomorrow, and if the law passes, you're gonna be thrown out of town.	[]
Postum	1	0	What?!	[]
Richard Tweak	41	0	At five o'clock, the best coffee wins. Either your coffee, or a fresh, warm cup of... Tweek's coffee.  Like an old sweater that keeps getting warmer with age, you can count on Tweek's coffee to start your day.	[]
Mayor	36	0	Tomorrow, for the Prop. 10 vote, we'll set up ballot booths... here.  All right, men, we'll throw up the stage here. Before the vote we'll get a band everyone likes, like uhhhh, like...	[]
Johnson	1	0	Toto.	[]
Mayor	28	0	Like Toto. And then the Harbuck's guy will have five minutes to speak and the boys will have five minutes to speak, and then the town votes.	[]
Mr. Garrison	9	1	Uh, boys, you better get your asses to work.	['asses']
Cartman	2	0	What now?	[]
Mr. Garrison	21	0	They're expecting you to give a big speech on corporate takeovers, and this time it has to last five minutes.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Oh, God, when is this gonna end?	[]
Stan	6	0	Your dad really screwed us, Tweek!	[]
Tweek	15	0	Jesus, dude! I'm to blame for all this! I'm to blame for everything!	[]
Kyle	6	0	So what are we gonna say?	[]
Cartman	12	0	Why can't we just read the paper we wrote last time?	[]
Stan	16	0	'Cause then they'll know we didn't write it, dummy! We have to be original!	[]
Kyle	6	0	Does anybody know anything about corporations?	[]
Tweek	1	0	Waagh!	[]
Cartman	7	0	I think my mom is a corporation.	[]
Stan	4	0	Yeah, that makes sense.	[]
Tweek	3	0	You guys! Sshhhh!	[]
Kyle	10	0	Well, how about we just say, corporates should be stopped?	[]
Stan	8	0	How do we stretch that into five minutes?	[]
Tweek	5	0	They're taking my underpants!	[]
Kyle	13	0	Will you stop with the underpants gnomes, Tweek?! We have to work here!	[]
Tweek	1	0	Aaaggghhh!	[]
Stan	3	1	What the hell?	['hell']
Cartman	5	1	Well, I'll be damned.	['damned']
Tweek	7	0	That's my last pair of underpants!	[]
Kyle	5	0	Sshh, don't scare him.	[]
Stan	4	0	Hey there, little guy.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Bad!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Cartman!	[]
Cartman	1	0	What?!	[]
Kyle	11	0	Why do you always have to hit stuff with a stick?!	[]
Cartman	14	0	Well, look at him. He's all, you know, uh l-look at him.	[]
Gnome	7	1	Is that all you've got, pussy?	['pussy']
Cartman	1	0	What?!	[]
Stan	3	0	Hey, he talks!	[]
Cartman	15	3	Yeah, he called me a pussy! I'm not a pussy, you're a pussy!	['pussy', 'pussy', 'pussy']

Postum	27	0	Well, it looks like Harbucks will never make it in this town.  All right, boys, that's it. Pack it up, we're movin' out of town.	[]
Worker 1	5	0	Aw, but we just finished.	[]
Postum	11	0	I know, but these folks obviously don't want us here.	[]

Gnome	8	0	This is where all our work is done.	[]
Cartman	13	0	So what are you gonna do with all these underpants that you steal?	[]

Kyle	5	0	Sooo, what's phase 2?	[]
Gnome	5	0	Hey, what's phase 2?	[]

Gnome	8	0	Yeah yeah yeah, but, what about phase 2?	[]
Gnome 2	7	0	Well, phase 3 is profit. Get it?	[]
Stan	5	0	I don't get it.	[]
Gnome 2	11	0	You see,Phase 1: collect underpants. Phase 2: ... Phase 3: Profit.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Oh, I get it.	[]
Stan	5	0	No you don't, fatass!	[]

Lady Member	4	0	Toto, ladies and gentlemen!	[]
Prop. 10 Supporter	5	0	Yeah, Toto! Whoo, Toto! Woo!	[]
Lady Member	22	0	All right. And now, before we all vote yes on Prop. 10, here to remind us why are the lovable, innocent children.	[]
Stan	27	0	Uh. Since we are so concerned with the corporate takeovers, we went and asked our friends, the underpants gnomes, and they told us all about big corporations.	[]
Supporter	2	0	Underpants gnomes?	[]
Kyle	4	0	Big corporations are good!	[]
Supporter	1	0	What?	[]
Supporter 2	3	0	What's this?	[]
Supporter 3	1	0	Good?	[]
Kyle	16	0	Because without big corporations we wouldn't have things like cars and computers and canned soup.	[]
Stan	50	0	Even Harbucks Coffee started off as a small, little business. But because it made such great coffee, and because they ran their business so well, they managed to grow and grow until it became the corporate powerhouse it is today. And that is why we should all let Harbucks stay!	[]
Townsman	1	0	Ogh.	[]
Lady Member	8	0	That's not what you said last time.	[]
Kyle	13	0	Uuuh. Well, the truth is, we didn't write that paper last time.	[]
Mr. Garrison	12	0	You little turds!! You've ruined my life for the last time!!	[]
Mrs. Tweak	71	0	These boys are absolutely right. We've been using these poor kids to pull at your heartstrings for our cause, and it's wrong. We're as low and despicable as Rob Reiner. You keep protesting and complaining, but did any of you ever even bother to taste Harbucks coffee?  Harbucks coffee got to where it is by being the best. Don't you think you should at least try it?	[]
Townsman	6	1	Hey, this is pretty damn good.	['damn']
Townsman 2	15	0	Yeah, it doesn't have that bland, raw, sewage taste that Tweek's coffee has.	[]
Richard Tweak	5	0	Hey. Hey, that is good.	[]
Postum	5	0	It's a French roast.	[]
Richard Tweak	25	0	It's subtle and mild. Mild, like that first splash of sun on an April  morning. This coffee is coffee the way it should be.	[]
Postum	26	0	Hehey, no hard feelings, Tweek. You know, we still need someone to run this Harbucks coffeehouse. I'm sure it will make a lot of money.	[]
Richard Tweak	21	0	Thank you, Mr. Postum, but I think we'll be happy with the money we make selling our son into slavery.	[]
Tweek	1	0	Aggghhh!	[]
Richard Tweak	3	0	Just kidding, son.	[]
Cartman	4	0	I love you guys.	[]
