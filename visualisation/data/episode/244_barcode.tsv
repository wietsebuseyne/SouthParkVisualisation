Guard 1	82	0	The holiday season... is here, and Black Friday... is upon us. As you know, black Friday is the day shoppers go berserk for holiday deals. Last year, 26 people died, and 461 were seriously injured.__This winter the mall is offering 80% off to the first twenty people in the store.__For you new recruits, perhaps you took this job to see just what the violence was like.__Or perhaps you thought workin' Black Friday wouldn't be a big deal._	[]
Randy	10	0	I'm just trying to earn some extra holiday cash.	[]
Guard 1	15	0	Or maybe you're just too stupid to realize what you've gotten yourselves into.	[]
Chief of Security	47	0	That's enough!__Our only chance of surviving this year's sale is by sticking together! Those of you who signed up are to be... commended.__But I warn you: do not underestimate the battle that's about to take place outside those doors!__Winter is coming.	[]
Cartman	19	0	Good evening, sir. I'm calling together all the fighters of Zauron. I need to speak with Lady McCormick.	[]
Kenny	6	0	(She's not here right now.)	[]
Cartman	33	0	Please tell her there is to be a meeting in the Great Hall. I have found a way to get XBox Ones, and the fair Lady McCormick will want to hear about it.	[]
Cartman	57	0	Thank you all for coming. Prince Token, Sir Timmy of Blacklake, Lady McCormick_. Warriors, we have fought many great battles together. At Clyde's house. At Scott Malkinson's house. But soon we will be fighting the greatest battle of our young hot lives. Winter is coming, and the next gen gaming devices are hitting the shelves.	[]
Clyde	4	0	Which nobody can afford.	[]
Cartman	22	0	What if I were to tell you that if we all worked together there's a way we_can_get the new gaming system.	[]
Token	9	0	If you know of a way, wizard, then speak.	[]
Cartman	32	0	I have learned of a dark magic at work. The day after Thanksgiving, the first thirty people inside the mall get 80% off whatever they want. They are calling it... Black Friday.	[]
Butters	2	0	Woo, spooky.	[]
Craig	9	0	Black Friday? Come on, that can't be real.	[]
Cartman	9	1	It_is_real, Craig! I saw it on the news, butthole!	['butthole']
Stan	26	0	It_is_real. They do it every year. But everyone in town tries to be the first inside the mall on Black Friday. What chance do we have?	[]
Cartman	36	0	On our own, none. But if we plan, strategize, and fight together!__...We can be the first people inside on Black Friday. And use the 80% to get the gaming system we need to survive.	[]
Male Anchor	12	0	Well it's almost Thanksgiving, and we all know what that means.	[]
Female Anchor	10	0	That's right. Black Friday is right around the corner.	[]
Male Anchor	1	0	Ouch.	[]
Female Anchor	7	0	And people are already gearing up._	[]
Shopper 1	28	0	We usually start linin' up around 3 am. We uh douse ourselves in pig blood, because it does help us slip through the crowd when the doors open.	[]
Shopper 2	43	0	We do it every year, part of the family tradition. Last year we lost our youngest daughter. He head was stepped on and crushed, but, in her memory, we're going to find a young girl and step on her head this year.	[]
Shopper 3	34	3	If anyone thinks they're gonna beat me inside that mall, and keep me from gettin'__my kids Christmas presents, they can kiss my fat vagina, 'cause I'm bringin' the motherfuckin' pain!_	['fat', 'vagina', 'motherfuckin']
Reporter	33	0	Tom, the South Park Mall says they've beefed up security in an effort to reduce the number of fatalities this year. One thing's for sure, people take Black Friday very seriously.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Yes. Yes, very nice. Good.	[]
Butters	11	0	Wizard Cartman! I have news from the Internet, my lord!_	[]
Cartman	9	0	They don't salute in Game of Thrones, Butters.	[]
Butters	8	0	Uh, sorry, I haven't watched it yet.	[]
Cartman	20	0	Okay, we need to start immediately, please.__Ah, very good. The House of Greyhawk has agreed to join our fight!	[]
Stan	4	0	The House of Greyhawk?	[]
Kyle	4	0	Larry and Brad Stoltsky	[]
Cartman	25	0	But my friends, we must still find others who will fight by our side! Are there no other factions we can call to our aid?	[]
Clyde	14	0	Hey yeah, I know.__How about we ask those kids who play Star Trek?	[]
Cartman	15	0	Uhh noo! Screw those guys. They're dorks, and I'm not playing with them.	[]
Randy	25	0	Hey,__that's what I'm talkin' about. You got any extra of that?__Oh, thanks!__Gets a little boring around here, you know?_	[]
Guard 2	6	0	Enjoy the boredom while you can.	[]
Randy	12	0	So you worked here last winter? You worked on Black Friday?_	[]
Guard 2	2	0	I did.	[]
Randy	10	0	Is it really as bad as they say it is?	[]
Guard 2	144	0	The shoppers... Hm... They started showing up at midnight on Thursday... They... didn't line up, they just crammed themselves near the main entrance... I can see their faces smooshed up against the glass, licking their lips, waiting to get in... God, the sounds that they made... It was 5 am when they opened the doors... There was screaming... blood... people... tearing each other's faces off while holiday music played in the background... I saw a woman... pick up her daughter by the ankle and swing her into some old guy's head... Before I knew it they were all around me... fighting, clawing. Then a hand reached in and pulled me out. Old Cap. He saved us all that day.__When it was over... the front of the mall was... covered in red. Bodies... shopping bags...__And now winter comes again._	[]
Butters	9	0	Well Wizard Cartman, I started watching Game of Thrones.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Ah yes, Paladin Butters, are you enjoying it?	[]
Butters	30	2	Well it's it's pretty good, I guess, but have you ever noticed that almost every time they show a guy's wiener, that guy's character is gay?	['wiener', 'gay']
Cartman	4	0	What do you mean?	[]
Butters	54	5	Well ih-it's just that they have a lot of girls' boobs and vagina's and stuff, but most times they show a man's wiener, it's because that guy's in a love scene with another guy. Do you think it's because gay wieners are less threatening to women viewers?	['boobs', 'vagina', 'wiener', 'gay', 'wieners']
Cartman	14	0	Iiii believe you might be missing the greater point of the show, Paladin Butters.	[]
Butters	32	2	Yeah, I know. Winter is comin' and there's dragons and zombies on the way. I'm pretty excited for that. Just could do with a little less gay wiener is all.	['gay', 'wiener']
Cartman	13	0	We have word from the kindergartners. They've agreed to join us!_	[]
Kyle	8	0	Those XBox Ones are as good as ours!	[]
Boys	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Craig	10	0	Wait, wait. What are you talking about, XBox Ones?_	[]
Cartman	19	0	That's what this is all about, Craig. We're all trying to get XBox Ones on Black Friday.	[]
Craig	8	0	I thought we were getting Playstation 4's.	[]
Cartman	1	0	What?	[]
Jimmy	6	0	M ma um m-me too.	[]
Cartman	20	0	...Nnnoo. Guys, when I said we're gonna get the next gen gaming systems, I was obviously talking about XBoxes.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Jimmy	10	1	Eh but I want a PS4, not a crappy XBox.	['crappy']
Kyle	10	0	Look, guys, we all have to agree on one system.	[]
Cartman	3	0	That's right.	[]
Kyle	33	0	If some of us are on PS4s, but the rest of us are on XBox's, then we all can't play together online. See? This is all about committing to one machine.	[]
Craig	6	0	Right. Let's all get PS4s.	[]
Kyle	8	0	No, the XBox's are gonna be better.	[]
Tweek	9	0	They're not better, they're just more expensive.	[]
Cartman	10	0	We are getting XBox Ones, guys! And that is final!	[]
Craig	7	0	That's exactly how XBox people are!	[]
Jimmy	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Cartman	19	0	Fine! If you guys don't wanna join us on Black Friday to get XBoxes, then that's fine!	[]
Craig	12	0	We're still gonna fight on Black Friday, just not with you!	[]
Cartman	9	0	Oh, it's gonna be like that, is it?!	[]
Craig	10	0	Everyone who wants to get PS4s, join with us!_	[]
Kyle	14	0	No! We can't divide like this!__Stan?__You're on our side, right?	[]
Stan	7	0	I like the PS4's controller better.	[]
Kyle	18	0	Stan, the PS4 doesn't have the seamless transition between games, movies, and TV offered by XBox One.	[]
Stan	42	0	The PS4 has a touchpad interface. You never listened. I told you I thought the PS4 was better, but you never wanted to listen to me, Kyle. You just had your head so set because...__because that's how XBox people are.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Then I guess I'll see you on Black Friday.	[]
Stan	17	0	If I see you at the mall, Kyle, I will have to try to beat you inside.	[]
Kyle	2	0	I know.	[]
Cartman	15	1	Come on, Kyle. Let these Sony fucks wallow in their limited voice-control functionality._	['fucks']
Randy	18	1	Christmas is coming, the goose is getting fat.__Please to put a penny in the old man's-	['fat']
Sharon	6	1	What the hell are you doing?	['hell']
Randy	28	0	Oh hey Sharon. You're up, huh? I uh... alright, look: I took a temp job at the mall. I just wanted to make some extra holiday cash.	[]
Sharon	1	1	Bullshit.	['bullshit']
Randy	22	0	I did, Sharon.__I saw they were hiring extra security, and I thought it'd be a good way to make money.	[]
Sharon	20	0	You're doing this to try and get to the front of the line on Black Friday, aren't you?	[]
Randy	55	0	Nobody else has thought of it, Sharon. I won't even be out in the crowd. I'll be on the inside when the doors open. While everyone is trying to run over each other, I'll turn around and run right into the stores. I'll be the first to get whatever I want!	[]
Sharon	13	0	Isn't Black Friday supposed to be about buying things for other people?	[]
Randy	14	0	Winter is coming, Sharon, and I'm a sneaky little bee.__Bzzz bzzz._	[]
Ensign	5	0	Thrusters are at 20%, captain.	[]
Kevin	5	0	Engage, ensign. Warp factor 1.	[]
Dougie	10	0	Captain, we have an incoming FaceTime request from Eric Cartman.	[]
Kevin	3	0	On screen._	[]
Cartman	7	0	Oh uh, hey guys, what's up?	[]
Kevin	20	0	Nothin' much. We're just about to check out a Class M planet that might have new sources of trillurillium.	[]
Cartman	6	0	God these guys are such dorks!	[]
Clyde	8	0	Just find out who they're loyal to.	[]
Cartman	16	0	Uh yeah, big dong and prosper. Um, listen guys, uh, uh, you're XBox people, right?	[]
Kevin	21	0	Given the XBox's faster frame rate, we have no choice but to declare it the most technologically fit for Starfleet.	[]
Cartman	32	0	Oh my god they're so gaaay!__Um, kewl. What if I were to tell you that we have a way for you to join us in getting XBox Ones super cheap.	[]
Dougie	5	0	Cheap XBox Ones? For real?	[]
Cartman	38	0	The Federation has agreed to fight with us!__With them and the kindergartners, our army has just doubled in size!__You still think you can convince Stan to come back to our side, don't you, Sir Kyle?	[]
Kyle	4	0	I don't know.	[]
Cartman	30	0	You can't change his mind, Sir Kyle. Sony people don't think with logic. He betrayed us. And now we must out-Game of Thrones_him by making powerful alliances.	[]
Butters	85	10	Oh don't even get me started! I keep watchin' that show and I'm waitin' for the darn dragon to show up and, and kick everyone's butt! But all I get is wiener, wiener, wiener. It's not all gay wiener, but when they DO show a straight guy's wiener, it's all soft and floppy. Even though he just got done humpin' a pretty girl! Why is that? Because a soft wiener isn't threatening, just like a gay wiener._	['butt', 'wiener', 'wiener', 'wiener', 'gay', 'wiener', 'wiener', 'wiener', 'gay', 'wiener']
Cartman	9	1	Butters, you seem to be somewhat obsessed with wieners.	['wieners']
Butters	9	1	I'm obsessed with wieners? Well what about HBO?	['wieners']
Kyle	6	0	This isn't helping us, Butters!	[]
Clyde	9	0	The Sony people might not be our biggest problem.	[]
Kenny	4	0	(What do you mean?)	[]
Clyde	11	0	Twitter says they're introducing a new Elmo doll this Christmas.	[]
Cartman	4	0	What new Elmo doll?	[]
Elmo	3	0	Heheh, who, me?	[]
Announcer	29	0	Just in time for the holidays, it's Stop Touching Me Elmo.__When you press his back, Elmo puts his hand on your knee and says fun things._	[]
Elmo	31	0	Have you ever been tickled on the inside?__I'm lonely. Are you lonely?__Can I watch you go potty?__You wanna kiss the guy who does Elmo's voice?_	[]
Girl	5	0	Stop touching me, Elmo!_	[]
Announcer	12	0	Elmo also helps kids brush their teeth with his toothpaste dispenser._	[]
Elmo	4	0	More! More! More! Aaaghghgh.	[]

Randy	3	0	Morning, Joe, Marcus.	[]
Guard 3	2	0	Morning, Randy.	[]
Old Cap	5	0	What madness is this??_	[]
Randy	3	0	What is it?	[]
Old Cap	16	0	A new Elmo doll. They're releasing a new Emo doll__just in time for Black Friday.	[]
Guard 3	3	0	Oh Christ, no!	[]
Old Cap	13	0	You've murdered us!__You soulless monsters, you've killed us all!_	[]
Guard 4	7	0	Oh, God, they're already lining up.	[]
Shopper 1	1	0	Eelllmoooo	[]
Guard 3	11	0	No! They can't line up this soon! This is crazy!	[]
Old Cap	23	0	I'll deal with these demons!__If you are here for Black Friday, the line starts on that side of the rope._	[]
Shopper 4	6	0	Oh. This rope right here?_	[]
Old Cap	15	0	That's the line for Black Friday, so other people can do normal shopping today.	[]
Shopper 4	4	0	Oh. Okay. Thanks._	[]
Shopper 4	1	0	Elmooo.	[]
Shopper 5	3	0	Give me Elmo.	[]
Stan	25	0	We come seeking your help. Do you side with those wanting XBoxe's, or will you join us on Black Friday and fight for PS4s?	[]
Michael	4	0	Are you for real?	[]
Jimmy	13	0	You know that the PS4 is a better choice. I mean, come on.	[]
Michael	13	0	Of course we're going to go with the PS4. They're blacker!	[]
Stan	16	0	Then join us! We need people to help us be the first 20 inside the mall!	[]
Pete	14	0	Uhhh, we're just gonna wait until the PS4s become cheaper and more available.	[]
Stan	6	0	No, you can't do that!	[]
Jimmy	10	0	Ya yo you can't, you can't do that.	[]
Stan	46	0	Don't you see this is about more than Black Friday? Battle lines are being drawn! If you wait it out, but everyone else has already decided to go with XBox, then, that will become the standard! The PS4 would be like Betamax was to VHS.	[]
Henrietta	3	0	What's Betamax?	[]
Stan	1	0	Exactly!	[]
Pete	3	0	What's VHS?	[]
Stan	19	0	...Look, we're just asking people who want to play on PS4s to fight for what they believe in!	[]
Michael	9	0	Sorry, I guess we just don't care enough.	[]
Jimmy	14	0	Come on, Sir Stan. There must be kids somewhere who will join us._	[]
Cartman	12	0	Lady McCormick, I was hoping I could talk to you about Kyle.	[]
Kenny	6	0	(Yes. What's up, my lord?)	[]
Cartman	28	0	I'm not sure if his heart is in the right place. If he were to ever...__switch sides,__it could make Stan's army problematic for us.	[]
Kenny	7	0	(But Stan and Kyle are best friends)	[]
Cartman	44	0	True, but we can't let Kyle come in the way of what's rightfully ours.__Let's face it, Lady McCormick, this is really about you and me getting XBox Ones. The others are simply there to... help us get inside those doors.	[]
Kenny	5	0	(Yes. That's right.)_	[]
Cartman	41	0	You have a strong influence over the rest of the men, Lady McCormick. All I'm saying is when the time comes, I might need you to... use that influence to have Kyle taken care of. Do we understand each other?	[]
Kenny	5	0	(Yes, I believe we do.)	[]
Man	11	2	Hey, you damned kids!__Get the hell out of my yard!	['damned', 'hell']
Cartman	9	1	Fuck you, dude! This is the Garden of Andros!	['fuck']

Randy	23	0	Seventy-inch television. Huh that would be good. Oooo, but 80% off a computer. Huh, maybe I'll be able to snag both.	[]
Voice	5	0	Doin' alright there, Rookie?_	[]
Randy	4	0	Whoa! Haha.__Yes sir!	[]
Old Cap	8	0	Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.	[]
Randy	16	0	No, I was just uh, looking at all these great things I can't afford, heh.	[]
Old Cap	11	0	Listen, uh... I know why you took this part-time job.	[]
Randy	4	0	You-d, you do?	[]
Old Cap	80	0	I see it in you. You care about people.__Same reason I do it every year.__You remind me of my son. He died on Black Friday in '89. Guess I'm still trying to save him.__Look, I just want to say I... I really appreciate what you're doing. I promised my wife this would be my last Black Friday I worked. When I see folks like you, it... makes me hopeful that people will still be okay.	[]
Randy	2	0	Yeah... awesome...	[]
Old Cap	17	1	No, damn it!__No lining up behind the velvet rope!__God they just don't listen!_	['damn']
Jimmy	39	0	C-C-Cartman's army is getting bigger every day. In addition to the Federation and the kindergartners, the XBox army now also has the kids who play Harry Potter, the jocks, the swim team, and the glee club.	[]
Craig	18	0	Word is that the sixth graders all prefer XBox too, and will team up with Cartman as well.	[]
Stan	8	0	And who do we have on our side?	[]
Jimmy	11	0	Uh besides us, it's the book club and Janice Pinkerton.	[]
Stan	6	0	Did you ask the Vamp kids?	[]
Craig	4	0	They're still undecided.	[]
Stan	17	0	There has to be a way to get people on the fence to join our side._	[]
Boy	1	0	Playstation...	[]
Jimmy	11	0	Look, Sir Stan, it's probably time to give this up.	[]
Craig	15	0	We're just a dying breed, Stan. XBox is going to win this whole thing.	[]
Stan	33	0	So we're just gonna let other kids decide which game system we all play on? What would they do on Game of Thrones? What would they do when things look their darkest?	[]
Corporate Head	3	0	Huh? Isogashii yo!	[]
Member 1	13	0	Sorry to disturb you sir, but we thought you should see this._	[]
Corporate Head	15	0	Omae-ya kikei .__Jishu, taihen ne. __Winter is comingu. Choose side-o. Nani kore?_	[]
Member 1	13	0	Just a small down in Middle America, but apparently, a war is escalating.	[]
Member 2	28	0	Sir, if this were to become a news story, and if the first people inside their mall all got XBoxes... well it clearly looks bad for our image.	[]
Corporate Head	4	0	So desu ne..._	[]
Reporter 2	70	0	What's going to be the big item everyone goes for this Black Friday? It just might be the PlayStation 4. Sony has just announced they offering a special Black Friday bundle, called the Brack Friday Bunduru, which will include four controllers, a map of Japan, a hundred dollar rebate, and, allow you to automatically pre-order for Metal Gear Solid V. No doubt Sony has just raised the stakes.	[]
Cartman	36	0	Yes. Good, Federation kids. You're learning to fight with your hands! Keep pushing, kindergartners!__Sir Kyle, I know that Sony's offering a special Brack Friday Bunduru. You know the XBox is still better, right?	[]
Kyle	15	0	Yeah, but, why can't XBox automatically let you pre-order Metal Gear Solid V?	[]
Cartman	51	3	Sir Kyle, pre-order doesn't mean shit, okay? When you pre-order a game, you're just committing to paying for something that some assholes in California haven't even finished working on yet. You know what you get for pre-ordering a game? A big dick in your mouth.	['shit', 'assholes', 'dick']
Randy	37	0	Alright, listen up.__The mall is no longer allowing people to line up for Black Friday until Thanksgiving night.__It's okay. To hold places in line we're handing out wristbands.__Augh! Hold on! Oh God!	[]
Shopper 6	1	0	Wristbands!	[]
Old Cap	17	0	Back! Back, all of you!__If that's how you are, there'll_be_no wristbands! No go!_	[]
Shopper 7	1	0	Oh!	[]
Old Cap	3	0	Back away!_	[]
Shopper 4	11	1	I'm getting my son that Elmo doll, you fuck!_	['fuck']
Randy	2	0	No!_	[]
Old Cap	7	0	You did_good. The watch is yours now.	[]
Randy	9	0	No! You can't die! Everybody really likes you!	[]
Old Cap	10	0	This is what we signed up for. Right, my friend?	[]
Randy	21	0	No, I was lying to you! I took this job... to be at the front of the line on Black Friday.	[]
Old Cap	31	0	Heh. Now you know how serious this is. Whatever your intentions before, protect this town. You are in charge now. Take this.__Don't let... Black Friday... be the end._	[]
Randy	9	0	Get back inside. We have work to do._	[]
Stan	71	0	When we started this fight... it was because we were tired of XBox people telling us Playstation sucks! Now... we have an army of our own!__I can't guarantee you will live, but I can guarantee that before this is over... the winner of the console wars will be decided.__Our new leader has joined us to help make sure that system is the PS4!_All hail the Princess!_	[]
