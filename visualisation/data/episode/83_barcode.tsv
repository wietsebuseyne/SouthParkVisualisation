Russell Crowe	104	0	This is Tianinman Square. Lots of good foightin' has gone on here throughout the years, including a fan-tastic massacre that took place back in '93.  These chinamen can grow to over five feet tall, and in a fight, are known to kick with their legs. Let's see if we can get in for a closer look.  Oi!  I've gotten close enough now that they're startin' to get real froigh'ened. You can see the fine hairs on the back of their necks standin' on end.  Gotcha mate!  Ah, you wanna fight, huh?!
