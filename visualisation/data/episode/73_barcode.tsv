Kyle	4	0	HA! I killed you!	[]
Stan	6	0	HA, I blew your head off!	[]
Kenny	2	1	(Aw, Goddamnit!)	['goddamnit']
Stan	7	0	Jesus, is Cartman still in the bathroom?	[]
Kyle	15	0	Hey Cartman! We're almost to level 20! You giving birth in there, or what?	[]
Cartman	6	1	Let a man take a crap!	['crap']
Stan	8	0	Dude, he's in there punishing my toilet.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Hyeah, that poor, poor thing	[]
Stan	8	0	Come on, Cartman! You're missing the game!	[]
Cartman	41	2	I'm almost done, you smartasses! I'm just wipin' mah- whoa, what the hell is that?  You guys, look what I found in the trashcan in Stan's bathroom. It's like a bloody cotton thing wrapped in toilet paper.	['smartasses', 'hell']
Kyle	10	0	Well, why did you pull it out of the trash?	[]
Cartman	17	0	Because I thought it was a jelly doughnut, but look, check it out, it's all bloody.	[]
Sharon	8	0	Are you guys still playing that video game?	[]
Stan	12	0	Yeah. Hey Mom, Cartman found a bloody cotton thing in the bathroom.	[]
Cartman	18	0	Look.  But I don't think it's for usin', I think it's just for lookin' through.	[]
Sharon	4	0	Eric, put that down!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Why?	[]
Sharon	8	0	Just go put it back in the trashcan!	[]
Cartman	10	0	Hey, it's like all bloody. It might be alive.	[]
Sharon	10	0	No that... that came from me; just put it away.	[]
Cartman	25	0	This came out of you?? You just left it in the trashcan?!  You shouldn'ta done that. He's just a boih. Poor little feller.	[]
Stan	4	0	What is it, Mom?	[]
Kyle	6	0	Yeah, what it is, Mrs. Marsh?	[]
Sharon	39	0	Boys, that a... feminine thing. Alright, it's a personal, woman thing.  I tell you what: If you'll just drop the whole thing right now, I'll buy you that new video game console you've been wanting.	[]
Stan	4	0	The 2001 Okama GameSphere?	[]
Sharon	1	0	Sure.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Cool!	[]
Cartman	9	0	Wow, this is like finding trashcan gold, you guiys!	[]
Stan	6	0	There it is. The Okama GameSphere.	[]
Kyle	11	0	Dude, it's got a hundred twenty eight gigahertz D-RAM.	[]
Stan	3	0	What's that?	[]
Kyle	17	1	Don't know, but it kicks ass.  Wow, dude, you're the luckiest kid in South Park.	['ass']
Cartman	27	0	Hey, this is all of ours. I'm the one who found Stan's aborted brother in the trashcan and blackmailed his mom into getting the GameSphere.	[]
Stan	37	0	Alright, alright, but you guys gotta see if you can sleep over for the rest of the weekend.  It's Saturday at 2:30 - that means we have... 39 hours to play GameSphere until school on Monday!	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Woohoo!)	[]
Kyle	3	1	Awesome!  Oh, crap.	['crap']
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Kyle	20	0	I'm supposed to go to the lake with my family tomorrow and swim and play in the stupid sun.	[]
Stan	4	0	Dude, we got GameSphere.	[]
Kyle	26	0	I know, I know. Well, look: I'll stay over anyway so I can play for... eighteen hours, and then I'll go to the lake.	[]
Towelie	7	0	Don't forget to bring a towel.	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Towelie	31	0	When you get out of the water you need to dry off right away to avoid catchin' a cold. That's why Towelie says, Don't forget to bring a towel.	[]
Stan	2	0	...O-kay.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Thanks, Towelie.	[]
Towelie	5	0	Do you wanna get high?	[]
Stan	1	0	No.	[]
Kyle	11	0	Anyway, that will give me plenty of time playing video games.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Kyle, I think you underestimate Okama GameSphere.	[]
Sharon	4	0	Here you go, boys.	[]
Boys	1	0	AAAAAA.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Okay, turn it on.	[]
TV	2	0	Okama GameSphere!	[]
Boys	1	0	Whoa!	[]
TV	3	0	Thirst For BLOOD!	[]
Cartman	7	0	Oh yeah, Thirst for Blood. Bring it.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Oh, this is so cool.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Bring it, bring it!	[]
Sharon	8	0	Goodnight, boys. Don't stay up too late.	[]
Stan	6	0	G'night Mom, thanks for GameSphere.	[]
Cartman	13	0	Yeah, but you still shouldn'ta done that. 'E's just a boih.	[]
Randy	1	0	What?	[]
Sharon	4	0	Nothing. Come on, Randy.	[]
Kyle	33	0	Yeahyeah, Mom. I-I can't go to the lake. No, S-stan's having emotional problems and I need to help see him through it. He's got-  wha-what is it?	[]
Cartman	3	1	Date-rape psychosis.	['rape']
Kyle	17	1	Date-rape something. Yeah. Okay. I will. Okay, thanks, Mon.  I don't have to go outside!	['rape']
Cartman	1	0	Awesome!	[]
Kyle	16	0	She said it's fine, but that I still have to go to baseball practice tonight..	[]
Stan	9	1	Oh, yeah, we got baseball practice today. God damnit!	['damnit']
Cartman	10	0	We shouldn't have this many responsibilities! We're children!	[]
Stan	19	0	Well, it's alright. We can still play for  six more hours, and then we'll go play baseball.	[]
Towelie	7	0	Don't forget to bring a towel.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Uh no.	[]
Towelie	26	0	When you're playin' sports, the sweat can get in your face. That's why Towelie says, Always keep an extra towel in your duffel bag.	[]
Stan	3	0	Okay, we will.	[]
Towelie	6	0	Alright!  Do you wanna get high?	[]
Kyle	7	0	No we don't wanna get high!	[]
Towelie	3	0	Okay... You sure?	[]
Cartman	6	0	Yes! Go away, you stupid towel!	[]
Stan	14	0	Oh, dude! Did you see that? I cut off your face and ate it!	[]
Cartman	4	0	That's... so... cool!	[]
Sharon	10	0	Okay, boys, that's it. You have to go now.	[]
Stan	19	0	No no, it's okay, Mom. We c-we can't go to baseball practice 'cause Kyle has cancer.	[]
Sharon	12	0	No, Stanley, it's Monday morning. You have to go to school.	[]
Cartman	3	0	It's Monday?	[]
Stan	5	0	Oh, uh, I'm sick.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Me too.	[]
Sharon	12	0	No, you're not sick. Now get to school.  All of you.	[]
Stan	2	0	But Mom...	[]
Sharon	1	0	Go!	[]
Boys	1	0	Aagh!	[]
Stan	9	0	Can't believe we have to go to school!	[]
Kyle	8	0	Yeah, real life is so boring and stupid.	[]
Stan	21	0	We just have to try and make the day go as fast as possible so we can get back to GameSphere.	[]
Commander	5	0	Hello, boys, how are you?	[]
Stan	1	0	Fine.	[]
Commander	17	0	Say, boys, this may sound a little ...odd, but... have you see a ...talking ...towel around anywhere.	[]
Kyle	4	0	What? You mean Towelie?	[]
Commander	20	0	Echo, this is Garrett. I've got a code 5 at...  Park County, Colorado! Repeat! Code 5, Park County, Colorado!	[]
Cartman	2	0	What, dude?	[]
Stan	8	1	This is gonna be one looong-ass day.	['ass']
Stan	8	0	That was the longest day of school ever!	[]
Kyle	11	0	Come on, hurry. I bet we can get to level 29!	[]
Kyle	3	0	Where is it?	[]
Stan	5	0	It... it was right here.	[]
Kyle	5	1	Where the hell is it??	['hell']
Cartman	11	0	Come on, man, this isn't funny!  I need my fix!	[]
Stan	1	0	Hello?	[]
Voice	15	0	If you ever wanna see your Okama GameSphere again, you will bring us the towel.	[]
Stan	5	0	What? Who-who is this?	[]
Voice	16	0	Just get the towel and meet us at the gas station outside of town. Or else!	[]
Stan	4	0	Don't hurt it!	[]
Kyle	1	0	What?	[]
Stan	10	0	They've taken it. They've taken our Okama GameSphere.	[]
Cartman	2	0	No! ...No!	[]
Kyle	20	0	Uh-uh-uh what do you mean they've taken it? Oh, this isn't happening! This isn't happening!!	[]
Stan	1	0	Towelie!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Hey, towel!	[]
Kyle	5	1	Where the hell is he?	['hell']
Kenny	8	0	(I don't know. Where could it be?)	[]
Stan	19	0	I don't know. They guy on the phone thought we had Towelie, so now we gotta find him.	[]
Kyle	14	0	What has this world come to? Where people can just... take your Okama GameSphere.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Hey maybe we'd better do a towel call.  Gebaayybeh!  Gebaayybeh!	[]
Kyle	5	0	That's a towel call?	[]
Stan	9	0	This is hopeless. We're never gonna find him.	[]
Kyle	20	0	Hey, wait a minute. Towelie always showed up to give us towel advice when we'd said something about water.	[]
Stan	22	0	Hey yeah.  Well guys, let's go to the swimming pool!  Aaah. Let's go take a shower!  Let's go waterskiing!	[]
Towelie	7	0	Don't forget to bring a towel.	[]
Kyle	3	0	There he is!	[]
Towelie	13	0	Be sure to bring a towel so you don't get aaall wet. .	[]
Stan	3	0	Come on, dude!	[]
Towelie	4	0	Where are we goin'?	[]
Kyle	7	0	Just come on! It's getting dark.	[]
Towelie	5	0	Are we gonna get high?	[]
Kyle	10	0	Are you sure this is where they said to be?	[]
Stan	8	0	They said the gas station outside of town.	[]
Towelie	8	0	Well, I'm gonna get a little high.	[]
Man	2	0	Hold it!	[]
Stan	3	0	Who is that?	[]
Man	5	0	Step... away... from the towel!	[]
Official	12	0	There you are, towel. We've been looking all over for you.	[]
Towelie	14	0	If you ever go to a hotel, be sure to bring your own towel.	[]
Official	19	0	It isn't safe for you out here, towel. There are people out here to mean to harm you.	[]
Stan	15	0	'Scuse me, can we have our Okama GameSphere back? We just wanna play video games.	[]
Official	2	0	Your what?	[]
Kyle	16	0	Agh! Look, dude, we're on level 24, about to cross into the Caverns of Madness!	[]
Official	9	0	I don't know what you're talking about.	[]
Stan	18	0	You called us and said if we brought the towel you'd give us our video game back.	[]
Official	4	0	Omigod!  ITS A TRAP!!	[]
Man 2	2	0	Cover! Cover!	[]
Stan	3	1	Goddamnit, what now?!	['goddamnit']
Official	2	0	Run, towel!	[]
Stan	13	0	Agh. Come on, they've gotta have our video game around here somewhere.	[]
Soldier 1	4	0	Where's the towel?!	[]
Soldier 2	11	0	It can't be far!  Alvarez, you and Mitchell sweep left!	[]
Guard	9	0	Hurry! You must get the towel back to Tynacorp!	[]
Stan	5	0	Where is our Okama GameSphere?	[]
Guard	10	0	Get the towel home  They will explain everything. Please, hurry!	[]
Kyle	3	1	Aw, God-damnit!	['damnit']
Stan	9	0	Do you know where he's talking about, Towelie?	[]
Towelie	13	0	What? Oh yeah, back at the base. It's a long ways away.	[]
Stan	12	0	Alright, we're gonna have to use this truck. Come on, guys.	[]
Commander	1	0	Well?	[]
Soldier	14	0	They've gone, sir. It's like they've vanished out of thin air.	[]
Commander	17	1	Damnit! I knew those boys were protecting that towel.  They must have some unexplainable bond with it.	['damnit']
Soldier 2	12	0	Perhaps they're telepathically linked to the towel, sir, like E.T.	[]
Commander	21	0	It could already be anywhere, hiding out again. No, the time for being nice is over. We must instigate... Plan B.	[]
Soldier 3	2	0	You mean...?	[]
Commander	9	0	Yes.  Destroy all towels within a thousand mile radius.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Are we getting close?	[]
Towelie	3	0	I think so.	[]
Stan	5	0	A little more gas, Kenny.	[]
Kyle	11	0	How long has it been since you've been back there.	[]
Towelie	28	0	I've been wanderin' around on my own for the past few weeks. You know, helpin' people out with towel safety and proper towel use. It's important.	[]
Cartman	4	0	No it isn't.	[]
Towelie	1	0	Is!	[]
Cartman	4	0	No it isn't.	[]
Towelie	11	0	Is! Wait, turn down here. It's down this dirt road.	[]
Stan	3	0	Brake, Kenny, brake.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Egh!	[]
Towelie	8	0	M-maybe it's down that dirt road.	[]
Stan	8	0	Dude, don't you remember where it is?	[]
Towelie	22	0	I can't remember, it all looks the same. Hold on, let me get high.  then I'll remember where it is.	[]
Stan	5	0	Alright, so where is it?	[]
Towelie	3	0	Where's what?	[]
Boys	1	0	Agh!	[]
Kyle	12	0	The base where you're from and where our Okama GameSphere is!	[]
Stan	18	0	Alright, that does it! Brake angrily, Kenny!  Now listen, Towelie, we've just about had it with you!	[]
Towelie	3	0	Well calm down.	[]
Kyle	16	0	That's it!  You're not getting high again until we have our Okama GameSphere back!	[]
Towelie	6	1	That's my last joint, asshole!	['asshole']
Kyle	12	0	I don't care! You'd better remember where your base is!	[]
Towelie	10	1	Oh man, why is everyone riding me today? God-damnit.	['damnit']
Woman	16	0	Kevin? Don't forget to wrap the potato salad in aluminum foil.  Kevin, is that you?	[]
Soldier	5	0	Harris! Reach bang and clear!	[]
Woman	6	0	Hello?  WAAH!  Ohmigod! Oh no! Ohmigod!	[]
Soldier	7	0	Alright, it's clear! It's clear!	[]
Soldiers	1	0	HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!	[]
Soldier	6	0	Let's go let's go!	[]
Soldier	2	0	Get it!	[]
Mr. Garrison	2	0	What the?	[]
Soldier	3	0	Throw it down!	[]
Mr. Garrison	16	0	Oh alright, have your way with me if you must! Go on, fulfill you sick pleasures!	[]
Soldier	4	0	Alright, let's go!	[]
Mr. Garrison	5	0	Huh where are you goin'?	[]
Cartman	6	0	This is where you came from?	[]
Towelie	6	0	Yeah, I think so.  Oh man.	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Towelie	14	0	I'm so high right now. I have no idea what's goin' on.	[]
Research Leader	6	0	Welcome home, Smart Towel RG-400.	[]
Stan	9	0	Ah hi, is this where our Okama GameSphere is?	[]
Kyle	12	0	We're missing out on some quality video game time right now.	[]
Research Leader	32	0	Thank you for bringing him to us, boys. You see, this is not an ordinary towel. He is the RG-400 Smart Towel, designed with a computer chip inside the terry cloth	[]
Stan	4	0	We don't care.	[]
Research Leader	31	0	You see, here at Tynacorp, our goal was to make the perfect towel. A towel that would sense how wet or dry the user's skin was and fluff itself accordingly.	[]
Stan	5	0	Dude, we don't care.	[]
Research Leader	37	0	Towelie was our greatest success. Smart enough to beat the average human at chess and absorbent enough to soak up even the toughest spills. But then one day, Towelie got high and just sort of wandered off.	[]
Stan	4	0	We... don't... care.	[]
Kyle	10	0	All we wanna know is, who has our Okama GameSphere?	[]
Research Leader	49	0	Ah yes, your video game. I'm afraid that what we all experienced was a trap. They called you and said to bring the towel, and then they called us and said they were bringing Towelie back. Their plan was to wipe us all out with one fell swoop.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Who's they?	[]
Research Leader	32	0	Why, the military. You see, after Towelie got high and wandered off from here, the military got a hold of him. They wanted to turn Towelie into a weapon of mass destruction.	[]
Stan	9	0	Don't care, don't care, don't care.	[]
Research Leader	28	0	Towelie was at their base for months as they tried to copy his TNA. But then, one day, Towelie got high and just sort of wandered off. Again.	[]
Cartman	13	1	Goddamnit! Can we please... just get back to playing our video game, PLEASE?!	['goddamnit']
Research Leader	12	0	I'm afraid not. Because your Okama GameSphere is at their base.	[]
Stan	8	0	Can you tell us where that is, please?	[]
Research Leader	33	0	You mean to go right into their base?  Of course. The entry code should still be in Towelie's memory banks. You could sneak him in there and recover his TNA. Great plan.	[]
Soldier	8	0	Sir! Sergeant Masters and Boll are reporting, sir!	[]
Commander	11	0	Ah yes.  Tell me, Marine, did you accomplish your primary goal?	[]
Sgt. Masters	15	0	Sir yes sir! All towels have been destroyed! The Smart Towel is no doubt eliminated.	[]
Commander	8	0	Ahh. And you're... quite sure of this.	[]
Sgt. Boll	13	0	Eh yes sir, there isn't a towel left within a hundred miles.	[]
Commander	20	0	Hmm...  So perhaps, then, you can explain to me why we just got footage of the towel returning to Tynacorp?!	[]
Sgt. Masters	2	0	Oo we...	[]
Sgt. Boll	6	0	He must have outsmarted us, sir.	[]
Commander	21	0	Well I'm through playing hide and seek! We've got no other choice! Prepare to blow up all of Colorado!	[]
Research Leader	27	0	In a moment we will be over the base. This is the only way in. Any attempts on the ground would be easily spotted by guard posts.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Okay.	[]
Research Leader	20	0	I hate to send you back in there, Towelie, but only you have their security system in your memory banks.	[]
Towelie	11	0	That's alright. It's always good to bring a towel.	[]
Research Leader	12	0	Good luck, boys. The fate of the world is depending on you.	[]
Stan	20	0	We're not doing it for the world, we're doing it for our video game. God, are you deaf?	[]
Guard	13	0	Alright, boys. When you drop from the plane, cover and roll. Got it?	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Guard	4	0	Go go go go!	[]
Kyle	5	0	Dude, I figured it out.	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Kyle	25	0	If we can go in, and get the GameSphere in 30 minutes, we could still be back at your house playing video games by midnight!	[]
Stan	13	0	So that'd be, like what, eight hours we could play before school?	[]
Kyle	4	0	Seven and a half.	[]
Stan	4	0	Hurry up, stupid parachute!	[]
Cartman	7	0	Alright, I think we go over there.	[]
Towelie	4	0	Let's see.  No.	[]
Stan	15	0	Come on, Towelie! The guy said you have the security system in your memory banks.	[]
Towelie	7	0	Hey it's been a long time!	[]
Cartman	14	0	You just have no long-term memory 'cause you get high all the time!	[]
Towelie	6	1	Don't preach to me, fatso!	['fatso']
Cartman	12	0	I can preach to you all I want, 'cause you're stupid!	[]
Towelie	3	0	You're stupid!	[]
Cartman	6	0	Yeah, and you're a towel!	[]
Towelie	18	0	You're a towel!  Just let me get high. I know I can remember if I get high.	[]
Stan	10	1	Oh, God damnit! Alright, fine!  Here's your stupid lighter.	['damnit']
Towelie	8	0	Hold on.  Wait a second  That's it!	[]
Kyle	3	0	That's it?	[]
Towelie	17	0	Yeah. That's the melody to Funky Town.  Won't ya take me down... to Funky Town.	[]
Stan	5	0	No, Towelie, the entry code!	[]
Towelie	2	0	For what?	[]
Stan	13	1	God-damnit, I guess we're gonna have to climb the stupid fence.	['damnit']
Kyle	6	0	Well let's look in here.	[]
Towelie Clone	4	0	Kill... me... Kill... me.	[]
Towelie	7	0	Oh my God! No-o-o-o!	[]
Commander	9	0	Well well well. Look what the cat dragged in.	[]
Towelie	4	0	What are these things?	[]
Commander	18	0	Genetic copies we tried to make with your TNA. They didn't work too well, I'm afraid.	[]
Towelie Clone	2	0	Kill... me.	[]
Stan	6	0	Do you have our Okama GameSphere?	[]
Commander	42	0	You did very well to get the towel this far, boys. I wonder: What did they tell you at Tynacorp? That the big, bad government wanted to genetically engineer a Towelie as a weapon? Now let me tell you the real story.	[]
Stan	8	0	Oh God, don't care, don't care.	[]
Commander	34	0	Yes, we've been trying to make our own genetic copies of the towel, but only because we had to. You see, when we started spying on Tynacorp, we discovered a certain, terrifying secret.	[]
Soldier	7	0	Go on! Ask him what terrifying secret.	[]
Kyle	3	0	What terrifying secret?	[]
Commander	11	0	That Tynacorp was making these towels to take over the world!	[]
Cartman	11	0	We're never gonna play our Okama GameSphere again, are we?	[]
Commander	74	0	Don't you see what genetically enhanced smart towels like these are capable of? You get out of the shower and dry yourself off. But even after you're dry, the towel makes you more dry. It keeps getting you drier and drier.  Can you imagine it? What it would feel like to be way, way too dry? I'll tell you something: You don't want to know. And I don't know.	[]
Kyle	5	0	And we don't care.	[]
Commander	22	0	You've been double-crossed by Tynacorp, kids. They set this all up to get you in here and take us down.	[]
Stan	13	0	So let me get this straight: Our Okama GameSphere is back at Tynacorp.	[]
Commander	7	0	Oh yes. It has been all along.	[]
Soldier	7	0	Can I kill the towel now, sir?	[]
Kyle	2	0	Go ahead.	[]
Commander	55	0	No, wait.  Perhaps now, we can use their own towel against them. These boys must return to Tynacorp, and we will launch a sneak attack on Tynacorp as well.  You boys can take the towel to Tynacorp's central core, and upload this encryption disk into their system, bringing them down once and for all.	[]
Stan	5	0	But we don't care!	[]
Official 1	21	1	What the hell is this?! The towel was supposed to go in there and then run its own self-destruct sequence!	['hell']
Research Leader	12	0	The towel has a will of its own. It's... learning compassion.	[]
Official 2	21	0	We don't have the manpower to hold off the entire military AND stop those wonderboys from getting to the core!	[]
Research Leader	16	0	Then we have no choice. We'll have to test the new prototype a little... earlier.	[]
GS-401	7	0	Don't forget to bring a towel!	[]
Commander	22	0	Alright, boys, take the towel back in there and say your mission was accomplished.  Then upload this encryption disk into their computers.	[]
Stan	11	0	We're just going in to get our video game back.	[]
Commander	10	0	If anything goes wrong, use this newly-developed photon rifle.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Photon rifle, whatever.	[]
Stan	4	0	Hello? Hello, anybody here?	[]
GS-401	6	0	Welcome to the party, boys!  HAAARRRHHHH!!	[]
Towelie	4	0	Oooh. Ooohh! Oh boy.	[]
GS-401	1	0	HAAARRRHHHH!!	[]
Research Leader	10	0	So, you thought you could outsmart us, did you kids?	[]
Commander	14	1	Aaaaarrrr. Move move move move move move!  Don't make a move, you bastards!	['bastards']
Research Leader	10	0	Bring the towel here, boys. They can't shoot children.	[]
Commander	10	0	Don't listen to them. They lied to you before.	[]
Research Leader	19	0	Oh yes, boys. Obey your government! Well perhaps it's time these boys knew what was really gong on!	[]
Stan	2	0	Ohmigod, look!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Our GameSphere!	[]
Stan	7	0	Aw, sweet, it still saved our plays.	[]
Research Leader	31	0	You see boys, I'm afraid you were double-crossed. If they were the military, why wouldn't they just attack us to begin with? Because they're not the military!	[]
Commander	28	0	Alright, maybe we lied to you, but it was to protect your own skin! We are a resistance group pretending to be the military to bring Tynacorp down!	[]
Cartman	8	0	Whoa, check it out, guys, the parachute level.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Sweet!	[]
Commander	25	0	But perhaps we should show these kids who Tynacorp really is made up of. Go on! Tell them why you've been making towels! Zytar!	[]
