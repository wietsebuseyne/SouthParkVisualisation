Kyle	10	0	Oh dude, check it out. I got a Jake Plummer.	[]
Cartman	9	1	Aw man, I got a crappy AJ Feeley again!	['crappy']
Kyle	9	0	How come you didn't buy any cards, Stan?	[]
Stan	15	0	I can't spend any money. I'm saving up for that bike I want.	[]
Cartman	4	0	HA! Saving money, duhhh!	[]
Kyle	19	0	So what should we do now? It's Saturday and we have to have as much fun as possible.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Hey, I know! Let's go play laser tag at FunPlex.	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Hey yeah!)	[]
Stan	19	0	No, I don't wanna spend any money, you guys.  Let's just do something fun that's free.	[]
Cartman	19	0	Stan, don't you know the first law of physics? Anything that's fun costs at least eight dollars.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Yeah dude, nothing fun is free.	[]
Stan	7	0	Well I can't spend any money.	[]
Cartman	11	1	Okay, be a Jew. We're gonna go play laser tag.	['jew']
Kyle	3	0	Yeah. See ya.	[]
Woman	16	0	Hello, would you like to take a personality test? It's fun and it's free.	[]
Stan	2	0	Excuse me?	[]
Woman	7	0	We're doing free personality tests today.	[]
Stan	7	0	Uh what do I have to do?	[]
Woman	62	0	Have you heard of Scientology? It's all based on the book, Dianetics. A lot of really cool people are Scientologist's, like Tom Cruise and John Travolta. Why don't you come on in and we'll get your fun free personality test started.  Let's just find an empty room here, lots of people getting free tests today.  Hey Brian.	[]
Brian	6	0	Hey Kelly. How's it going?	[]
Kelly	10	0	Great! I want you to meet my new friend, Stan.	[]
Brian	5	0	Hey there! How are you?	[]
Stan	1	0	Fine.	[]
Kelly	17	0	Brian's gonna give you your personality test and then let you know some things about Scientology.	[]
Brian	4	0	Good times, good times!	[]
Stan	14	0	L-look, is this a religion? Because my family is like, Catholic or something.	[]
Brian	19	1	Ho, that's not a problem at all. Scientology is more like an alternative to psychology than a religion.	['ho']
Stan	9	0	Then how come that sign says Church of Scientology?	[]
Brian	16	0	Oho, that's just this thing: What's the Denver Broncos' record now? Six and two?	[]
Stan	3	0	Seven and two.	[]
Brian	53	0	Wow! That's great! All right, come on in and take a seat; we're gonna have some fun!  All right now, I'm just gonna ask you a few questions. Just answer these questions as truthfully as you can, alright?  Okay. Number 1: Do you ever make remarks... which you later regret?	[]
Stan	3	0	Uhhh, sh-sure?	[]
Brian	10	0	Uh huh. Would you rather give orders... than take them?	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah?	[]
Brian	22	0	Do you ever whistle... just for the fun of it.  Okay, and finally, does life sometimes feel vague and confusing to you?	[]
Stan	1	0	Yes.	[]
Brian	14	0	Okay, Stan. Well, that's it. That's the end of the personality test.	[]
Stan	5	0	So how did I do?	[]
Brian	15	0	Well, I hate to tell you this, Stan, but... you are one messed-up kid.	[]
Stan	1	0	...Huh??	[]
Brian	12	0	Yeah, I'm afraid that you are completely miserable and totally depressed.	[]
Stan	7	0	I am?? I didn't know that!	[]
Brian	23	0	Well there's certainly no question that you are a perfect candidate for Scientology. I think it can really make you happy again.	[]
Stan	5	0	What what do I do?	[]
Brian	12	0	It's very simple. We just need two hundred and forty dollars.	[]
Sharon	13	0	Stanley, you haven't touched your food. What's the matter with you?	[]
Stan	4	0	I'm totally depressed.	[]
Sharon	2	0	What? Why?	[]
Stan	4	0	I don't know.	[]
Sharon	9	0	Well how long have you been feeling this way?	[]
Stan	12	0	I'm not sure. But... I need two hundred and forty dollars.	[]
Randy	11	0	Two hundred and forty dollars?! What'd you do, break something?!	[]
Stan	11	0	No, I found a self-help program that can cure me.	[]
Randy	7	0	Oh Jesus, the answer is no, Stanley.	[]
Stan	10	0	But I'm completely miserable and these people can help!	[]
Sharon	8	0	Stanley, I didn't know you were miserable.	[]
Stan	3	0	Neither did I!	[]
Randy	18	0	Stanley, do you have any concept of money at all? Money doesn't grow on trees, you know?	[]
Stan	20	0	Don't you care that I'm depressed?! What if I become suicidal, or, or become an alcoholic like Grandpa??	[]
Grandpa	1	0	Huh?	[]
Randy	24	0	Well, if you really think your life is so bad, Stan, why don't you take what you have out of your bicycle savings?!	[]
Stan	7	0	...well but... but that's my money.	[]
Randy	29	0	Yeah, well just like the rest of us, you have to make choices with your money. Do you want a bike, or do you not want to be depressed?	[]
Kelly	8	0	Michelle, our friend Stan wants to have auditing.	[]
Michelle	9	0	Oho good, you're going to be so happy.	[]
Stan	3	0	I hope so.	[]
Kelly	15	0	It's the beginning of a whole new life for you, Stan. See ya afterwards.	[]
Michelle	62	0	Great, so do you have the two hundred and forty dollars.  Perfect! We're on our way!  Come on over here and I'll fill you in on how the Church of Scientology works.  You see, Stan, Scientology was founded by a great man named L. Ron Hubbard.  Mr. Hubbard discovered that negative emotions are actually caused by things called body thetans.	[]
Stan	1	0	Really?	[]
Michelle	67	0	Yes! And being the genius that he was, Mr. Hubbard invented a way to get rid of those bad thetans.  This is called an E-meter. It's the main tool of Scientology. You just grab a hold of these handles as I talk you through past experiences in your life. I'll be taking readings here, and we'll be able to determine your thetan levels.	[]
Stan	2	0	Thetan levels...	[]
Michelle	50	0	Come on in the auditing room and I'll show you how it works.  All these people are just like you, Stan, auditing with E-meters to get rid of their negative emotions.  All right, Stan, I want you to just relax and take hold of the E-meter handles.	[]
Stan	7	0	So, this is gonna make me happy?	[]
Michelle	24	0	Just take a few deep breaths, and I'll just get a base reading of your thetan levels.  Huh, that's, that's strange.	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Michelle	12	0	Somethin-,  something's wrong. Brian, could you come over here a second?	[]
Brian	5	0	Yep- Oh hey there, Greg!	[]
Stan	1	0	Stan.	[]
Michelle	7	0	Will you... look at his thetan levels?	[]
Brian	17	0	Huh, well. We'll get another E-meter - this one's obviously broken. Sorry about this, Greg.	[]
Recruiter	29	0	And so we just try to analyze your personality, and if it seems like you need some help, then you can have an audit counseling for a nominal fee.	[]
Mr. Mackey	7	0	Well, that sounds pretty reasonable, m'kay.	[]
Brian	7	0	Mike, I need to talk to you!	[]
Mike	15	0	Excuse me, sir, I'll be right back.  Are you all right? You're sweating!	[]
Brian	5	0	Take a look at this.	[]
Mike	3	0	What is it?	[]
Brian	11	0	The E-meter results from the little boy in Room D	[]
Mike	6	0	This... this can't be right.	[]
Brian	12	0	We ran the tests four times! We used four different E-meters!	[]
Mike	20	0	Fax these results to the head office in Los Angeles. The President has to see thus right away. Go!  Now!	[]
Woman	11	0	The boy is from a small mountain town in Colorado, sir.	[]
Man	32	0	Sir, how can it be that a first timer scores that kind of thetan level?? He registered OT9! I'm only OT7 and I've been in the church all my life!	[]
President	9	0	I've waited... forty-two years... for this day.	[]
Man	1	0	Sir?	[]
President	46	0	Don't you all see what this means? There was only one person who EVER registered OT9 in the history of our church.  L. Ron Hubbard said he had lived past lives. That when he died his thetan would show itself again. Our prophet has returned.	[]
Sharon	11	0	Uh, Stanley, take the garbage out before you go to bed.	[]
Stan	6	0	I took out the garbage yesterday.	[]
Randy	3	0	Right now, Stan!	[]
Stan	4	0	Aagh!  Stupid dumb garbage!	[]
Man 2	3	0	There he is!	[]
Man 3	4	0	Thank you for returning!	[]
Man 4	6	0	He's wonderful.  He's wonderful.	[]
Randy	7	1	Stan! What the hell did you do?!	['hell']
Stan	4	0	I don't know!	[]
President	17	0	Hello young man. I'm the head of Scientology. It is...  a great honor to meet you!	[]
Randy	9	1	All right, what the hell is going on here?!	['hell']
President	24	0	We've been looking for your son for a long time, Mr. Marsh. He is the reincarnation of our church's most famous prophet.	[]
Sharon	1	0	Wwhat??	[]
President	12	0	Scientologist's the world over are simply rejoicing at his second coming.	[]
Randy	12	0	Look, we don't want our son to join your group, okay?	[]
President	15	0	We're not asking him to join us, we're asking him... to lead us.	[]
Shelly	7	0	Oh my God, it's John Travolta!	[]
John Travolta	15	0	Is this where he lives? Is this where L. Ron Hubbard is? Oh my god!	[]
President	42	0	Yes, John Travolta and Tom Cruise are big Scientologist's. Do you believe me nooow?  Young man, I know you don't remember it,but... your name was L. Ron Hubbard. You revealed the secret that began the whole Church of Scientology.	[]
Randy	21	0	Okay, Stan, it's late, go up to your room and get ready for bed! Let Mommy and Daddy handle this.	[]
Stan	2	0	Jesus Christ...	[]
Cruise	17	0	L. Ron?  L. Ron! It really is you!  Oh, this is the greatest day of my life!	[]
Stan	8	0	Aw dude, I need to go to bed.	[]
Cruise	11	0	Don't you understand, L. Ron? It's me! Tom Cruise!	[]
Stan	6	0	Yeah, I know who you are.	[]
Cruise	20	0	Ha-haven't I done well, L. Ron? Haven't you enjoyed my acting? Which film did you like best?	[]
Stan	22	0	Well-h. I mean, you're not... you're not like as good as Leonardo DiCaprio, but you're okay, I guess.	[]
Cruise	1	0	...What?	[]
Stan	18	0	I mean, you're not Gene Hackman or that guy who played Napoleon Dynamite, but you're okay.	[]
Cruise	14	0	I'm nothing.  I'm a failure in the eyes of the Prophet! AAAH!	[]
Stan	10	0	Hey!  Dude, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.	[]
Cruise	2	0	Go away!	[]
Stan	5	0	Dude, this is my room!	[]
Cruise	4	0	Go away, I said!	[]
Stan	10	0	Dad! Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet!	[]
Cruise	1	0	What?!	[]
Stan	13	0	Tom Cruise locked himself in my closet and he won't come out.	[]
Randy	9	0	Mr. Cruise? Mr. Cruise, come out of the closet.	[]
Cruise	1	0	No!	[]
Randy	7	0	Come on, Mr. Cruise, this is ridiculous.	[]
Cruise	5	0	I'm never coming out!	[]
Randy	6	0	What did you say to him?	[]
Stan	17	0	I just told him I thought the Napoleon Dynamite guy is a better actor than he is.	[]
Randy	18	0	Oh boy.  Mr. Cruise, you can't just stay in the closet, alright? You need to come out.	[]
Sharon	4	0	What's going on?	[]
Randy	9	0	Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet.	[]
Sharon	1	0	What??	[]
Cruise	4	0	Just leave me alone!	[]
Randy	16	0	Well, we CAN'T leave you alone because YOU won't come out of the closet!	[]
Field Reporter	33	0	It's been four hours now, and Tom Cruise still will not come out of the closet. Hundreds of onlookers here have gathered here in hopes that the celebrity will finally give in.	[]
Sergeant	42	0	Tom Cruise, this is Park County police! Please come out of the closet.  Everybody here just wants you to come out of the closet, Tom.  Nobody's gonna be mad, everything's gonna be all right. Just come out of the closet.	[]
Field Reporter	25	0	We're still not exactly sure why Tom Cruise is in the closet, but I'm being joined now by famous singer/songwriter R. Kelly.	[]
R. Kelly	37	0	Well I was just standing here, and Tom Cruise locked himself in the closetI asked myself why won't Tom Cruise just come out the closet?Nobody has no answers, and so I pull out my gun!	[]
President	26	0	Please, understand, we just want what is best for your son. The reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard must be taken care of. He had many enemies.	[]
Randy	9	0	Wasn't L. Ron Hubbard a science-fiction writer?	[]
President	17	0	Yes. But he was also a prophet... who knew the secret truth about the nature of life.	[]
Sharon	5	0	This is just too much.	[]
President	26	0	We want to reveal to Stan the great secret of life behind our church. The safely-guarded Scientology doctrine. Please, your son deserves to be enlightened.	[]
Randy	14	0	Stan, do you want to hear the great secret doctrine of life behind Scientology?	[]
Stan	1	0	Sure.	[]
Randy	7	0	All right, go ahead and tell him.	[]
President	11	0	Would you excuse us, please? This is highly-classified church information.	[]
Randy	2	0	Aw rats.	[]
President	24	0	Usually, to hear the secret doctrine, you have to be in the church for several years, Stan.  Are you ready to hear the truth?	[]
Stan	3	0	I, I guess.	[]
President	41	0	You see, Stan, there is a reason for people feeling sad and depressed.  An alien reason. It all began 75 million years ago. Back then there was a galactinc federation of planets which was ruled over by the evil Lord Xenu.	[]
Xenu	6	6	Ho ho ho ho ho ho.	['ho', 'ho', 'ho', 'ho', 'ho', 'ho']
President	23	0	Xenu thought his galaxy was overpopulated,  and so he rounded up countless aliens from all different planets,  and then had those aliens frozen.	[]
Xenu	4	0	Wa ha ha ha!	[]
President	74	0	The frozen alien bodies were loaded onto Xenu's galactic cruisers, which looked like DC-8s, except with rocket engines. The cruisers then took the frozen alien bodies to our planet, to Earth, and dumped them into the volcanoes of Hawaii.  The aliens were no longer frozen, they were dead. The souls of those aliens, however, lived on, and all floated up towards the sky. But the evil Lord Xenu had prepared for this.	[]
Xenu	4	0	Wa ha ha ha!	[]
President	134	0	Xenu didn't want their souls to return! And so he built giant soul-catchers in the sky!  The souls were taken to a huge soul brain-washing facility, which Xenu had ALSO built on Earth.  There the souls were forced to watch days of brainwashing material  which tricked them into believing a false reality. Xenu then released the alien souls, which roamed the earth aimlessly in a fog of confusion. At the dawn of man, the souls finally found bodies which they can grab onto. They attached themselves to all mankind, which still to this day causes all our fears, our confusions, and our problems.  L. Ron Hubbard did an amazing thing telling the world this incredible truth. Now all we're asking you to do...  is pick up where he left off.	[]
Stan	9	0	But I don't know any of this stuff.	[]
President	30	0	Neither did L. Ron when he started. He said he just closed his eyes, and wrote down whatever came to mind. You can do the same. Just let it flow.	[]
Stan	23	0	Okay, I'll try. I just wish I could write in my room, but Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet.	[]
President	15	0	I know. We've sent Nicole Kidman up there to see if she can help.	[]
Nicole	5	0	Tom? Tom, It's Nicole.	[]
Cruise	3	0	Ah hi Nicole.	[]
Nicole	22	0	Tom, don't you think this has gone on long enough? It's time for you to come out of the closet.	[]
Cruise	9	0	...I'm not, I'm not in the closet.	[]
Nicole	43	0	Yes you are, Tom. And you need to just end this and come out.  I'm not gonna think any differently of you. Katie's not gonna think any differently of you. You don't need to be in that closet anymore, Tom.	[]
Cruise	6	0	I'm not in here, though.	[]
Nicole	3	0	Yes, you are.	[]
Cruise	9	0	I'm not, ...I'm not in the closet.	[]
Nicole	38	0	Then how am I talking to you, Tom?  Tom, you can't hide forever just because the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard doesn't like your acting. Come out of the closet, Tom. You're not fooling anyone.	[]
Cruise	10	0	I'm, I'm not, I'm not in here.	[]
Stan	2	0	Yeah, yeah!	[]
Kyle	9	0	Hey Stan, we're gonna go to the movies.	[]
Stan	13	0	I can't. I'm writing a new sacred doctrine for my church.	[]
Kyle	15	0	Look, Stan, we're really getting concerned about this cult that you're getting into.	[]
Stan	19	0	Cult? Scientology isn't a cult, Kyle. I've read all this stuff and it's based on fact.	[]
Kyle	26	0	Dude, L. Ron Hubbard was a science-fiction writer. He lived on a boat with only young boys and got busted by the feds numerous times.	[]
Stan	21	0	I did not! Those are rumors put out by people who are afraid because they don't know the secret truth.	[]
Kyle	3	0	What secret truth??	[]
Stan	29	0	I can't tell you unless you pay for a few years of audit counseling! All I know is that I was depressed before, and now I found meaning!	[]
Kyle	7	0	I didn't know you were depressed.	[]
Stan	25	0	Neither did I! But now, if you guys can't accept this great thing I belong to, then I suppose we're no longer friends!	[]
Cartman	15	0	Stan, I just want you to know that I still hate Kyle more than you.	[]
Travolta	7	0	Tom! Hey Tom, this is John Travolta.	[]
Cruise	3	0	Oh hey John.	[]
Travolta	12	0	Tom, you've gotta come out of the closet. Oh my God.	[]
Cruise	11	0	L. Ron Hubbard doesn't think I'm a great actor.	[]
Travolta	29	0	Mm-maybe you took what he said out of context. Okay, 's like, if you don't come out, can I at least come in and talk to you?	[]
Cruise	5	0	Oh... Okay, but no tricks.	[]
Travolta	9	0	No tricks.  Hey, it's really nice n here.	[]
Cruise	2	0	Yeah, see?	[]
Travolta	7	0	I feel really safe. Oh my god.	[]
Randy	6	0	Hello?  Hey, come out of there!	[]
Field Reporter	27	0	Tom, it now appears that John Travolta is also in the closet, and he refuses to come out. Here with more details once again, is R. Kelly.	[]
R. Kelly	45	0	I was just standing here. Tom Cruise locked himself in the closetThen John Travolta come and now, John Travolta in the closet too.Please Tom Cruise and John Travolta come out the closet!But then I calm myself down, and I pull out my gun!	[]
Field Reporter	9	0	Oh geez, here we go with the gun again.	[]
President	7	0	Yes... Yes, oh this is great, Stan!	[]
Stan	23	0	I wrote that um, our followers shouldn't fly in DC-8s anymore because they're too much like Xenu's evil cruisers.	[]
President	5	0	Yes, of course! So wonderful!	[]
Stan	15	0	And I wrote that the evil Lord Xenu was recently broken out of galactic jail.	[]
President	3	0	Yes, of course!	[]
Stan	20	0	And best of all, I wrote that all the Scientologist's should no longer have to pay money to belong.	[]
President	1	0	What?	[]
Stan	16	0	I I realize that to really be a church, we can't charge people for help.	[]
President	13	0	What are you, stupid?! Then how do we make money from those people?!	[]
Stan	13	0	... Well, it's not about the money, it's about the message, right?	[]
President	44	2	Wait a minute, whoa, whoa! You don't actually believe this crap, do you?? Dummy! Brainwashed alien souls?? E-meters and thetan levels?? Those people out there buy that crap and I thought YOU were smart enough to see what was really going on!	['crap', 'crap']
Stan	6	0	But you said that there were-	[]
President	21	0	What's better than telling people a stupid story and having them believe you?!  Having them PAY you for it, stupid!	[]
Stan	14	0	But then, why me? Why do you need me to write something so badly?	[]
President	32	0	Because if those people all think you're the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard, then they'll all buy your new writings, and you and I together will make three million dollars!	[]
Stan	3	0	Three million dollars?	[]
President	21	1	That's how the scam works! But this is a scam on a global scale! Do you fucking get me now?!	['fucking']
Stan	5	0	Yeah. Yeah, I get you.	[]
President	9	0	Then keep writing, L. Ron! Your people are waiting.	[]
Field Reporter	29	0	Breaking news here in South Park. Tom Cruise and John Travolta still... will not come out of the closet. Park County police have decided to try a new method.	[]
R. Kelly	33	1	I've been asked to come up here, get you both out of the closetMan, this is some crazy shit. Why won't you both just come out the closet?And they said...	['shit']
"Cruise, Travolta"	13	0	We're not comin' out the closet, so you can just go away.	[]
R. Kelly	7	0	But everyone wants you out the closet.	[]
"Cruise, Travolta"	9	0	That doesn't matter 'cause we're gonna stay.	[]
R. Kelly	13	0	Now I'm startin' to get angry, so I pull out my gun!	[]
President	37	0	My fellow Scientologist's! Our prophet has finished his new doctrine, and will now read some passages before making it available to you all for a nominal fee.  I give you... the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard!	[]
Stan	21	0	Uh, thanks. So, first of all, I've written that the brainwashed alien ghosts are actually from a galaxy called Nubanon.	[]
Crowd	1	0	Ohhhh.	[]
Man	1	0	Nubanon.	[]
Stan	9	0	And uh, oh,  ...I ...I can't do this.	[]
President	2	0	Huh, what?	[]
Stan	39	0	Look, everybody, we're all looking for answer, you know. We all want to understand who we are and where we come from, but... sometimes we want to know the answers so badly that we... believe just about anything.	[]
Man 2	1	0	Huh?	[]
Woman	1	0	What?	[]
Stan	18	1	I'm not the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard. And... Scientology is just a big fat global scam.	['fat']
Brian	6	0	Oh! We are gonna sue you!	[]
Stan	1	0	What??	[]
President	16	0	Yeah, you think you can say our religion is a lie?! We'll sue you, buddy!	[]
Stan	7	0	YOU told me it was a lie!	[]
President	13	1	Ho, now you're puttin' words in MY mouth! You are so sued!	['ho']
Man 3	17	2	You can't make fun of Scientology, kid! We are gonna sue your ass AND your balls!	['ass', 'balls']
Crowd	4	0	Yeah, that's right!	[]
President	17	0	How dare you mock our faith, you little punk?! You'll be hearing from our lawyers tomorrow!	[]
Field Reporter	23	0	We've just had an incredible development here, Mitch. Tom Cruise, John Travolta, and R. Kelly, have all come out of the closet!	[]
Cruise	18	0	So you're NOT the prophet, huh?! You made me look stupid! I'm gonna sue you too!	[]
Stan	7	0	Well fine! Go ahead and sue me!	[]
Cruise	8	0	I will! I'll sue you in England!	[]
President	5	0	You are so sued, kid!	[]
Stan	6	0	Well go on, then! Sue me!	[]
President	4	0	We're going to!	[]
Stan	12	0	Okay, good! Do it! I'm not scared of you! Sue me!	[]
