Elephant Man	105	3	A lot of decent hard-working freaks in America are losing their talk-show jobs to freaks of a different nature. Sure, everyone in this great country of hours is a freak, but true, physically deformed freaks must be recognized, for it's these real freaks that make you all feel better about yourselves for not being one. So next time you're watching television, make sure it's a show with freak freaks, and not just with people that are freaks because they're stupid trailer trash from the South. That's what we mean when we say, Look for the True Freak label	['freak', 'freak', 'freak']
