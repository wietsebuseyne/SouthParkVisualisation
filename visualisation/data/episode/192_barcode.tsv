News Anchor	66	0	Several whales and dolphins were again slaughtered by the Japanese today, this time at the Six Flags Discovery Kingdom near San Francisco.  Aquariums had been experimenting with methods to keep the Japanese out, but so far nothing seems to stop them. When asked if all of Japan supported the slaughtering of whales and dolphins, the current Prime Minister of Japan, Yukio Hatoyama, had this to say	[]

Stan	14	0	No, not the song. I'm talking about the Japanese killing whales and dolphins.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Dude, they've been doing that for a long time.	[]
Stan	12	0	So? Dude, don't you guys care? We have to do something?	[]
Kyle	34	0	What are we gonna do, Stan? It's, it's not like we can change the way an entire country thinks. I don't like it, but it's just the way they are.	[]
Stan	36	0	It seems like everyone has an attitude of that's just the way they are or that's just the way it is! Nobody likes it, but everybody's too busy to do anything about it!	[]
Cartman	6	0	I'm not too busy, Stan.	[]
Stan	3	0	You're not?	[]
Cartman	8	0	No, I just don't care. At all.	[]
Kenny	3	0	(Yeah, me neither.)	[]
Stan	11	0	Kenny? You don't care about whales and dolphins being slaughtered?	[]
Cartman	13	2	Stan, me and Kenny don't give two shits about stupid-ass whaaales!	['shits', 'ass']
Stan	34	1	You know, when all the whales and dolphins in the world are gone, people are gonna wish that at some point they had taken a little time to care just a little goddamn bit!	['goddamn']
Cartman	25	1	I wanna roll with him a hard pair we will be. I don't give a crap 'bout whales so go and hug a tree.	['crap']
Butters	16	0	Hey Stan! I heard you were looking for people who care about the Japanese slaughterin' whales.	[]
Stan	6	0	Yeah. Butters, do you wanna help?	[]
Butters	33	0	Nononono, I got stuff to do. But I wanted to tell you there's these fellers on TV. They go out in the ocean an' try to stop the Japanese wherever they are.	[]
Stan	6	0	Really?  People who are doing something?	[]
Butters	11	0	I watch their show all the time. And, they take volunteers.	[]
Stan	6	0	Then that's where I belong.	[]
Singer	8	0	The world is a vampire, sent to drain.	[]
Captain Paul Watson	4	1	Yeah, we're badass.	['badass']
Singer	13	0	Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage.	[]
Male Crew 1	10	0	Any means necessary! We're not protesters, we're pirates!	[]

"Crew, Stan"	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Captain	3	1	Are we badasses?	['badasses']
"Crew, Stan"	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Captain	32	0	All right, so... what do we do?  Wait, I know. How about we go on their ship, and then beat ourselves up? And then we can tell the media they did it?	[]
Crewman	3	0	Great idea, Captain!	[]
Aussie Crewman	5	0	I'll start right now.	[]
Woman	11	0	Oy my God, Luke's been hurt trying to save whales.	[]
Captain	33	0	Wait, wait wait. I've got a better idea. How about I pretend to be shot? Then we can tell the media the Japanese shot me, a-and start an international c-crisis?	[]
Stan	11	0	Whoa, wait wait, we don't wanna just lie about stuff.	[]
Captain	2	0	Why not?	[]
Stan	19	1	Well, 'cause then we're just douchebags, dude. Come on, they're right here. Let, let's get hardcore!	['douchebags']

Stan	4	0	Wait, that's it?	[]
Captain	15	1	Yeah, we make 'em stink. Haha your boat is stinky! Here, th- here, throw one.	['stinky']
Stan	24	0	Those guys are always covered in dolphin and whale guts. They don't care if they stink. Come on, let's break their boat.	[]
Captain	6	0	Well no, that'd be illegal.	[]
Crewman 2	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Stan	9	0	I thought you guys were pirates in a war!	[]
Woman	7	0	I'm a pirate in a war.	[]
Stan	13	1	Pirates don't worry about the law! You guys said you were badasses!	['badasses']
Captain	25	0	We are. People think our methods are extreme. But we'll keep making their boats stink as long as they're killing whales and dolphins!	[]
Luke	9	0	The Japanese are scared of how hardcore we are.	[]
Woman	1	0	Paul!	[]
Crewman	1	0	Paul?	[]
Crewman 2	4	0	What do we do?	[]
Woman	6	0	We don't have a captain!	[]
Crewman	6	0	Oh my God, oh my God!	[]
Woman 2	4	0	Maybe he's okay.	[]
Crewman 2	3	0	Oh my God.	[]
Luke	4	0	What did you do?	[]

The Japanese	3	0	Ohhhh Gojira! Gojira!	[]
Hatoyama	6	0	Nippon no gaijin!  Kuso, taberu na!	[]
Announcer	5	0	And now, Larry King, live.	[]
Larry King	29	0	My guest tonight is the little boy who took over the Whale Wars reality show and turned it into a big hit. Please welcome Stan Marsh and his crew.	[]
Luke	8	0	'Ey Jordan! I'm on Larry King, mate!	[]
Larry King	18	0	So Stan, what motivated you, what... inspired you to get out there and make a hit TV show?	[]
Stan	24	0	No I, I don't really care about the TV show, I'm just trying to stop the Japanese from killing dolphins and whales.	[]
Larry King	24	0	Once you became captain the methods used to stop the Japanese definitely became more aggressive. Was that the key to help boost your ratings?	[]
Stan	8	0	...No, I don't care about the show.	[]
Woman 2	3	0	We're pirates.	[]
Stan	19	2	I just want people to know that you can stop the Japanese if you have some real goddamned balls	['goddamned', 'balls']
Woman 2	4	1	I've got balls!	['balls']
Larry King	40	0	Well there are many people who see what you're doing as a positive thing, and of course, many that see problems with it. Joining us now is one of those people and...  You say Stan's methods are unethical.	[]
Sid	35	0	Larry, you can't just go out and take matters into your own hands like this. If you want a hit TV show you have to go through producers, directors, people that are in unions.	[]
Larry King	33	0	But Sid, you saw the show before Stan took it over; you have to admit that it was nothing but incompetent vegan pussies doing absolutely nothing and trying to turn it into drama.	[]
Sid	20	0	Yes, but it doesn't justify changing the entire show structure that their old captain had pitched to the network.	[]
Stan	13	0	Can we please just talk about the actual whaling problem for a second?!	[]
Larry King	26	1	But their old captain, Paul Watson , was an unorganized incompetent media whore who thought lying to everyone was okay as long as it served his cause.	['whore']
Sid	20	0	He yes, of course, everyone knows that Paul Watson was a smug, narcoleptic liar with no credibility, but we must-	[]
Stan	8	0	Screw this, I gotta get back to work!	[]
Announcer	21	0	On this episode of Real Actual Whale Wars, Captain Marsh searches for the Japanese fleet, knowing they could be absolutely anywhere.	[]
Stan	7	0	Would you mind stepping back a little?	[]
Luke	13	0	Captain! Captain, some new volunteers showed up to help us in our crusade!	[]
Stan	10	0	No- Dude, we really can't take any more volunteers.	[]
Luke	6	0	But they say you know them.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Ahall right dude, this is pretty sweet! .	[]
Stan	4	0	Oh no, no, NO.	[]
Cartman	2	0	What dude?	[]
Stan	18	0	Oh what? So now that I have a hit TV show you guys care about dolphins and whales?	[]
Cartman	3	0	We always have.	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Yeah, totally!)	[]
Stan	11	0	I asked you guys to help me and you said no!	[]
Cartman	6	0	That's not what we said.	[]
Stan	15	2	You said Stan, me and Kenny don't give two shits about stupid-ass whales!	['shits', 'ass']
Cartman	7	0	We were talking about Wales the country.	[]
Stan	28	0	Look, if you admit that you're only doing this because you wanna be on TV, then I'll consider it! Admit you just wanna be on TV!	[]
Kenny	7	0	(I just want to be on TV.)	[]
Cartman	7	0	Kenny!  I deserve to be on TV.	[]
Crewman 2	10	0	Captain! Captain, the Japanese have been spotted near buoy 24!	[]
Stan	9	0	Take us out of port! All hands to stations!	[]
Cartman	10	0	All right! Let's go save those whales, you guys!	[]
Announcer	29	0	Captain Marsh races his boat to the last known location of the Japanese whalers. If he doesn't get there in time, hundreds of dolphins or whales could die.	[]
Stan	21	0	As soon as we get there, we've gotta deploy the tracking device! We can't let those whales get hurt!	[]
Crewman 2	5	1	What the hell was that?!	['hell']
Crewman 3	4	0	We just got rammed.	[]
Stan	8	0	Oh the Japanese wanna play that way, huh?!	[]
Crewman 4	5	0	It's not the Japanese.	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Announcer	22	0	On deck the crew is surprised at what they see. The other boat is from Deadliest Catch, a crab-fishing reality show.	[]
DC Captain	26	0	You think you're so cool, don'tcha?! You think you're big boat reality show on the block?!  You're taking away men's livelihoods!	[]
Stan	10	0	What? Dude, we're trying to get to some whales.	[]
DC Captain	11	1	You're taking viewers away from our show, you stupid ass!	['ass']
Cartman	6	2	Your show is fuckin' gay, dude!	['fuckin', 'gay']
DC Crewman	5	2	Your show is fuckin' gay!	['fuckin', 'gay']
Stan	6	0	Screw this! Turn hard to port!	[]
Announcer	16	0	But everywhere his reality show's boat turns, the crab fishing reality boat block its path.	[]
Stan	3	1	Dude, fuck you!	['fuck']
DC Captain	2	1	Fuck you!	['fuck']
Announcer	46	0	It's been three hours and the crab fishing reality show isn't budging.  Captain Marsh's boat is dead in the water. He can't go after the Japanese, he can't help the whales or dolphins. Once again on Whale Wars, nothing is happening.	[]
Crewman 3	22	0	It's pretty difficult times because uh, we know that every minute we're sitting here stopped, a, another whale is dying.	[]
Cartman	26	0	Really tough, you know. It's... really hard. It's like , we've dedicated all this time and all our lives to saving these majestic creatures.	[]
Kenny	5	0	(And they're all shot.)	[]
Cartman	45	0	Shhh, Kenny...  Old Ken is taking it especially hard. He's always loved dolphins so much that he-  Yeah yeah but, but keep it in a two-shot, though.  Yeah, keep it there.  He's always loved dolphins so much that he would do anything.	[]
Kenny	4	0	(I would do anything!)	[]
Announcer	9	0	The crab-fishing reality show was doing just fine.	[]
DC Crew	3	0	Yeah! Woohoo! Alright!	[]
Announcer	17	0	But for the Whale Wars crew, it appears the show is over. Until... a sound is heard.	[]
Stan	3	0	What was that?	[]
Benjamin	2	0	Captain, look!	[]
The Crew	2	0	Wow. Whoa.	[]
Woman 2	10	0	The whales are taking out the crab fisherman reality show!	[]
Stan	5	0	It's like... they know.	[]
DC Crewmen	4	0	Hey. Heeey. Noo! Stop!	[]
Stan	14	0	They do know. They know everything I've been trying to do for them.	[]
Cartman	22	0	Our gentle friends of the sea have saved the day. Because they know that only we can save them from the Japanese.	[]
Japanese Pilot	1	0	Bonzaaaaaaaai!	[]
Stan	11	0	Jesus Christ!  We've gotta get something to shoot 'em with!	[]
Woman 2	2	0	Look out!	[]
Stan	9	0	I, I can't, I can't believe it.	[]
Cartman	13	0	Dude, you know what? Japanese people really do not like whales.  Uh oh.	[]
Cartman	27	0	Well I'm in Japanese prison Lawd Japanese prison got me down Said I'm in Japanese prison Lawd Don't belong here, my eyes are round.	[]
Stan	4	0	Will you stop that?	[]
Cartman	23	0	Oh, I'm sorry. Am I making things uncomfortable for you Stan? It's your fault me and Kenny are in this mess!	[]
Stan	30	1	Things are bad enough without you being a smartass! There's whales out there being slaughtered right now and I can't do anything about it, so just keep quiet!	['smartass']
Cartman	30	2	You don't have a TV show anymore, Captain, so you can just suck my Japanese-imprisoned balls!  I'm in a Japanese prison Lawd.  Japanese balls got me down.	['balls', 'balls']
Guard	5	0	Itte kure 'Akihito-sama irashaimasu!'	[]
Emperor Akihito	12	0	So, you are the ones who have been-a sinking our boats!	[]
Stan	3	0	You speak English.	[]
Emperor Akihito	11	0	You have caused us many problems, set us back many months!	[]
Cartman	15	1	Sir, we actually don't give two shits about you killing whales. Can we go?	['shits']
Kenny	4	0	(Yeah, can we go?)	[]
Emperor Akihito	16	0	Why have you done this? Why do you insist on-a making trouble for the Japanese?!	[]
Stan	26	0	Why do you do what you do?! Do you know that ninety eight percent of the world is against whaling?! Why can't you just stop?!	[]
Emperor Akihito	19	0	You think you have the right to tell us what is okay?! I have-a something to show you!	[]
Emperor Akihito	28	0	This is Hiroshima. Over fifty years ago this entire city was-a destroyed by nuclear bomb. We built this museum so that we never forget what-a happened.	[]
Cartman	2	0	What dude?	[]
Emperor Akihito	61	0	At-a 8:15 a.m. the people of Hiroshima were just minding their own business when out of nowhere a frash devastated them all.  Women and children who died in the frash simply evaporated.  Those reft arrive suffered the worst pain of all. Burns, radiation poisoning. For generations the radiation affected the victims. Japanese babies born without rimbs. Without eyes!	[]
Cartman	6	1	Sorry.  A little gassy. 'Scuse me.	['gassy']
Emperor Akihito	66	1	One hundred and forty thousand Japanese were killed by atom bomb. We have never recovered from the memory of that day. It is impossible for a nation to ever forgive an act so horrible. This-a picture shows the prane that dropped the bomb.  It was called the Enora Gay. And it was frown by the monsters who dropped the bomb that day. Dohfin, and Weiru!	['gay']
Stan	7	0	Ummm, where did you get that picture?	[]
Emperor Akihito	53	2	The Americans were nice enough to give it to us the day after the bombing. We were so-a thankful for the picture that the next day we ended our war with America. We will never forgive, never rest until they are all wiped out! Fuck you. Fuck you dohfin and-a weiru!	['fuck', 'fuck']
Cartman	9	0	So that's what this has all been about?	[]
Stan	16	0	Dude, it wasn't actually and dolfin and a whale who bombe Hiroshima. It was the-	[]
Cartman	15	0	Zzzzt zzzzsssht!  Dude, they won't rest until whoever is responsible is completely wiped out.	[]
Stan	18	0	Oh, right. Look, I... I thnk I can make everything okay here. Can I just use a phone?	[]
Kyle	2	0	Hello? Stan?	[]
Stan	15	0	Dude, are you sitting at your computer? I need you to do something for me.	[]
Stan	74	1	Mister Prime Minister, Japanese officials, there's something you need to know. The photo you were given of the Enola Gay was doctored. Because the real bombers feared retaliation so badly that they... simply pointed the finger at somebody else. My government has authorized me to give you the original photo, unaltered, so you can finally know the truth.  Dolphins and whales were just framed by the real bombers.  A chicken and a cow.	['gay']
Emperor Akihito	8	0	Chicken and-a cow? Chicken and-a cow?!	[]
Hatoyama	14	0	Chicken and cow use poor dohfin and weiru as-a scapegoat?! This is outrage!	[]
The Japanese	3	1	Fuck you cows!	['fuck']
The Japanese	2	0	Teikara chickens!	[]
Randy	10	0	Great job, son. Now the Japanese are normal, like us.	[]
