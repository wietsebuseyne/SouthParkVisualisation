Mitch Conner	39	1	Saigon. It's a hell of a place. I've seen a lot of death.  A lot of suffering. Darkness that most people couldn't stand to see.  I tried to sit it out as much as I could.	['hell']
Soldier 1	12	0	What's the matter, Conner? You don't like a little blood?	[]
Mitch Conner	28	0	No, I don't like a little blood. Blood ain't the stuff for eighteen year old boys from Sheboygan. Blood ain't the stuff... for Mitch Conner.	[]
Soldier 2	1	0	Incoming!	[]
Army Doctor	6	0	Conner, Mitchell. You're discharged, son.	[]
Mitch Conner	71	0	And that's that. Pack your bags, you're headed home. Hugs and kisses from Uncle Sam.  So how do I end up here, with a nine year old kid who just wants to know who his father is? Life is funny like that. One day you're sifting through the guts of some gook in Vietnam and the next you're playing Dr. Phil with some kid and his teacher.	[]
Mr. Garrison	13	0	Eric I,  I'm really sorry that you were put through all this.	[]
Mitch Conner	21	0	Sorry is a four letter word with a y on the end. That doesn't mean anything to this poor kid.	[]
Cartman	8	0	That's right! Tell me the truth! Now!	[]
Mr. Garrison	41	0	All I can tell you, Eric, is that we were all told to stick to the story, to protect someone very important. I can't say more, I won't. But I'll... I'll tell you who has the answer.	[]
Randy	12	1	Look, gingers! You said you wanted Muhammad, we got him for you.	['gingers']
Ginger 1	17	0	We have no way of knowing if Muhammad is really in there. It could be a trick.	[]
Stan	19	0	It's no trick, dude. My friend and I went to the Super Best Friends and brought him here!	[]
Ginger 1	17	0	Then have him step out of the bear costume! You have until the count of ten! One!	[]
Jimbo	13	0	Don't do it, Randy. If Muhammad is seen, we could get bombed.	[]
Ginger 1	1	0	Two!	[]
Sgt. Yates	13	0	Idiot, if he isn't seen, we're about to definitely get bombed.	[]
Ginger 1	1	0	Three!	[]
Randy	22	0	Alright, alright, stop! We'll do what you say.  I'm sorry, Muhammad. Will you please step out of the bear costume?	[]
Stan	7	0	Okay, so um, see? This is Muhammad.	[]
Ginger 2	8	0	That isn't Muhammad, that's Santy Claus.	[]
Santa	4	0	Sorry, boys. I tried.	[]
Kyle	2	1	Aw crap.	['crap']
Randy	8	0	Boys, you got Santa to be Muhammad? When?	[]
Stan	25	0	When you all said you were gonna hand Muhammad over to Tom Cruise. We promised Jesus that Muhammad would stay safely in the U-Haul!	[]
Mr. Hankey	13	0	I'm sorry, Kyle. I really thought my idea would work for you.	[]
Stan	21	1	If we were gonna have someone in a bear costume, why would we actually have it be Muhammad, you fucking idiot?!	['fucking']
Ginger 1	4	0	So where is he?!	[]

Dr. Mephesto	17	0	There's a gas station about half a mile down the road. They have a phone there.	[]
Person	19	0	Okay, I see. I guess I understand. You just don't wanna let a black man in yo' house.	[]
Dr. Mephesto	8	0	No, please, it isn't that at all.	[]
Person	38	1	No, I gets it man. Thought things had changed, dog. Thought when we got a black president, things would be different. We gots our black president, but Whitey still don't trust me to use his motherfuckin' phone.	['motherfuckin']
Dr. Mephesto	20	0	No wait, I'm sorry, you're right you're right, we do have a black president. Please, come in.	[]

Tom Cruise	10	0	How do you like that?! Celebrities can get violent too!	[]
Randy	11	1	Mr. Cruise, please call Barbra Streisand off!  She's destroying everything!	['streisand']
Tom Cruise	10	0	We will call her off when you give us Muhammad!	[]

Stan	5	0	Oh thank God. Hey Muhammad.	[]
Kyle	20	0	Really sorry about all this, dude.  So what the heck are we gonna do now? Muhammad isn't safe here.	[]
Stan	18	1	The gingers and celebrities all want a piece of him. I don't know where we can go.	['gingers']
Kyle	14	0	Wait. No wait a minute! I've got it. I've totally got it!	[]
Kenny	1	0	(What?)	[]
Kyle	14	0	Remember the time when we got an elephant to make love to a pig?	[]
Stan	1	0	...Yeah.	[]
Kyle	21	1	I totally know how we can give the gingers and the celebrities what they want, but keep Muhammad safe. Come on!	['gingers']

Seaman	10	1	Look out! Barbra Streisand is using her toxic stink ray!	['streisand']
Dr. Mephesto	16	0	Eric, your father never wanted this to happen. He was protecting you as well as them.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Them who?!	[]
Dr. Mephesto	10	0	Eric, you have to understand, it's all very complicated.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Then start explaining it to me!	[]
Dr. Mephesto	2	0	Very well.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Come on, Muhammad, the door is open.	[]
Stan	6	0	Dr. Mephesto, we need your help!	[]
Dr. Mephesto	11	0	Oh for crying out loud, now everyone is letting themselves in!	[]
Kyle	21	2	Doctor, this is Muhammad. We want you to clone him, so we can give his copies to gingers, and Barbra Streisand.	['gingers', 'streisand']
Dr. Mephesto	3	0	Oh, all right.	[]
Cartman	16	0	No nooo no no no! He's not doing anything except explaining who my father is!	[]
Stan	9	0	Dude, that doesn't matter to people right now!	[]
Cartman	5	0	It's all that matters!	[]
Kyle	20	1	Dude, nobody gives a crap about who your stupid father is! Muhammad is an important issue with actual ethical ramifications!	['crap']
Cartman	12	0	I guarantee you people care way more about who my father is!	[]
Announcer	27	0	In the small mountain town of South Park, the holy prophet of the Mormon religion is trying to fly up the nose of a deadly female singer.	[]
Seaman	6	0	Our powers aren't working, Swallow.	[]
Joseph Smith	12	1	We can't attack Streisand's nose! It's just too big!	['streisand']
Jesus	8	0	We have to find another weak spot!  Moses!	[]
Moses	1	0	What?	[]
Jesus	10	1	We need to know any weakness Barbra Streisand might have!	['streisand']
Moses	18	1	Um... Let me think... Um... Oh I know... Barbra Streisand can't resist singing duets with Neil Diamond.	['streisand']
Jesus	36	0	All right. I'll build a stage. Lao Tse, use mind control to get a huge audience. Buddha and Smith, use powers to find a band. Seaman,  you and Swallow go get us sushi for dinner.	[]
Seaman	6	0	It's Sea-Man and Swallow.	[]
Jesus	6	0	Okay, Seaman, you guys head off!	[]
Seaman	3	0	Fine! Swallow, come.	[]
Moses	9	0	Heh heh heheheh. No way he just said that.	[]
Stan	16	0	Alright alright, just tell Cartman who his dad is real quick so we can clone Muhammad.	[]
Dr. Mephesto	12	0	It's a complicated story. I just can't tell him quickly.	[]
Kyle	11	0	Then we'll wait, because we have to clone Muhammad now!	[]
Mitch Conner	11	0	Is Muhammad more important than a little boy's broken heart?	[]
Kyle	7	0	Oh, you are not doing that again!	[]
Mitch Conner	15	0	Look, Mephesto, just tell this kid who his father is and you do it now!	[]
Kyle	6	0	Stop talking with your stupid hand!	[]
Cartman	5	1	Who you calling stupid, Jew?	['jew']
Stan	9	0	Come on, guys, we're running out of time!	[]
Dr. Mephesto	1	0	Yes?	[]
Man	18	0	Hey, I'm sorry to bother you. There's uh, been an accident and I need a phone.	[]
Dr. Mephesto	10	0	Yeah, right, let me guess: You're an African-American.	[]
Man	16	0	...Well, yes I am, but I don't know what that has to do with anything.	[]
Dr. Mephesto	7	0	Beat it I'm not helpin' you!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Dude!	[]
Stan	4	0	That's not cool!	[]
Dr. Mephesto	6	0	No no, you don't understand.	[]
Kyle	9	0	We understand you just sounded like a freakin' racist!	[]

Benedict XVI	6	0	They are sending a message now!	[]
Tom Cruise	2	0	On screen!	[]
Ginger 1	6	0	We got Muhammad! We got Muhammad!	[]
Rob Reiner	25	0	He's useless to you! You can't get Muhammad's power to not be made fun of without the Rob Reiner Goo Transfer Machine!	[]
Ginger 1	7	0	Why do you think we're calling?!	[]
Ginger 3	20	0	Our boss is willing to share Muhammad with you if you're willing to share the goo machine with us!	[]
Tom Cruise	2	0	...Your ...boss?	[]
Dr. Mephesto	14	1	What's going on? You got what you wanted, gingers, so let us go.	['gingers']
Ginger 1	10	1	Oh no no! The head ginger has plans for you!	['ginger']
Stan	7	1	What head ginger?! And where's Cartman?!	['ginger']
Ginger 2	11	1	Heheh, the head ginger has somethin' reeeally special planned for him.	['ginger']
Cartman	9	1	Hello? What the hell is this? Where am I?	['hell']
Mitch Conner	10	0	You really got yourself in a mess this time, kid.	[]

Krishna	26	1	Form of... Neil Diamond.  If you all wouldn't mind, I'd like to invite a special friend to join me on stage. Miss Barbra Streisand!	['streisand']
Jesus	7	0	Let's hope to Christ this works.	[]
Krishna	58	0	Hello gorgeous. What do you say? Shall we sing together again like the old times?  Well that's because I love the girl.  And I still love you now. What have you got to say?  That might be true, but I still miss ya at night.  When you roll over, by my side, and you kiss me goodnight.	[]
Joseph Smith	3	0	It worked, Jesus!	[]
Jesus	11	0	Yeah. And now to find Muhammad and take down Tom Cruise!	[]
Scott Tenorman	77	0	Do you remember when you had my parents killed and fed them to me as chili? I spent quite a while in a mental institution, Eric.  A lot of time for me to learn everything about you, so that one day I could take you down. I even learned the name of your father.  Oh, I know you're confused. Who wouldn't be?  You've been lied to by everyone!  Even by your own mother!  Hahahahahahahaha.	[]
Cartman	4	0	What do you know?!	[]
Scott Tenorman	23	0	I wanted to torment you with your father's identity. But what I found was more shocking than I could have possibly guessed!	[]

Cartman	1	0	Mom?	[]
Scott Tenorman	16	0	I got them all here for you, Eric! So listen while you got told the truth!	[]
Mr. Garrison	8	0	Please don't. We have to protect 'em.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Protect who??	[]
Scott Tenorman	7	0	Yes, protect... who? Tell him! Mr...  Jimbo!	[]
Jimbo	4	0	Protect... the Denver Broncos.	[]
Announcer	1	0	Meanwhile...	[]
Tom Cruise	8	0	This is incredible. Who wants to go next?	[]

Mickey Mouse	8	1	Gingers can suck it! I'm next, ha!	['gingers']
Rob Reiner	8	0	It's my goo machine! I'm next!	[]
Jesus	13	0	Nobody is going next!  Muhammad is our super best friend! Let him go!	[]
Ginger 4	9	0	They can't stop all of us! Get 'em!	[]
Jesus	1	0	Kyaaaaa!	[]
Scott Tenorman	31	1	The Denver Broncos.  There was a right tackle, see? Who had an illegitimate child with your slut of a mom, and everyone here covered it up! To protect the Bronco name!	['slut']
Mr. Garrison	13	0	They were having a really good year! There couldn't be any distractions!	[]
Cartman	6	0	My dad was a Denver Bronco?	[]
Scott Tenorman	33	0	Would you like to meet him? Well, you can't. Ever. 'Cause you see, Eric, we have something in common. Did I ever tell you that my father... played for the Denver Broncos?	[]
Cartman	2	0	No- nooo.	[]
Scott Tenorman	25	1	The only Bronco who lived in South Park. He got a little bored one week and had an affair with a slut named Liane Cartman!	['slut']
Liane	2	0	No please!	[]
Scott Tenorman	20	0	Tell him! You almost did before but you got shot by your brother who was a Bronco fan! Tell him!	[]
Dr. Mephesto	8	0	It's true... Jack Tenorman was your father.	[]
Scott Tenorman	14	0	You killed your own father and then you fed him to your half... brother!	[]
Cartman	2	0	No! Noooo!	[]

Tom Cruise	4	0	What did you say?!	[]
Kyle	10	0	Oh yeah. Tom Cruise does have Seaman on his back.	[]
Jesus	7	0	I guess maybe Tom Cruise likes Seaman.	[]
Tom Cruise	22	1	Whoawhoa whoa whoa!  You're not supposed to be able to make fun of me anymore! What the hell's going on?!	['hell']
Scott Tenorman	7	0	I'll be back, Super Best Friends!	[]
Jesus	6	1	Who's the creepy ginger kid?	['ginger']
Tom Cruise	14	0	Reiner, you said the goo machine would work! But I got made fun of!	[]
Kyle	75	0	That's because there is no goo, Mr. Cruise. You see, I learned something today. Throughout this whole ordeal, we've all wanted to show things that we weren't allowed to show. But it wasn't because of some magic goo. It was because of the magical power of threatening people with violence. That's obviously the only true power. If there's anything we've all learned, it's that terrorizing people works.	[]
Jesus	31	1	That's right. Don't you see, gingers?  If you don't want to be made fun of anymore, all you need are guns and bombs to get people to stop.	['gingers']
Santa	31	0	That's right, friends. All you need to do is instill fear and be willing to hurt people and you can get whatever you want. The only true power is violence.	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Mayor McDaniels	12	0	Alright, people, let's start rebuilding our town! For the 39th time.	[]
Stan	5	0	Oh dude, look.  Hey, Cartman...	[]
Kyle	13	0	Look man, w-we know what you learned was pretty tough to hear.	[]
Cartman	18	0	Tough to hear? My dad was Scott Tenorman's dad. Don't you guys realize what that means?	[]
Stan	8	0	Yeah dude, we, we know what it means.	[]
Cartman	5	1	My dad was a ginger!	['ginger']
Kyle	2	0	Wwait, what?	[]
Cartman	17	1	I mean, obviously I take after my mom, but I have the ginger gene inside of me!	['ginger']
Kyle	12	0	Dude, you killed your own dad, and you're worried about that?!	[]
Mitch Conner	3	0	Hey Eric, Eric!	[]
Cartman	1	0	What?	[]
Mitch Conner	4	0	Come on, cheer up.	[]
Cartman	6	1	Cheer up? I'm half ginger!	['ginger']
Mitch Conner	16	0	Yeah, but you're forgetting, you're also half Denver Bronco. That makes you pretty cool.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Hey, you're right. That does make me pretty cool.	[]
Kyle	5	0	You gotta be kidding me!	[]
Mitch Conner	24	1	Shut up Kyle, you dumb Jew.  You've got Bronco blood in you, kid. That makes you awesome. Me? I should be movin' on.	['jew']
Cartman	7	0	Really Mitch? Ya, you've gotta go?	[]
Mitch Conner	24	0	There's a bounty on my head and I can't afford to stay in one place for too long. So long... Denver Bronco.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Take it easy, Conner.	[]
Stan	19	0	Look, Mr. Cruise, I'm sorry I said you were a fudge packer and that seaman on your back.	[]
Tom Cruise	27	0	I... I just can't do it anymore. I wanna go away. But there's nowhere on earth that people aren't around to rip on me.	[]
Kyle	26	0	Hey... Hey, we know a place! We know a place where everything is just happiness and joy. And no humans are there to mess it up.	[]
Stan	7	0	We do? Oh Oh yeah, we do!	[]
Tom Cruise	24	0	You... really? Somewhere where I can just ...live out my days in peace and quiet and- Oh.  Oh please, can you show me where?	[]
Stan	12	0	We'll do better than that. We'll help you get there.	[]
