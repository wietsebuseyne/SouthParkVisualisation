Cartman	2	1	'Sup, Jew?	['jew']
Kyle	19	0	Guys, Ike has gotten worse. I'm really worried about him. He says he's still seeing dead celebrities.	[]
Cartman	4	1	HA! What a dumbass!	['dumbass']
Kyle	25	0	I don't know. Last night we found him hiding in the kitchen pantry. He was screaming the name Billy Mays over and over again.	[]
Cartman	15	0	Billy Mays? Billy Mays?!  Dude, you didn't tell us Ike was seeing Billy Mays!	[]

Cartman	9	0	Your little brother saw the ghost of Billy Mays?	[]
Stan	9	0	Dude, I don't even know who that is.	[]

Billy Mays	29	0	Hi, Billy Mays here with another fantastic product. If you're like other Americans, you love to eat Chipotle , but you hate all those terrible bloodstains in your underwear .	[]
Man 1	15	0	I love Chipotle. But getting all the bloodstains out of my underwear is a nightmare.	[]
Billy Mays	83	0	Well now there's a product that can clean even bloodstains caused by Chipotle right off your underwear. Chipotl-away.  Just one Chipotle burrito  can leave up to a quarter cup of underwear blood , but Chipotl-away  makes your underwear clean  and ready for more.  Stop buying new underwear every time you eat Chipotle. That can cost you thousands. Chipotl-away gets rid of bloodstains and leaves underwear good as new.  Imagine having underwear so clean you can practically eat off of it.	[]
Man 2	2	0	Mmm, Chipotle.	[]
Billy Mays	20	0	Now you can eat all the Chipotle you want , and still have underwear that sparkles and shines . Order right now!	[]
Cartman	14	0	That product changed my life. It really works. I use it all the time.	[]
Kyle	4	0	What?! Are you serious?!	[]
Cartman	23	0	Look Kyle, if there's even a chance that Billy Mays' soul is not at rest, then I wanna help however I can.	[]
Kyle	8	1	Dude, why the hell would you DO that?!	['hell']
Cartman	7	0	Because he was a great person, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	14	2	NO, why the hell would you keep eating something that made you crap blood?!	['hell', 'crap']
Cartman	34	0	...Dude, have you had Chipotle? It's really good. You guys, we have to help Kyle's brother and get to the bottom of this. And I think I know just who to call...	[]
Announcer	43	2	On this episode of Ghost Hunters : a little boy in Colorado appears to be haunted by celebrities.  Now the Ghost Hunter team will roll out and get to the bottom of it. It's the gayest show in the fucking world; Ghost Hunters!	['gayest', 'fucking']
Jason	9	0	Alright, tell us what we got this week, Kris.	[]
Kris	9	0	We're going to Colorado to investigate celebrity paranorm-	[]
Jason	8	0	Wait, what? What was that? What was that?	[]
Grant	11	0	I heard it too. It was like a, like a ...*pop*	[]
Jason	5	0	Is there a ghost here?	[]
Jason	11	0	Alright, so you say a little boy is seeing the ghosts?	[]
Kris	7	0	Yeah, apparently only he is seeing them.	[]
Jason	20	0	Doyuh ssh ssh. What, what is that? Do you hear that?! There, there look. What is that? What is that?	[]
Grant	8	0	I think that's just a cigarette lighter.	[]
Jason	5	0	Oh, right, okay. May be.	[]
Jason	19	0	We are now inside the house where the celebrity ghosts have been spotted. Whoa whoa what? What was that?	[]
Kyle	3	0	What was what?	[]
Jason	27	0	Did you hear that? It was like a... it was like a... dee.. Is there a spooky ghost here?? Uh LOOK. What is that? What is that??	[]
Grant	8	0	I'm pretty sure that's their television.	[]
Jason	28	0	Oh man I am really scared.  Whoa whoa whoa whoa! What is this? What is this? There's a, there's a, a wetness coming from my pants!	[]
Grant	3	0	I see it!	[]
Jason	4	0	W... what is it?!	[]
Grant	10	0	Oh God I'm so scared!  I'm so scared.	[]
Jason	22	0	Look! Look, it's got you too!  Are you getting this? Make sure the camera is getting this. Definitely some paranormal activity!	[]
Grant	16	0	It's warm, and moist. A warm moist sensation that's moving down my left thigh.	[]
Jason	18	0	Look, it's starting to form a, a a pool around the floor now. Are you getting this??	[]
Stan	5	1	Are you guys fucking serious?	['fucking']
Jason	18	0	Oh God, the paranormal activity is now leaving a, a trail of some kind behind both of us!	[]
Grant	15	0	Hoh! Something... hot, and and, warm is coming out the back of my pants now.	[]

Billy Mays	10	0	Hi, Billy Mays here for the Big City Slider Station.	[]
Kyle	8	0	It's all just in your head, Ike.	[]
Billy Mays	11	0	The fast and easy way to press and cook delicious sliders	[]
Ike	2	0	AAAAA. AAAAAAAAAAA!!	[]
Kyle	6	0	I just... don't understand it.	[]
Stan	6	0	It's gonna be alright, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	33	1	But, dude this doesn't make any sense. I mean, if you know it's going to make you crap blood, why wouldn't you at least just try eating less of it?	['crap']
Cartman	17	0	Because, dude, that's what I'm saying. You have the Chipotlaway so it doesn't matter.	[]
Kyle	20	0	But of course it matters, because you should be concerned there's blood in your underwear.  Do you understand this?	[]
Stan	20	1	Dude, I don't understand at all. I eat Chipotle all the time and it never made me crap blood.	['crap']
Cartman	26	0	Ohh well how nice for you, Stan. It's great you've got a golden rectum of the gods, but the rest of us need Chipotlaway.	[]
Dr. Carroll	20	0	Well boys, little Ike is stable, but the celebrity ghosts appear to have sent him into some kind of coma.	[]
Stan	7	0	Whoa whoa wait, there really are ghosts?	[]
Dr. Carroll	37	0	Well of course there really are ghosts. Haven't you seen that show Ghost Hunters? But I'm a pediatric doctor, so I'm going to hand this off to Dr. Phillips, who specializes in spooky things.	[]
Dr. Phillips	37	0	The ghosts of these celebrities are at deep unrest. I've never sensed anything like it.  I believe these celebrity ghosts are still roamin' the world, reachin' out through the child because they are lost in purgatory.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Purgatory? What's that?	[]
Dr. Phillips	154	1	Sometimes when people die, they can't quite accept what has happened to them. And so before they reach the afterlife, they go to a place called purgatory. It is a temporary plane of existence. It's neither heaven, nor hell. Purgatory is like... being on an airplane that's waiting to take off, but you're still sitting at the gate. And even though the plane isn't taking off, they won't let you back off the plane. And you can't get up to go to the bathroom, because you're on an active runway. All these dead celebrities are sittin' on the plane waiting and wantin' to move on, but for whatever reason, they are stuck without any information, even from the pilot, how much longer it's going to be, and it's taking forever. And they aren't serving any drinks yet. It's like, a terrifying limbo.	['hell']
Cartman	6	0	Oh my God... poor Billy Mays...	[]
Dr. Phillips	22	0	I am speakin to the celebrities that are hauntin' this child. If any spirit can hear my voice, make your presence known.	[]
Billy Mays	8	0	Hi, Billy Mays here with another fantastic product.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Billy Mays!  It's him!	[]
Billy Mays	11	0	Are you tired of having to put your toilet seat down?	[]
Cartman	6	0	Yes! Yes I am, Billy Mays!	[]
Walter Cronkite	11	0	No! Be quiet, Billy Mays! Somebody is trying to contact us!	[]
Dr. Phillips	7	0	To which celebrity am I addressin' now?	[]
Walter Cronkite	4	0	This, is Walter Cronkite.	[]
Dr. Phillips	11	0	All you celebrities need to know that you have passed on.	[]
Farrah Fawcett	3	0	We know that!	[]
DJ AM	6	0	Yeah! Of course we know that!	[]
Patrick Swayze	10	0	There's only one person here who's not cooperating!	[]
Walter Cronkite	12	0	That's right! Now just admit you're dead and sit down!	[]
Michael Jackson	8	0	...No, that's ignorant! I'm not dead.	[]
Stan	2	0	Uh oh.	[]
Walter Cronkite	3	0	You are dead!	[]
Michael Jackson	7	0	No, I just have a skin condition.	[]
Dr. Phillips	9	0	Boys, quickly! Convince Michael Jackson that he's dead.	[]
Kyle	1	0	What?	[]
Dr. Phillips	23	0	He's in denial. He's been in denial all his life. Now tell him or you're gonna lose your little brother.	[]
Kyle	11	0	Mister... Jackson, y-you aren't alive. You're in purgatory.	[]
Michael Jackson	17	0	Nooo, you're being ignorant. I'm alive. And I'm a child. And I'm white.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Mr. Jackson, please, you're causing a lot of problems.	[]
Billy Mays	8	0	Hi, Billy Mays here for the Super Sweeper.	[]
The Boys (except Cartman) and Dr. Phillips	4	0	Shut up, Billy Mays!	[]
Stan	5	0	You're dead, Mr. Jackson!	[]
Michael Jackson	7	0	No, that's, that's just ignorant.	[]
Stan	2	0	Accept it!	[]
Michael Jackson	1	0	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!	[]
Dr. Phillips	7	0	He's in too much denial!  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!	[]
Kyle	30	0	Ike! Ike! Wake up buddy! Wake up! Ike, you've gotta wake up, please!  Eh there you go. That's good.  Oh Ike. I thought I lost you, little brother.	[]
Ike	14	0	Nooo. No, that's ignorant.  Oh look everyone, I told you I was alive.	[]
Kyle	11	1	Hey! What the hell are you doing inside my little brother?!	['hell']
Ike	23	0	Wee, I'm a child!  I knew I was a child. See? Come on, let's play! Let's go climb a tree!	[]
Kenny	3	1	(Holy shit, dude!)	['shit']
Kyle	3	0	Comoe back here!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Hey! Heeey!	[]
Ike	9	0	Come on, let's climb the tree! Hee hee!	[]
Stan	12	0	Mr. Jackson, you can't do this! This is not your body!	[]
Ike	16	0	Noo, I'm a little white child. Let's play!  Hee! Hee hee!  Hee hee hee!	[]
Kyle	12	1	Dude, asshole, you're keeping a lot of other celebrities in purgatory!	['asshole']
Cartman	8	0	Including the late and very talented Billy Mays!	[]
Ike	35	0	No, that's ignorant. People are just ignorant and they lie and spread rumors about me. Like, that I'm dead. But if I was dead, how could I do this?  Hoo! Dawdaby daw! Shamon!	[]
Kyle	8	1	What the hell are we going to do??	['hell']
Ike	7	0	Jou know! Jou know it! Hee hee!	[]
Ed McMahon	15	0	Come on, this is ridiculous! How much longer do we have to sit in purgatory?!	[]
Passengers	9	0	Come on! Come on! This is ridiculous! Come on!	[]
Flight Attendant	25	0	Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for your patience. I've been informed that we are going to be delayed at least another 96 hours	[]
Passengers	1	0	AWWWWWWWW!	[]
DJ AM	11	0	Yo, you can't just keep people stuck like this, man!	[]
Flight Attendant	24	0	We know that you are all excited to cross over to the next plane, but for now you have to stay on this one.	[]
Walter Cronkite	10	0	That's it! I have to go to the bathroom!	[]
Flight Attendant	12	0	Sir, you have to stay in your seat with your seatbelt fastened!	[]
Walter Cronkite	9	0	You've been saying that for three months now!	[]
Stan	13	0	Alright, let's see: demonic ghosts, animal ghosts...  ...setting traps for ghosts, no...	[]
Kyle	26	0	Okay, here's the one part that really makes no sense to me:  the first time you saw blood stains on your underwear, were you alarmed?	[]
Cartman	8	0	Was I alarmed?  Yes.  I believe I was.	[]
Kyle	14	0	So then why do you just ignore it using something as stupid as Chipotaway?	[]
Cartman	18	0	Chipotlaway, Kyle. And I'm not the one who uses it, my mom does. She does the laundry.	[]
Kyle	12	0	Your mom... uses Chipotlaway... to clean blood stains... out of your underwear?	[]
Cartman	1	0	Yes!	[]
Kyle	10	0	And then takes you to Chipotle, and buys you more?	[]
Cartman	22	1	Yes, Kyle, it's totally normal!  People do this stuff! You know, not everyone can be the boy with the golden butthole!	['butthole']
Stan	58	0	Here here here it is: possession by a ghost. A ghost that enters and then refuses to leave a living host has done so because it failed in the living world to be what it wanted to be. The ghost must be allowed to transform and be recognized by the living as what it always tried to be.	[]
Kyle	8	0	What has Michael Jackson always tried to be?	[]
Cartman	7	0	A child... and a female. And white.	[]
Ike	9	0	Oh lookie, it's a planet. Hee hee hee.	[]
Stan	15	0	So he wants to finally be accepted by the living as a little white girl.	[]
Kyle	28	1	Well what the hell are we gonna do? Dress him up in a princess gown and, and parade him around like the parents on those awful child pageants?	['hell']
MC	9	0	Hello. First up we have the beautiful Miss Jessica.	[]
Jessica's Mom	3	0	Alright Jessica! Woohoo!	[]

Brandy's Mom	5	0	Yeah Brandy! Work it girl!	[]
MC	10	0	Brandy likes ice cream and playing with her cat Sunshine.	[]
Brandy's Mom	11	0	Don't forget to blow a kiss to the judges, Brandy.	[]
MC	10	0	And now welcome contestant number 27, little Miss Michael Jackson.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Go on by, Michael.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Yeah yeah rah work it Michael work it!	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeahhhh!	[]
MC	23	0	Michael says she just enjoys being a child. She loves to play and climb trees, and thinks people who don't are ignorant.	[]
Ike	1	0	Ignorant.	[]
Cartman	5	0	God I hope this works.	[]
Billy Mays	33	0	Hi, Billy Mays here for the little Country Handy Pillow. Are you tired of sitting in limbo? Lost somewhere between planes of existence? Well now there's a product that can help you-	[]

Pilot	35	0	Certainly want to uhhh thank you for all your patience. We know that you're eager to uhhhh get going and we will certainly pass on any information uhhhhh as it becomes uhhhhhh more available.	[]
DJ AM	21	0	But yo! Yo Michael Jackson isn't even here anymore! He's gone! We should be able to move on now!	[]
Flight Attendant	45	0	Yes, but as we all know, Mr. Jackson had a LOT of baggage, and he checked some of that baggage in, so a crew has to go through all the baggage and get his off of purgatory before we can push back from the gate.	[]
Passengers	1	0	AWWWWWWWW!	[]
Ike	20	0	Did I do good in the swimsuit category? I'm worried that little doodoohead brunette girl was prettier than me.	[]
Stan	22	0	Excuse me, uh, if you could do us a favor and pleeease just vote for little Miss Jackson? It's really important.	[]
Kylie's Mom	13	0	It's more important for my little Kylie. Just look at this face.	[]
Kylie	6	0	Mommy, that hurts my cheek implants.	[]

Kyle	11	0	We're totally screwed!  They took the two best judges away!	[]
Stan	18	0	Yeah, there's no way that lady judge is voting for us. She was glaring the entire time.	[]
Heidi's Mom	14	0	You'll win for sure, Heidi. You know how much that judge adores you.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Aw dide, this is hopeless!	[]
Kenny	5	1	(Son of a stinking bitch!)	['bitch']
Cartman	12	0	Wait wait! Wait, look at the lady judge.  She's eating Chipotle.	[]
Kyle	2	0	So what?!	[]
Cartman	22	0	So maybe she doesn't know.  Maybe she doesn't know, Kyle! Excuse me, Ma'am, I see you're eating Chipotle.	[]
Lady Judge	16	0	Oh yes, it's my favorite fast food. I would eat it every day, except I-...	[]
Cartman	10	0	Except! You can't afford buying all the new underwear?	[]
Lady Judge	18	0	How did you know-... Look, it doesn't matter.  I'm just gonna have to give it up.	[]
Cartman	10	0	What if you didn't have to give it up?	[]
Lady Judge	2	0	Excuse me?	[]
