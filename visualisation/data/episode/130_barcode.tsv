Stan	11	0	I don't suppose you guys want to win this game.	[]
Denver Player	9	1	Win? Why the hell would we want to win?	['hell']

Reporter	26	0	Little Stan Marsh is the pitcher for the South Park Little League team, and Stan, how does it feel to be playing for the State Championship?	[]

Reporter	10	0	Mr. Marsh, you must be very proud of your son.	[]
Randy	29	0	They've worked really hard to get here, Chris, and, you know, I don't like to really trash-talk, but, I don't think Denver has a chance.	[]
Reporter Chris	18	0	Oho, well, I'm sure some of the Denver kids' parents would disagree with you and your team-	[]
Bat dad	29	0	Oh yeah! Oh yeah!  South Park is goin' down! Feel it comin'!  You ain't got a chance, South Park! Here we go, Denver, here we go! Huh, huh!	[]
Sheila	3	0	Who's that?	[]
A Woman	29	0	That's Tom Nelson, one of the Denver players' fathers. He goes to every game in that ridiculous outfit and usually drinks too much and gets into a fight.	[]
Tom Nelson	19	0	There ain't no way some little mountain kids can beat Denver. Not with my son on second base!	[]
Reporter Chris	16	0	Oho, looks like we got some parental trash talking going on here. Mr. Marsh, any comments?	[]

Denver Player 4	10	0	Yeah, you can't lose to us. We're terrible.	[]
Kyle	12	0	Dude, what are we gonna do? We can't win this game.	[]
Cartman	29	0	Wiat. I've got it, you guys. A fifth point in a sports movie, the team always goes out and finds a really sweet player to join their team.	[]
Clyde	8	0	Like that motorcycle kid in Bad News Bears.	[]
Cartman	19	1	Exactly right, Clyde. So what we need... is to find somebody to join our team, who totally sucks ass.	['ass']
Stan	21	0	Hey yeah. We need to find the very worst kid athlete in the whole world. Somebody who can't possibly win.	[]
Craig	2	0	But who?	[]

Kyle	10	0	Dude, thanks for helping us out by joining our team.	[]
Kyle 1	46	0	Well, you said you needed my help to win the big game, so here I am. I'll need a wipe cloth if I'm gonna play, though. Sometimes I sweat from holding the bat for so long and then the heat steams up my glasses.	[]
Craig	3	0	He's perfect.	[]
Stan	12	0	Yeah, with him on our team, we don't stand a chance.	[]
Randy	5	0	...I'm not gonna go.	[]
Sharon	1	0	What?	[]
Randy	12	0	Stan's little league game, I'm... I'm not gonna go.	[]
Sharon	1	0	Why?	[]
Randy	9	0	I just... don't think I can, all right?	[]
Sharon	25	0	You don't think you can?! This is the biggest game of your son's life! Wny wouldn't you go and support him? What-?	[]
Randy	41	0	Because I'm scared, all right?!  You wanna break me down?! You wanna hear me say it?! I'm scared! I don't know if I believe in myself anymore.  I don't know if I can take this guy, Sharon.	[]
Sharon	24	0	So then, don't. You don't have to get in fights with other parents at Little League games! Just sit there and watch!	[]
Randy	29	0	Look, I get what you're trying to do. You're trying to get me to realize that I have to fight him because it's who I am.	[]
Sharon	21	1	No, I'm telling you you don't have to get thrown out of games and make an ass of yourself.	['ass']
Randy	21	0	I've lost the edge. I'm sorry, Sharon. But you have to take Stan to his Little League game alone.	[]

Cartman	18	0	I don't think so! You guys are way too good! You're the best at this game!	[]
Denver Pitcher	4	0	You're the best!	[]
Kyle	17	0	You guys are so good you'll probably go all the way to win the national title!	[]
Denver Pitcher	12	0	Not a chance, 'cause we're gonna lose to you right now!	[]
Bat Dad	16	0	Here we go, Denver! These South Park kids got nothin' on you! Let's go, Denver!	[]

Kyle	14	0	Oh my God... their pitcher was able to hit him right on the bat.	[]
