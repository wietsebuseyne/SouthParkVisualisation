Mr. Garrison	56	0	Oh, well excuse me, Kyle! Why don't you just forget what Barnaby Jones has to say?! Why don't you not pay attention to Barnaby Jones and then let's see how far you get in society?! Okay, Stanley, why don't you tell us how Barnaby Jones knew the poison was in the milk?	[]
Stan	13	0	Can't we just be like normal third-graders for a little while?	[]
Mr. Garrison	7	0	Oh, and what do you consider normal?!	[]

Cartman	7	0	I can sing the Cheesy Poofs song!	[]
Announcer	36	0	If you win, you could be picked to be in our next Cheesy Poofs commercial. So remember, I love Cheesy Poofs, you love Cheesy Poofs If we didn't eat Cheesy Poofs, we'd be lame	[]
Mr. Garrison	16	0	Okay, children, let's quiet down so the nice bus driver can concentrate on the road.	[]
Ms. Crabtree	16	0	THAT AIN'T HOW YOY DO IT! YOU DO IT LIKE THIS: SIDDOWN AND SHUT UP!!	[]
Mr. Garrison	3	0	Ow! Jesus, lady!	[]
Ms. Crabtree	17	0	THIS IS THE PLANETARIUM, WATCH YOUR STEP ON THE WAY DOWN SO AS NOT TO HURT YOURSEELF!	[]
Kid	1	0	Ow.	[]
Mr. Garrison	22	0	Okay, children, now I'm going to remind you that this is a planetarium, not a Bangkok brothel. Let's behave ourselves.	[]
Announcer	15	0	Does your child have what it takes to be the next Cheesy Poofs anthem singer?	[]

Cartman	14	0	I can sing the Cheesy Poofs song with both hands tied behnd my back!	[]
Kyle	10	0	You couldn't get both arms behind your back, fatass!	[]
Mr. Garrison	9	0	Come on, Eric. We're going to the planetarium.	[]
Cartman	16	0	But I'll have to sing the Cheesy Poofs song for that talent va-a-an!	[]
Mr. Garrison	18	0	No, you have to go in this building and see a bunch of stupid stars! Now, come on!	[]
Cartman	11	0	But I wanna sing the Cheesy Poofs song on the commercial!	[]
A Boy	4	0	Wow, don't you...?	[]
A Girl	3	0	What is that?	[]
Dr. Adams	12	0	Hello, children. My name is Dr. Adams. Welcome to the plane'arium.	[]
Kyle	6	0	I thought it was plane-tarium.	[]
Dr. Adams	20	0	Well, it is. But I have a bone disease which impedes my ability to pronounce the t in plane'arium	[]
Mr. Garrison	7	0	That's a pretty weird bone disease.	[]
Dr. Adams	13	0	Yes. Perhaps someday I can get a bone-marrow transplant.  Yes, little boy?	[]
Cartman	10	0	How long is that Chessy Poofs van gonna be outside?	[]
Dr. Adams	31	0	Well I don't know. But anyway, boys and girls, soon you'll be witnessing the wonders of the universe. But first, I wanna show you how the plane'arium works.	[]
Cartman	4	0	As if we care.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Hey, who are you?	[]
Dr. Adams	10	0	Ughuh, little Missy here runs the big projector for us.	[]
Missy	4	0	I love my work.	[]
Stan	15	0	Whoa, dude! You're only as old as us; shouldn't you be in school?	[]
Missy	4	0	I love my work.	[]
Dr. Adams	11	0	Come on. Let's get into the plane'arium, shall we?	[]
Dr. Adams	32	0	Good morning, children, and welcome to the plane'arium. We're going on a fascinating ride through the universe, so I want you to lean back in your chairs and get comfortable.	[]
Stan	3	0	This is stupid.	[]
Dr. Adams	15	0	And now I'm going to dim the lights and let the stars... ehcome out.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Whoopie.	[]
Dr. Adams	78	0	Here we see the constellation called, The Big Dipper. If I project a drawing of a big dipper on top of it,  a-hah , we see where this constellation gets its name. These stars over here form the constellation of Taurus, the Bull , while these stars form the constellation, Roger Ebert . And these two little stars over here form the constellation The Crusades . Now, stars are actually made of hot gas, which is exactly what comes out of...	[]
Cartman	4	0	Aw man, screw this.	[]
Dr. Adams	35	0	And now breathe deep as the stars sloowwly start to move in little circles.  I know you think plane'ariums are boring, but I'm gonna try to change the way you think about that.	[]
Boy	15	0	...you love Cheesy Poofs If we didn't eat Cheesy Poofs, we'd be lame	[]
Announcer	14	0	That was great, Tommy. Tommy Fritz from Torrey Pines! He could be our winner.	[]

Announcer	8	0	Oh, and what's your name, little boy?	[]
Cartman	2	0	Eric Cartman.	[]
Announcer	9	0	Alright, here's Eric Cartman giving it a shot.	[]
Tommy	1	0	Aaah!	[]
Cartman	31	0	I love Cheesy Poofs, you love Cheesy Poofs If we didn't eat Cheesy Poofs, we'd be lame. I'm talkin' Night-Court-in-it's-fifth-season lame-aaaahh!	[]
Announcer	1	0	Wow!	[]
Cartman	6	0	Thaat's right, suck on that.	[]
Mr. Garrison	8	0	Well, kids, how did you like the planetarium?	[]
Kyle	8	0	Oh, man, I don't feel so good.	[]
Stan	7	0	Me neither, but... I loved the planetarium.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Me too. It was sweet.	[]
Mr. Garrison	8	0	Really? What did you like best about it?	[]
Stan	11	0	I don't know. I don't even remember what happened.	[]
Mr. Garrison	6	0	Wait a minute. Where is Eric?	[]
Cartman	6	0	I did it! I did it!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Did what?	[]
Cartman	10	0	I got a call-back for the Cheesy Poofs song!	[]
Mr. Garrison	8	0	You snuck off and sang that stupid song?!	[]
Cartman	10	0	Yeah, dude, but I got in the finals for tomorrow!	[]
Dr. Adams	31	0	Goodbye, children. Thanks for visiting. Don't forget: we have Laser Rock shows at night here at the plane-'arium. This week it's Laser Kenny Loggins and Laser James Taylor.	[]
Kyle	5	0	My head still feels funny.	[]
Stan	3	0	Yeah, mine too.	[]
Cartman	23	0	Hey you guys, when I'm done with that- Cheesy Poofs commercial, I bet I get all the free Cheesy Poofs I want.	[]
Kyle	7	1	Like you really need it, hippo-ass!	['ass']
Cartman	11	0	It's sad how jealous you are, Kyle. It really is.	[]
Boy	1	0	Waaaah!	[]
"Stan, Kyle"	1	0	AAAAAH!	[]
Kyle	7	1	Whoa, dude! Who the hell are you?!	['hell']
Boy	6	0	My... name... is... vvan... G-gelder.	[]
Stan	24	1	Van Gelder?? What the hell are you doing on our bus?! Mr. Garrison, there's some freaky kid from the planetarium on our bus!	['hell']
Mr. Garrison	10	0	Oh, great! Well I guess we have to go back!	[]
Van Gelder	7	0	Nnno! Nn-don't go back! Nnno!	[]
Cartman	4	1	Hey, be careful, asshole!	['asshole']
Van Gelder	12	0	Eegh! Don't take me back there!  I can't... can't...	[]
Stan	5	0	Alright, dude. Mellow out, jeez!	[]
Van Gelder	1	0	Aaaagghh.	[]
Mr. Garrison	11	0	We've better get him to the nurse's office, stat!	[]
Van Gelder	4	0	Aagh! The planetarium! Haah!	[]
Nurse Gollum	12	0	I'll give him a pain killer. That should calm him down.	[]
Van Gelder	8	0	Nno! Nnno pain killer! I'll be okay!	[]
Mr. Mackey	4	0	Okay uh van Gelder-	[]
Van Gelder	1	0	Nnnaaaah!	[]
Mr. Mackey	15	2	-okay uh I'm Counselor Mackey. Have you been smokin' marijawana? Marijawana's bad, mkay?	['marijawana', 'marijawana']
Van Gelder	13	0	Eh must... tell... the machine. The machine is... e-e-e-ghe gheh-	[]
Mr. Mackey	13	0	Well, I've never seen anything like this. What do you think, principal?	[]
Principal Victoria	9	0	Well, whatever happened to him happened at the planetarium.	[]
Van Gelder	2	0	Haah! Planetarium!	[]
Principal Victoria	16	0	I think tonight the planetarium is doing Laser Loggins. I might have to check it out.	[]
Van Gelder	1	0	Nnaaah!	[]
Principal Victoria	5	0	Oh, man, this is boring!	[]
Man	8	0	Yeah, who the heck finds this stuff interesting?	[]
Teen 1	5	0	Dude, this is totally killer.	[]
Teen 2	10	0	I hope this goes on for like, seven months, man.	[]
Dr. Adams	19	0	You will not remember what happened here. To remember it will cause incredible pain.  Incredible pain!  Incredible icky paaiin!	[]
Teen 1	5	0	Dude, I'm totally tripping.	[]
Teen 2	4	0	This is totally killer.	[]
Mr. Garrison	41	0	Okay, children, today we're going to learn all about Japanese poems called haiku. A haiku is just like a normal American poem, except that it doesn't rhyme, and it's totally stupid. For example- Uh, where is Eric Cartman?	[]
Stan	4	0	That's a haiku?	[]
Mr. Garrison	11	0	No, I'm asking why Eric Cartman isn't at school.	[]
Stan	1	0	Oh.	[]
Mr. Garrison	8	0	Was he on the school bus this morning?	[]
Stan	1	0	No.	[]
Kyle	14	2	Fatass Cartman was not on the school bus today. What a big, fat turd.	['fat', 'turd']
Mr. Garrison	21	0	Hoh, very good haiku, Kyle. Yes- haikus have five syllables, then seven, then five. Kenny, can you give us another example?	[]
Kenny	16	1	(When you rub your dick, you might find a discharge that winds up on the floor.)	['dick']
Stan	5	0	Yeah. What's a discharge?	[]
Kyle	15	1	Mr. Garrison, since haiku sucks so much ass, could we go to the planetarium again?	['ass']
Stan	9	0	Yeah, I wanna go to the planetarium again, too.	[]
Mr. Garrison	13	0	But you were just there! Why do you wanna go again so soon?	[]
Stan	9	0	Yeah, why do we wanna go again so soon?	[]
Kyle	11	0	I dunno. I just have this sudden urge to go back.	[]
Mr. Garrison	14	0	Well, I guess we could go again, since it's just down the street.	[]
Cartman	13	0	Well, hello, it's all my little friends with all their little dreams.	[]
Mr. Garrison	5	0	Eric, where have you been?	[]
Cartman	11	0	Let's see, where have I been, where have I been?	[]
Stan	5	0	Where have you been, Cartman?	[]
Cartman	15	0	Wweell, I might have been over at the Cheesy Poofs call-back, winning regional championship!	[]
The Class	1	0	Whoa!	[]
Cartman	37	0	This is my regional championship certificate! Do you like it?  Hey, where is your regional champsionship 'tificate, Clyde? Oh, you don't have one?  Hmmm. Do you have a regional certificate, Wendy? Nno?  Apparently, only I do.	[]
Kyle	14	2	Ass full of pork fat jiggles like a Jello mold. Mouth is flapping, too.	['ass', 'fat']
Cartman	13	0	Your haiku insults have no effect on me, Kyle. I'm regional champion.	[]
Stan	12	0	Does that mean you're gonna be on that Cheesy Poofs commercial?	[]
Cartman	20	0	It's between me and four other kids. I'm on my way now with my mom to the finals.	[]
Kyle	16	2	I bet you don't win. They don't let big fat asses perform on TV.	['fat', 'asses']
Mr. Garrison	3	0	Very good, Kyle.	[]
Cartman	21	4	Shut your God-damned mouth or else I'm... gonna... kick you square in the balls... ass-hole Aw, damn it!	['damned', 'balls', 'ass', 'damn']
Mr. Mackey	6	0	Um. How's he doing, nurse?	[]
Nurse Gollum	20	0	He's stable, but I still can't get any information out of him. I'm gonna sedate him now.	[]
Van Gelder	3	1	Nno! No drugs.	['drugs']
Mr. Mackey	4	1	Drugs are good, mkay?	['drugs']
Van Gelder	8	0	Nno! Don't let them g-go... planetarium!	[]
Nurse Gollum	4	0	But why, van Gelder?	[]
Van Gelder	6	0	The machine. The machine is aaaah.	[]
Mr. Mackey	9	0	The machine is aaaah? Uh that's probably bad.	[]
Nurse Gollum	13	0	He's been talking about the machine for hours. That and Daisy Fuentes.	[]
Van Gelder	9	0	Wha- why in America's Funniest Home Videos? Why?	[]
Mr. Mackey	23	0	Uh, there's only one way to get any sense out of him. We're gonna have to try a mind meld, mkay?	[]
Nurse Gollum	2	0	A what?	[]
Mr. Mackey	28	0	Well, it's an ancient technique handed down from school counselor to school counselor. I don't like to use it, but it may be our only hope.	[]
Nurse Gollum	5	0	Well, what will you need?	[]
Mr. Mackey	8	0	Just time to prepare, nurse. Just time.  Mkay?	[]
Dr. Adams	12	0	Well, children, I'm so glad you came back to learn more.	[]
Mr. Garrison	16	0	They just begged to come back; I couldn't get them to shut up about it.	[]
Dr. Adams	16	0	Well, I'm sure we're going to have a marvelous time. Won't we, children?	[]
The Class	1	0	Yes.	[]
Teen 1	3	0	This way, please.	[]
Teen 2	3	0	Enjoy your visit.	[]
Dr. Adams	18	0	Billions of stars and billions of galaxies make up our universe. Here you see Polaris, the dog star.	[]
Mr. Garrison	9	0	I'm just gonna step outside and go weewee.	[]
Dr. Adams	62	0	Certainly, Mr. Garrison.  You love the planetarium! To be without the planetarium causes you horrible pain! All you want to do is help the planetarium thrive! To not do so makes your stomach ache with needlelike stab-  and right over here we see the constellation Orion.  Orion's belt is made up of three stars, one of which is actually a pulsar...	[]
Stan	4	0	Dude, what just happened?	[]
Kyle	4	0	What do you mean?	[]
Stan	13	0	Come on, we've gotta get out of here before something bad happens.	[]
Liane	6	0	Don't pick your nose, hon.	[]
Cartman	13	0	I wasn't picking it-I had an itch, for cryin' out loud!	[]
Liane	10	0	Don't be nervous. I'm sure you'll win.	[]
Cartman	11	0	I don't know. There's a lot of competition here.	[]
Poor Girl	7	0	Do you think I might win, Mommy?	[]
Poor Mom	13	0	I hope so, honey. Then perhaps we can eat for a little while.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Hey, look! They're giving away bread outside!	[]
Poor Girl	5	0	Did you hear that, Mommy?	[]
Poor Mom	11	0	Come on! Perhaps we can get some food in our stomachs!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Psych!	[]
Mr. Garrison	14	1	What the hell are you boys doing? You're supposed to be in there.	['hell']
Stan	9	0	Mr. Garrison, we think that the planetarium guy is-	[]
Kyle	1	0	Sshh!	[]
Dr. Adams	5	0	Goodbye, children. Thanks for coming.	[]
Clyde	8	0	I wanna go again. I wanna go again!	[]
Mr. Garrison	9	0	Oh, for Pete's sake, Clyde. You just went!	[]
Dr. Adams	20	0	Well, Clyde, if you like the plane'arium so much, perhaps you'd like to do some volunteer work here.	[]
Clyde	3	0	Yes. Yes, please!	[]
Butters	2	0	Me, too!	[]
Annie	12	0	Me, too! I wanna do it! I'd love to work here.	[]
A Girl	7	0	I'd like to tape the show!	[]
Fosse	6	0	Yeah, me tohohoo. Plahanehetaharium's gahahay!	[]
Dr. Adams	2	0	Mr. Garrison?	[]
Mr. Garrison	11	0	Well, I guess I could give them extra credit for it.	[]
Dr. Adams	18	0	Excellent! Why don't we step over here and I'll show all you children how to volunteer.	[]
The Class	1	0	Hooray!	[]
Stan	5	0	Dude, this isn't right.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Why?	[]
Stan	10	0	We're kids, dude. We don't volunteer for anything.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Oh, yeah.	[]
Stan	12	0	Come on, we've gotta see what's going on in there.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Here's the control panel that operates all the stars.	[]
Stan	11	0	Kenny, you go out there and tell us what you see.	[]
Kenny	6	0	(Okay. Got to have some huggin'.)	[]
Stan	4	0	He hits this switch-	[]
Kenny	5	0	(I don't see anything.)	[]
Kyle	9	0	You see? Nothing, dude. Just a bunch of stars.	[]
Stan	4	0	Yeah, I guess so.	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Whoa, dude.)	[]
Kyle	4	0	What does that do?	[]
Stan	4	0	I don't know.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Kenny! What's it doing?	[]
Stan	10	0	This says maximum.  Oh my God, we've killed Kenny!	[]
Kyle	3	1	We're bastards!	['bastards']
Stan	10	0	Dude, I told you something was up with this place!	[]
Kyle	7	0	We've gotta go tell somebody, quick!	[]
Boy	75	0	(clap clap clap) -G-O (clap clap ---) -G-O and Bingo was his name-o Was a farmer'o had a dog and Bingo was his name-o (clap clap clap-clap) O (clap clap clap-clap clap) O (clap clap clap-clap clap) O and Bingo was his name-o Was a farmer'o had a dog and Bingo was his name-o (clap) ING (clap) ING (clap) and Bingo was his name-o	[]
Center Judge	18	0	Thank you... uh, Peter. We'll let you know very soon.  Next will be uuh, Eric Theodore Cartman.	[]
Liane	10	0	Hello, everybody.  Now, just do it like we rehearsed, hon.	[]
Cartman	52	0	I know, I know!  She works hard for the money So hard for it, honey She works hard for the money, so you'd better treat her right She works hard for the money So hard for it, honey She works hard for the money, so you'd better treat her right	[]
Center Judge	7	0	Well, Heric Cartman, that certainly was... insane.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Thank you.	[]
Center Judge	5	0	We'll let you know.	[]
Liane	8	0	Thank you.  Don't pick your nose, hon.	[]
Cartman	13	1	I'm not pickin' it ma! God damn it, I have an itch!	['damn']
Center Judge	7	0	Jesus, where do we find these people?!	[]
Mr. Mackey	10	0	Our minds are one. Mkay? Our thoughts are one. Mkay?	[]
Nurse Gollum	9	0	This is the strangest thing I've ever seen!	[]
Mr. Mackey	28	0	Please, nurse, for a woman with a dead fetus on your head, you're not being very open-minded.  Open your mind to your counselor. Open your mind.	[]
Van Gelder	2	0	Dr. Adams.	[]
Mr. Mackey	1	0	Yes.	[]
Nurse Gollum	7	0	He owns the planetarium. What about him?	[]
"Van Gelder, Mr. Mackey"	7	0	He uses the machine. The star machine.	[]
Mr. Mackey	1	0	Mkay?	[]
"Van Gelder, Mr. Mackey"	6	0	He uses it to erase minds.	[]
Nurse Gollum	2	0	But why?	[]
"Van Gelder, Mr. Mackey"	14	0	Planetarium, about to go out of business. Adams had to create slaves to survive.	[]
Nurse Gollum	5	0	My God! This is amazing!	[]
Mr. Mackey	10	0	Abuh. Please, nurse, you're throwin' off my chi! Mkay?	[]
Center Judge	27	0	Well, we'd certainly like to thank all our finalists. Only one of our finalists can win the grand prize and... unfortunately, that finalist is Eric Cartman.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Yes! I'm the best!	[]
Center Judge	19	0	You were actually our last choice. Uh the other children have unexpectedly taken jobs as volunteers at the planetarium.	[]
Blonde Judge	3	0	That's odd.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Sweeet!	[]
Tom	37	0	It appears that more and more South Park residents are discovering the wonder and joy of the planetarium. Here with a special report is a 34-year old Asian man who looks strikingly similar to Ricardo Montalban.	[]
Asian Reporter	34	0	Thanks, Tom. Yes, indeed, the planetarium has become very popular as word spreads that it really isn't as lame and stupid as one suspected. I'm here with the planetarium operator, Dr. Adams.	[]
Dr. Adams	37	0	Thank you. I'd like to open an invitation to all South Park residents to come see a special free show this evening. I guarantee, it will change the way you think about the plane'ah-arium	[]
Asian Reporter	16	0	So, bring the whole family to the plane-tarium for a night of excitement and wonder.	[]
Stan	14	0	...and then we turned the dial, and Kenny went into a kind of hypnosis.	[]
Officer Barbrady	8	0	That's a pretty far-fetched story, boys.	[]
Kyle	5	0	But it's true, dude!	[]
Officer Barbrady	12	0	Are you boys sure you're not just making this all up?	[]
Stan	3	0	Yeah, pretty sure.	[]
Officer Barbrady	31	0	Well, just as soon as I handle all the other crime in South Park, I'm gonna go with you to the planetarium so I can prove that nothing's wrong.	[]
Stan	6	0	What other crime in South Park?	[]
Officer Barbrady	5	0	Oh, yeah. Let's go.	[]
Director	12	0	Okay. Let's shoot the commercial. Where's our Cheesy Poof talent?	[]
Cartman	4	0	I'm over here.	[]
Liane	10	1	Oohh, you look great, hon. Mommy's fat little piggy.	['fat']
Cartman	8	0	Aay!  Let's hurry. This costume is hot.	[]
Director	5	0	Okay, roll camera, aaand action.	[]
Cartman	5	0	I love Cheesy Poofs, you-	[]
Liane	11	0	Oh wait, wait.  You've got a little eye booger, hon.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Oh, Mom, for Pete's sake!	[]
Liane	2	0	Got it.	[]
Director	2	0	Aaand action.	[]
Cartman	4	0	I love Cheesy Poofs-	[]
Director	12	0	Hold it! Cut! Could we get some more light on that backdrop?	[]
Stagehand	2	0	Sure thing.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Oh, man, c'mon!	[]
Stagehand	2	0	Got it.	[]
Director	6	0	Okay. Here we go, aaand action.	[]
Cartman	7	0	I love Cheesy Poofs, you love Chee-	[]
Director	1	0	Cut!	[]
Cartman	1	0	What?!	[]
Director	11	0	I'm not liking the shoes. Could we change the shoes?	[]
Cartman	3	1	Oh, God damnit!	['damnit']
Dr. Adams	6	0	Oh. Hello, officer of the law.	[]
Officer Barbrady	4	0	Hello, Mr. Planetarium Operator.	[]
Dr. Adams	5	0	What brings you out here?	[]
Officer Barbrady	28	0	Well, these boys seem to think you're some kind of sick weirdo that's got a master plan to screw with the minds of everyone in town.	[]
Dr. Adams	2	0	Oh, really?	[]
Officer Barbrady	21	0	Yeah. I just thought I'd come show them around so they'd know there's nothing to be scared of.	[]
Dr. Adams	7	0	Actually, this is a pretty inopportune time.	[]
Officer Barbrady	6	0	Okay, I'll be quick, then.	[]
Dr. Adams	6	0	Of course, officer. Come on in.	[]
Chef	2	0	Hello, children.	[]
Stan	6	0	Oh, no! They got Chef, too!	[]
Chef	4	0	Welcome to the planetarium.	[]

Chef	4	0	I love my work.	[]
Officer Barbrady	13	0	Oh I know what you mean. I've always loved the planetarium, too.	[]
Dr. Adams	8	0	Would you like to see the stars, officer?	[]
"Stan, Kyle"	1	0	No!	[]
Officer Barbrady	5	0	That would be super-duper!	[]
Kyle	6	0	Don't do it, Officer Barbrady!	[]
An Aged Voice	1	0	Hello?	[]
