Cartman	2	1	God dammit!	['dammit']
Randy	4	0	Stan, are you okay?	[]
Stan	8	0	Yeah, dad. We're just rehearsing our band.	[]
Randy	17	0	Ooohhh, I thought a group of Vietnamese people were having their intestines pulled out through their mouths.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Heheheheheh heheheheheh.	[]
Kyle	36	0	He's right, dude. We have to define our style if we're ever going to make a platinum album. I mean, ah I'm a fusion guy, but Kenny's background is more Latin Jazz.	[]
Kenny	3	0	(What? Is it?)	[]
Stan	12	0	Yeah, and I'm more hip-hop and R-and-B oriented.	[]
Kyle	17	0	I think out band better buy a whole bunch of music CDs to listen to for inspiration.	[]
Cartman	14	0	Inspiration. Wait a minute,  that's it. Inspiration, you guys. Don't you see?	[]
Stan	2	0	See what?	[]
Cartamn	6	0	Our band should play Christian rock!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Christian rock?!	[]
Cartman	31	2	Think about it! It's the easiest crappiest music in the world, right? If we just play songs about how much we love Jesus, all the Christians will buy our crap!	['crappiest', 'crap']
Kyle	6	1	That's a retarded idea, Cartman!	['retarded']
Cartman	4	0	It worked for Creed!	[]
Stan	11	0	I don't wanna be in a stupid Christian rock band!	[]
Cartman	13	0	You just start that way, Stan, then you cross over. It's genius!	[]
Kyle	20	1	Just get the hell out of here, Cartman! You're not serious and you're a detriment to the band!	['hell']
Cartman	27	0	Oh yeah?! I will bet you ten bucks that if I start a Christian rock band that I can get a platinum album before you guys do!	[]
Kyle	5	1	You're on, fat boy!	['fat']
Cartman	12	0	Okay, fine! Ready?! First one to have a platinum album wins! Go!	[]
Kyle	4	1	What a stupid asshole!	['asshole']
Cartman	11	0	Platinum album! Platinum album! Gotta make a platinum album before Kyle!	[]
Butters	3	0	Oh, hi Eric.	[]
Cartman	20	0	Butters! Get your drum set and meet me at my house! We have to make a platinum album! Hurry, Butters!	[]
Butters	1	0	...Ohhh!	[]
Cartman	25	1	No time to waste! Platinum album! Must beat Kyle!  Token! Get the bass guitar out of your basement and meet me over at my house!	['basement']
Token	8	0	What?! We don't have a bass guitar.	[]
Cartman	17	1	Your family's black, Token! There's bound to be a bass guitar in your basement somewhere!	['basement']
Butters	13	0	Whoa, you sure seem with it, Eric. You must have some... ih-inspiration.	[]
Cartman	14	0	Yes, the tears of Kyle Broflovski when he loses his ten dollars to me.	[]
Token	9	1	Hey, there was a bass guitar in my basement.	['basement']
Cartman	4	0	I told you, Token.	[]
Token	5	0	So, what are we doing?	[]
Cartman	19	0	Gentlemen, we are about to embark on the most amazing, life-affirming, financially windfalling experiences of our young lives.	[]
Butters	1	0	Wow!	[]
Cartman	9	0	We are going to start... a Christian rock band.	[]
Butters	1	0	Awww.	[]
Token	3	0	I'm out.	[]
Cartman	51	0	Wait!  Walk out that door, Token, and you'll regret it the rest of your life! Christians have a built-in audience of over one hundred and eighty million Americans! If each one of them buys just one of our albums at twelve dollars and ninety-five cents that would be-	[]
Butters	9	0	Two billion, three hundred and thirty one million dollars.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Still want to leave, Token?  Thank you.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Dad, can I borrow three hundred dollars?	[]
Gerald	8	0	Three hundred dollars?? What in the world for??	[]
Kyle	33	0	Our band can't find a stylistic direction to go in. We need to go down to the mall to buy hundreds of CDs to listen to so we can define our sound.	[]
Gerald	8	0	Sorry Kyle, we gave you your allowance already.	[]
Kyle	13	0	Ugh. Can't you see this is my dream?? Music is my life!	[]
Gerald	6	0	It wasn't your life yesterday.	[]
Kyle	40	0	Hold it.  Pops, I've got the music inside me. It's in my soul. And I know my place is up on that stage. I'm gonna make it to the top. And I just want your blessing, Pops.	[]
Gerald	5	0	The answer is no, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	10	1	Aw, come on Dad, don't be such a Jew!	['jew']
Sheila	7	0	Kyle, don't belittle your own people!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Aaaargh!	[]
Stan	2	0	Hey dude.	[]
Kyle	15	1	It didn't work! My stupid Jew dad won't lend me money for CDs!	['jew']
Stan	16	0	No, dude, it's cool. Kenny says you can download music for free on the Internet!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Really?	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Yeah!)	[]
Stan	4	0	You got a computer?	[]
Stan	25	0	See? Everyone on the Internet copies their music from their CDs, and then we can download them for free and play them on the computer!	[]
Kyle	12	0	All right, cool.  Let's download some Metallica, and some Stevie Wonder.	[]
Kenny	8	0	(Oh you forgot to get some Judas Priest.)	[]
Stan	10	0	Kenny's right. We should download some Judas Priest, too.	[]
Kyle	9	0	Judas Priest.  Wow! Downloading music for free is awesome!	[]
Stan	5	1	What the hell is that?	['hell']
Kyle	8	0	I don't know.  Let me go check.	[]
Agent 1	2	0	Freeze!! FBI!!	[]
Agent 2	8	0	Down on the ground! Down on the ground!	[]
Agent 3	7	0	Hurry up! Let me see those hands!	[]
Agent 2	8	0	Tango Teamus to Point Bravo! Suspects in custody!	[]
Agent 4	13	1	Move move move move move move! All clear, men!  Get your ass going!	['ass']
Agent 5	7	0	Move move move move move move! Move!	[]
Gerald	5	0	Kyle, what did you do?!	[]
Kyle	4	0	I don't know!	[]
Cartman	68	0	All right, guys, this is gonna be so easy. All we have to do to make Christian songs is take regular old songs and add Jesus stuff to them.  See? All we have to do is cross out words like baby and Darling and replace them with  Jesus. All right, Butters, give me a beat.  Okay, nice. Very nice. All right, Token, give me a smooth bass line.	[]
Token	8	0	I don't know how to play bass.	[]
Cartman	18	0	Token, how many times do we have to go through this? You're black. You can play bass.	[]
Token	7	0	I'm gettin' sick of your stereotypes!	[]
Cartman	14	1	Be as sick as you want, just give me a God-damned bass line!	['damned']
Token	2	1	God-damnit!	['damnit']
Cartman	30	0	All right. Nice, fellas. Nice.  I need you in my life, Jesus. I can't live without you, Jesus And I just want to feel you deep inside me, Jesus.	[]
Butters	2	0	Well done!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Um, sir-	[]
Detective	31	0	Shiut up!!  You downloaded a lot of songs! Says here you even downlaoded Judas Priest? That's hard time you boys are lookin' at. You got anything to say for yourselves?	[]
Kyle	11	0	We d-didn't think it was that big a deal.	[]
Detective	35	0	Not a big deal! You think downloading music for free is not a big deal?! Put your couts on! I'm gonna show you something! And I don't think you're gonna like it!	[]
Detective	20	0	This is the home of Lars Ulrich, the drummer for Metallica.  Look. There's Lars now, sitting by his pool.	[]
Kyle	6	0	What's the matter with him?	[]
Detective	108	0	This month he was hoping to have a gold-plated shark tank bar installed right next to the pool, but thanks to people downloading his music for free, he must now wait a few months before he can afford it.  Come. There's more.  Here's Britney Spears' private jet. Notice anything?  Britney used to have a Gulfstream IV. Now she's had to sell it and get a Gulfstream III because people like you chose to download her music for free.  The Gulfstream III doesn't even have a remote control for its surround-sound DVD system. Still think downloading music for free is no big deal?	[]
Kyle	9	0	We... didn't realize what we were doing, eh...	[]
Detective	39	0	That is the folly of man. Now look in this window.  Here you see the loving family of Master P.  Next week is his son's birthday and, all he's ever wanted was an island in French Polynesia.	[]
Kyle	7	0	So, he's gonna get it, right?	[]
Detective	23	0	I see an island without an owner. If things keep going the way they are, the child will not get his tropical paradise.	[]
Stan	13	0	We're sorry! We'll, we'll never download music for free again!	[]
Detective	30	0	Man must learn to think of these horrible outcomes before he acts selfishly or else... I fear... recording artists will be forever doomed to a life of only semi-luxury.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Almost there, you guys.	[]
Butters	1	0	Ow...	[]
Token	15	1	Why the hell did you tell us to dress nice to take us out here?	['hell']
Cartman	25	0	Because, Token, we have to take pictures for our album cover.  The key to a hot-selling Christian album is a flashy inspirational album cover.	[]
Butters	5	0	Wow, neato! An album cover!	[]
Token	14	0	This Christian album better make as much money as you said it would, tubby!	[]
Cartman	9	0	I'm going to kill you one day, Token.	[]
Token	4	0	What did you say?!	[]
Cartman	27	0	Nothing. All right, guys, stand over there and look wholesome and cool. I have a timer on this thing so I can get in the shot too.	[]
Butters	1	0	Cheese!	[]
Cartman	27	0	No no! Haven't you guys ever seen an album cover? You're supposed to be standing in random places, looking away like you don't care!	[]
Butters	1	0	Cheese!	[]
Cartman	15	0	No! Butters, you can't look happy on the album cover! That's not cool!	[]
Butters	1	0	Oh...	[]
Cartman	8	0	Token, look away to the right.  More.  More!	[]
Token	10	1	Why the hell would I be looking way over there??	['hell']
Cartman	82	1	So it looks like you're too cool to care that you're on an album cover, you black asshole! Now just hold it!  Our first album cover.  Don't ever leave me, Jesus. I couldn't stand to see you go. My heart would simply snap, my Lord, if you walked on out that door. I promise I'll be good to you, and keep you warm at night. Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, why don't we just... shut off the lights.	['asshole']
Gerald	14	0	Thanks for releasing them to us, detective. Sorry for all the trouble they caused.	[]
Detective	11	0	It's all right. I think these boys learned their lesson.	[]
Stan	4	0	Boy, I'll say!	[]
Detective	19	0	If you parents will just step over here, you can pay their four hundred dollar release and penalty fees.	[]
Randy	18	0	Four hundred dollars? Just for downloading some songs off the Internet? It's not that big a deal.	[]
Detective	24	0	Not a big deal, huh?! Come with me! I'm gonna show you something! And I don't think you're gonna like it!	[]
Stan	17	0	Wugh, dude. I can't wait to just go back home and get back to band practice.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Yeah)	[]
Kyle	37	0	No! Didn't you guys learn anything? Look, if we make an album, all that's gonna happen is that people are gonna steal our songs for free off the Internet. We won't make a dime!	[]
Stan	2	0	Oh yeah.	[]
Kyle	16	0	Until we get people to stop downloading music for free, I say we refuse to play!	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Yeah!)	[]
Field Reporter	28	0	Tom, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado, where the rock band, MOOP, has refused to play. The strike started yesterday and could go well into next week.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Oh hey guys. How's it going?	[]
Kyle	12	1	We're not letting you back in the band, Cartman! Fuck off!	['fuck']
Cartman	31	1	I don't wanna be in your crappy band, guys. I just wanted to let you know, the album for my Christian rock band,  Faith + 1, is about to go platinum.	['crappy']
Stan	2	0	It is??	[]
Cartman	23	0	That's right. We already sold thirteen copies. You wanna pay me that ten-dollar bet, Kyle? Nyanyanyanya nya nya!  Hahahaha ha ha!	[]
Kyle	13	2	You get a platinum album for selling one million copies, you fat turd!	['fat', 'turd']
Cartman	41	0	It's just a matter of time, my friends. This weekend is Christfest. The single largest gathering of Christians in the Midwest. Each one of them a walking, praying wallet full of cash. And I'll be there selling my album.	[]
Kyle	24	0	You'll never get a platinum album doing Christian rock, Cartman! It was a stupid idea then, and it's a stupid idea now!	[]
Stan	9	0	Yeah, you don't even know anything about Christianity.	[]
Cartman	15	0	I know enough to exploit it. Just get that ten bucks ready, Kyle. Ta-ta!	[]
Kyle	14	0	Go ahead! People will just download your songs for free on the Internet anyways!	[]
Stan	10	1	What a dumbass. Our band is way cooler than his.	['dumbass']
Kenny	1	0	(Yeah.)	[]
T-Shirt Vendor	11	0	Psalm T-Shirts! Get a T-Shirt with your favorite psalm!	[]
Bible Vendor	6	0	Leather-bound bibles. Show your faith.	[]
Cartman	14	0	Yes, it's really the best Christian album that's ever been produced, actually..	[]
Elderly Woman	17	0	Oh, this will be great for my grandchildren. They need hip cool music, but with inspirational lyrics.	[]
Cartman	11	0	I think that's what the whole world needs, praise Christ.	[]
Butters	12	0	Huh we're not really Christians, we're just pretendin' we are.	[]
Cartman	9	1	Butters, remind me later to cut your balls off.	['balls']
MC	14	0	All right, everyone! Welcome to Christfest 2003!  are you ready for some live music?	[]
A Man	2	0	Yeah Jesus!	[]
MC	16	0	Then let's give it up now for one of Christian rock's biggest bands! Trinity!	[]
Trinity	20	0	The Shepherd and the Light, and His Word lifted me up And I praise His Holy Name wherever I go.	[]
Cartman	18	1	Dammit! If we're gonna sell our hot Christian album, we have got to get on that stage!	['dammit']
Band Member 1	8	0	Hey is this the way to the backstage?	[]
Cartman	3	0	Who are you?	[]
Band Member 1	18	0	We're the band Sanctified. We play metal and punk, but with lyrics that inspire faith in Christ.	[]
Band Member 2	12	0	Yeah. We proved that Christian music can be tough and hard core.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Yeah, you guys are real hard core.	[]
Band Member 1	9	0	You bet your gosh-darned rear end we are!	[]
Stage Hand	9	0	All right, uhh, Sanctified, you guys are up next.	[]
Band Member 3	5	0	Yeah! Let's do it!	[]
Band Member 2	9	0	Sent down from Heaven! The Spirit and the Glory!	[]
Cartman	14	0	Eh hey guys, wait, uh, ..we wannaaa play with you before you go onstage.	[]
Band Member 2	5	0	Well, that, that's cool.	[]
Band Member 1	9	0	Always good to be praying before you're playin'.	[]
Cartman	25	0	Let's just go over here so we can hear ourselves better.  Lord, Father in Heaven, we thank you for all your blessings and we...	[]
Butters	10	0	Hey, Eric, I don't think they can get out.	[]
MC	8	0	All right, Christians, how are you feeling tonight?	[]
Fans	6	0	Praise Jesus! Praise him! My Lord!	[]
MC	12	0	Let's keep this salvation train going with the hot band, Sanctified!	[]
Stage Hand	4	0	That's Faith + 1.	[]
MC	14	0	Uh. Uh apparently there's been a change. Give it up for ... Faith + 1!	[]
Cartman	119	0	You know, Jesus? I've been thinking a lot about you lately and, well, that's why I wrote this song. I love you, Jesus. I want you to walk with me I'll take good care of you baby. Call you my baby, baby! You died for my sins, and you know that I would die for you, right? What's the matter, baby? You tremble at Jesus, baby! Your love... is my life! You know when I'm without you, there's a black hole in my life! Oo-ohhh! I wanna believe. It's all right, 'cause I get lonely in the night and it's up to you to Save me! Jee...sus...bay-by!	[]
Stan	14	0	Dude, I didn't know being in a band was gonna be this tough.	[]
Kyle	29	0	Yeah, it's tough. But it's times like these that... you see what your band is made of. We've gotta fight through the rough times like Journey!	[]
Field Reporter	73	1	Tom, we're now entering the second day of the rock band MOOP's refusal to play, and the second day of absolutely no other news to report on. In a recent poll we asked people if MOOP's refusal to play would stop them from downloading music off the Internet. One percent said yes. Two percent said no. And ninety-seven percent said, Who the hell is MOOP?! Back to you, Tom.	['hell']
Lars Ulrich	10	0	Hey, are you the guys protesting free Internet music downloading?	[]
Stan	7	0	Hey, it's that Lars Ulrich guy!	[]
Lars Ulrich	11	0	That's right. Metallica is behind you dudes a thousand percent!	[]
James Hetfield	14	0	We're gonna sit here and protest with you until free downloadin' stop, hyeah!	[]
Field Reporter	44	0	Tom, it appears now the musicians' strike is growing! As I'm speaking, more musicians are arriving! It looks like Alanis Morissette, Blink 182, Britney Spears, and dozens of others are going to join MOOP in not playing music. This is a veritable Strikapalooza!	[]
CEO	28	0	Guys, we here at Faith Records were very moved by your performance at Christfest. You're one of the most talented Christian rock bands we've ever heard!	[]
Cartman	11	0	Thank you so much. Christ has really blessed us with talent.	[]
Butters	1	0	Heeheeheeyeah.	[]
Executive 1	52	0	We just have one question, though. We were looking over some of your lyrics, uh... I want to walk hand-in-hand with Jesus on a private beach for two./I want him to nibble on my ear and say 'I'm here for you.' Ih...it seems you really love Christ.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Yes, we sure do.	[]
Executive 1	13	0	Eh no but ih it appears you are actually... in love with Christ.	[]
Cartman	13	0	Well what are you saying? That, that you don't really love Christ??	[]
Executive 1	10	0	Well uh of course I do. I mean I just-	[]
Cartman	22	0	Well what's the difference?! You love Christ, you're in love with Christ, I mean, uh, what the heck is this??	[]
Executive 1	22	0	Uh, we'd just like to make sure the bands we sign are in it for God, and not for the money.	[]
Cartman	28	0	I resent that, sir! I have never in my life done anything just for the money! If I'm lying may the Lord strike me down right now.	[]
Butters	2	0	Uhm, oh.	[]
Executive 1	17	0	That's- all we needed to know. Just, sign here and we'll get your album sold.	[]
Announcer	24	0	K-tal Records  presents the most inspirational Christian rock band in the world! Faith + 1,  featuring the very best in good, wholesome Christian music.	[]
Cartman	17	0	Oh Lord you are my Savior! You know I miss you so much when you are gone.	[]
Announcer	11	0	With great inspirational songs like I Wasn't Born Again Yesterday,	[]
Cartman	34	0	Yes I may be born again, but I was wasn't born again yesterday. I wanna get down on my knees and start pleasing Jesus! I wanna feel his salvation all over my face!	[]
Announcer	11	0	The CD is filled with instant classics. Who doesn't remember...	[]
Cartman	57	0	The Body of Christ! Sleek swimmer's body, all muscled up and toned! The Body of Christ! O, Lord Almighty, I wish I could call it my own! You're one time, two times, three times my Savior... Whenever I see Jesus up on that Cross I can't help but think that he looks kinda hot...	[]
Announcer	15	0	This album is not available in stores and limited quantities are available, so order now!	[]
Stan	19	0	I can't take this much longer. Maybe we're just, not cut out to be in a band.	[]
Kyle	25	0	You guys, we can't give up on our dreams now! As soon as this strike ends, we're gonna be the biggest band ever!	[]
Lars	16	0	Yeah, if we all give in now, people might never stop downloading our music for free!	[]
Kyle	16	0	I'm sure we're gonna get word any minute that people have agreed to stop.	[]
Driver	7	0	Certified letter for the rock band MOOP?	[]
Kyle	24	0	That's us!  Dear MOOP. This letter is to inform you that Faith Plus One's debut album has just sold one million copies.	[]
Stan	1	0	What??	[]
Kyle	41	0	We cordially invite you to attend the platinum album award ceremony, which will be held tomorrow morning at ten. Details and proof of sales enclosed. P.S. Nananana na na. Hahahaha ha ha.  He did it. Cartman got a platinum album.	[]
Stan	8	0	Is this for real?? This is for real!	[]
Kyle	25	0	He beat us. Because all this time we've been so caught up with how to protect our music that we forgot to just play.	[]
Lars	12	0	But why play if we're not gonna make millions of dollars.	[]
Kyle	42	0	Because that's what real artists do. People are always gonna find a way to copy our music and swap it for free. If we're real musicians, then we should just play and be stoked that so many people are listening.	[]
Stan	29	0	Beside, maybe our sound would have gotten downloaded for free, but if they were good songs then people still would have bought tickets to see our band in concert.	[]
Kyle	21	0	From now on, MOOP isn't about money. MOOP is about music! We're not striking anymore! Who's with us?!	[]
Britney	6	0	...We're just about the money.	[]
Other acts	2	0	Yeah, yeah.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Oh.	[]
Stan	17	0	So... Dude, what are you gonna do about your bet with Cartman. Are you- gonna pay 'im?	[]
Kyle	42	0	I don't have a choice, dude. I'm gonna swallow my pride, face Cartman, and say Congratulations. You were right And I'm gonna give him the ten dollars. And hopefully, he won't make a big deal out of it.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Welcome! Welcome everyone! Please enjoy! The presentation should begin shortly.	[]
Token	7	1	Cartman, what the hell is all this?	['hell']
Cartman	8	0	Our platinum album ceremony. I spared no expense.	[]
Token	8	0	But you spent all the money we made!	[]
Cartman	37	1	We're Faith Plus One, Token, there'll be plenty more money. Relax and enjoy, black asshole.  There's hors d'oeuvres and drinks by the Ferris wheel, everyone!  Oh Kyle, guys, so nice to see you!	['asshole']
Kyle	16	0	Let's just get this over with, Cartman. You won the bet, here's ten dollars.	[]
Cartman	15	0	Oh nonononono, not yet, Kyle. Hold on.  Everyone! Everyone, can I have your attention please?	[]
A Fan	5	0	We like to praise Christ!	[]
Cartman	16	0	Yes, yes, thank you thank you. Praise Him. I think we're ready to start now.	[]
Announcer	19	0	Welcome to the presentation ceremony for Faith Plus One.  And now to present the award, here's Michael Collins.	[]
Kyle	8	0	This is the worst day of my life.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Ahhh, this is the best day of my life.	[]
Michael Collins	22	0	Boys, in recognition for over one million records sold, the Christian Recording Industry is please to present you with this Myrrh album.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Thank you very uh- wah? Myrrh album?	[]
Stan	8	0	I thought albums win either gold or platinum.	[]
Michael Collins	13	0	Nono, in Christian rock, our albums go gold and frankincense and myrrh. Congratulations!	[]
Kyle	23	1	Ha! Our bet was that you would get a platinum album, not a myrrh album! I don't owe you anything, fat boy!	['fat']
Cartman	17	0	You mean to tell me I could never get a platinum album with a Christian rock band?!	[]
Michael Collins	7	0	No, but you can go double myrrh.	[]
Cartman	2	1	GOD DAMMIT!!	['dammit']
Michael Collins	11	0	Oh, please don't take the Lord's Name in vain.	[]
Cartman	18	1	Who cares?! I can never win my bet because you stupid assholes don't give out platinum albums!	['assholes']
Michael Collins	14	0	But you spread the Word of the Lord. You've brought faith in Jesus.	[]
Cartman	3	1	OH, FUCK JESUS!!	['fuck']
Butters	16	0	Eric, I-I'm pretty sure you shouldn't say the F-word about-uh Jesus.	[]
Token	7	0	Yeah. You're gonna hurt the band.	[]
Cartman	17	2	Who fuckin' cares, Token?! I could never beat Kyle now! I'll say it again! Fuck Jesus!	['fuckin', 'fuck']
A Man	4	0	My ears are bleeding!	[]
Token	8	1	Good job, dickhead! You lost the entire audience!	['dickhead']
Cartman	7	2	Ah, fuck you, Token! You black asshole!	['fuck', 'asshole']
Stan	7	0	Hm. Guess he got what he deserved.	[]
Butters	3	1	Fuck you, Eric.	['fuck']
