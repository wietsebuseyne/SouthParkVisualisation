Announcer	22	0	This is closed-circuit television for South Park Elementary School. And now, Super School News. The news made for students, by students.	[]
Jimmy	10	0	Welcome to S-super School News. I'm Jimmy Valmer.	[]
Cartman	5	0	And I'm Rick Cartman.	[]
Jimmy	29	0	The price of milk money will go up next Monday to 49 cents. The school claims the added money is due to the cow shortage in South Park County.	[]
Cartman	44	0	Parent-teacher conferences will be held this Wednesday night, from seven to nine. So kids, get a lot of playing in before you get grounded. And now, for a look at what's on the menu for school lunch today, here's Stan Marsh.	[]
Stan	62	0	Eric, it looks as though the school will be serving a chicken cutlet. Now, that's traditionally a uh-a white meat chicken... breast, if you will, that has been breaded, and then cooked. I've been told there will also be tater-tots and a vegetable dish. This is really shaping up to be a ah-ah one fantastic lunch. Eric?	[]
Cartman	21	0	...Hard-hitting reporting, Stan. Thanks a lot. And now, here with the celebrity watch is Butters Stotch. Butters, seen any celebrities?	[]
Butters	51	0	Nu-noo, not yet. I've been standin' out in front of the school for about ...two hours now and ah, and I haven't seen any celebrities. Uh, about thirty minutes ago I thought I saw Sigourney Weaver, but ih-ih-turn- it turns out it was a dead horse.	[]
Cartman	7	0	All right, Butters, keep your eyes open.	[]
Butters	2	0	Will do.	[]
Jimmy	15	0	More snow for South P... P-P-Park. Here's Token Black with the weather.	[]
Token	36	0	Jimmy and Eric, it looks like a massive snow storm is headed South Park's way. I asked my dad last night and he said that he heard the snow storm is expected on Tuesday. Guys?	[]
Cartman	22	0	Kyle Broflovski now joins us for a look at sports. And Kyle, the girls' basketball team just can't get it right.	[]
Kyle	48	0	Another devastating loss for the Cows last night, Eric. They were ahead in the game until Kelly Anderson started crying because she missed her daddy, who's on a business trip in Thailand. Uh, Kelly was so upset she couldn't play, and the Cows had to forfeit.	[]
Cartman	17	0	Cows are on a six and O slide since Kelly's father left for that business trip.	[]
Jimmy	21	0	And that's all for Super School News. Enjoy your day at South Park Eh-Eh-Eh-Eh- > Ehehehehe  Eh-Elementary. />	[]
Stan	4	0	And we're... cut! >> />/>	[]
Cartman	6	0	All right, nice reporting, guys. Nice.	[]
Butters	6	0	Boy, that was a great episode!	[]
Stan	11	0	Yeah, I think that was one of our best shows yet.	[]
Mr. Meryl	16	0	Boys, I'm afraid I have some bad news. The school has to cancel your show.	[]
Kyle	1	0	What?!	[]
Jimmy	9	0	For God's sake,why Mr. M-M-Meryl?!	[]
Mr. Meryl	17	0	Well, the students just aren't watching ya. Your rating was only a four this whole week.	[]
Cartman	5	0	How many students is that?	[]
Mr. Meryl	15	0	Four.  Four students watch your show. And meanwhile, Craig's show is getting a 57!	[]
Stan	3	0	...Craig's show??	[]
Cartman	6	1	What is that butthole doing now?!	['butthole']
Mr. Meryl	20	0	O-hoh, it's brilliant! It's all just video footage of animals close-up with a wide angle lens.	[]
Craig	8	0	Animals Close-Up With A Wide Angle Lens.	[]
Stan	11	1	But that's... that's crap! That's not even TV!	['crap']
Mr. Meryl	29	0	It's what the students want, and it's cheaper to make than your show. Just one person and a video camera. Craig is a genius. Uh-sorry, kids.	[]
Jimmy	27	0	But, Mr. Meryl, we're trying to bring the news to the students. They need to know the facts, and our news team delivers them, very much.	[]
Mr. Meryl	22	0	Kids don't care about the news, boys. It's boring. Kids wanna see animals, close-up, with a wide angle lens!	[]
Cartman	14	0	Please, Mr. Meryl, but, the news is our life. Without it, we have nothing.	[]
Mr. Meryl	24	1	I'm sorry, kids. Y-y-you should be proud of what you've done. It's just that it's kind of gay.	['gay']
Cartman	3	1	...You're gay!	['gay']
Butters	10	0	Gee whiz. We sure worked hard on that new show.	[]
Stan	9	0	Apparently it doesn't matter how hard you work.	[]
Whistlin' Willy	7	0	Hello boys, ready to do some whistlin'?	[]
Cartman	10	1	Fuck off, Whistlin' Willy. We're not in the mood.	['fuck']
Whistlin' Willy	14	0	If you want a pizza, you've gotta whistle.  Come on!  There you go!	[]
Cartman	11	0	God, I wish we had a Pizza Hut in South Park.	[]
Stan	6	0	Hey, look, Craig just walked in.	[]
Bradley	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Kid 1	5	0	Hey look, it's Craig!	[]
Kevin	4	0	Hey, Craig, over here!	[]
Kyle	8	0	Geez, all that from a stupid video show.	[]
Craig	10	0	Oh hey guys. Heard about your news show being cancelled.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Go play with yourself, Craig.	[]
Craig	26	0	Yeah, well, I've got an overall deal with the school, heh. They're paying me six dollars a week to come up with new shows.	[]
Stan	8	0	Your idea took about this much thought, Craig!	[]
Craig	16	0	This much more than you had!  Hey, a round of root beers for everyone! On me!	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Woohoo!)	[]
Cartman	10	2	Kenny, what the hell are you doing with this asshole?!	['hell', 'asshole']
Kenny	9	0	(Craig just asked me to do his show, geez.)	[]
Cartman	59	1	You're helping Craig make his show?! I can't believe you would betray us like that! We've always been supercool to you!  Hahahahahaaahaaa! We're gonna do a news show, and you can't do it with us, because you are too poo-oor, and poor people don't watch the new-oos! Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa! Ah whatever, Kenny!	['poo']
Craig	13	0	Hey gang, I brought the new episode of wide angle, close-up animals.	[]
Clyde	8	0	Put it, put it up on the, monitors!	[]
Kids	3	0	Cuuute.  Super cuuute.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Gah, I just don't get it.	[]
Token	6	0	Wow, those animals are pretty cute.	[]
Stan	40	0	Token! Now, come on, guys! We worked too hard to just roll over for Craig and his stupid overall deal. Instead of sitting here feeling sorry for ourselves, we just need to figure out how to make our show better!	[]
Kyle	22	0	Yeah. Maybe if we can get higher ratings by the end of the week, they'll let us stay on the air!	[]
Butters	6	0	Well, what are we waitin' for?!	[]
Stan	3	0	Come on, guys!	[]
Stan	13	0	All right, we all need to come up with ideas for our show.	[]
Kyle	11	0	How about we revamp the name? Super School News sounds dry.	[]
Cartman	5	1	It should be Sexy News.	['sexy']
Token	2	0	Action News!	[]
Stan	6	1	Yeah, Sexy Action, that's good.	['sexy']
Kyle	14	0	Maybe the problem is we don't have very good stories to report on.	[]
Cartman	13	0	Right. We should make up stories, because they'll be far more interesting.	[]
Butters	26	0	Hey, yeah. Uh why I could say I saw celebrities even though I didn't, a-a-and then lie about what I saw them doing.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Nice, Butters, write that down!	[]
Butters	3	0	Lie about celebrities.	[]
Stan	18	0	We have to appeal to all the students, so we, we need hot girls for the sixth graders...	[]
Cartman	6	0	And panda bears for the preschoolers.	[]
Stan	1	0	Good!	[]
Kyle	18	0	Maybe we need to make students think they have to watch our news show or they'll die.	[]
Token	17	0	Yeah! We should make up a bunch of reports about how dangerous it is to be alive.	[]
Butters	2	0	Oh, boy!	[]
Jimmy	10	0	Fellas, are you sure all of this ie-eh-ethical?	[]
Cartman	14	0	We're in fourth grade, Jimmy. We don't even know what ethical means.	[]
Stan	21	1	All right, Sexy Action School News Team, it's time to go to work. Get out there and get some stories!	['sexy']
Butters	6	2	Sexy Action School News Team, ho!	['sexy', 'ho']
Cartman	42	0	Ah, Token, can I have a quick word with you?  Look, Token, I-I know the guys are having trouble bringing this up with you, but uh... Well the thing is, Token, we... we really need to revamp your whole TV persona.	[]
Token	1	0	Huh?	[]
Cartman	73	0	You see Token, people really enjoy seeing African-Americans on the news... Seeing African-Americans on the news, not hearing them. That's why all African-Americans newspeople learn to talk more... wha, how should I say... white.  Token, all the great African-Americans newspeople have learned to hide their ebonic tribespeak with a more pure Caucasian dialect. There's no shame in it, and I think it'll really help our ratings.	[]
Announcer	18	1	This is South Park Elementary School closed-circuit television. And now,  Time with the Sexy Action School News!	['sexy']
Cartman	30	0	Is South Park about to explode from a methane gas leak? More on that later. But first, Stan Marsh has a look at some new outfits for the Raisins girls!	[]
Raisins Girls	2	0	Woohoo! Woohoo!	[]
Stan	27	0	Eric, the outfits are even skimpier than before, leaving very little to the imagination. No doubt that if I were a little older, I would be aroused.	[]
Raisins Girls	1	0	Woowhoowoo!	[]
Cartman	23	0	And now, for a look at the weather, here is Token Black, and Token, I hope there's no tornadoes headed our way.	[]
Token	26	0	No tornadoes, Eric, but interestingly enough, there is a low-pressure storm moving in over the Park County Valley. Should bring us some chilly days ahead.	[]
Jimmy	15	0	The Park County School Board has approved a bigger budget for the computer lab up-	[]
Cartman	17	0	Oooo, hang on, Jimmy, it looks like Kyle has the dish on some students' bathroom habits. Kyle?	[]
Kyle	34	0	Eric, sources are speculating that third-grade student, Pete Thelman , pees sitting down like a girl. We've also got confirmation that Sally Turner  stuffs her bra. And Clyde Donovan has only one testicle.	[]
Cartman	5	1	One testicle!  What an asshole!	['asshole']
Token	10	0	Uh-oh, looks like it's Panda Bear Madness Minute!	[]
Cartman	18	0	Oh yeah, Panda Bear Madness! And now, let's get a look at the celebrity watch, with Butters.	[]
Jimmy	13	0	This isn't the news, this is a tr-tr-tr-tr-travesty.	[]
Cartman	32	0	All right, so after my report on the unsanitary conditions of the school cafeteria, we're go to Kyle for the story on Brian Teeves trying to make out with Susan Farkle.	[]
Stan	20	0	Then, let's do Token's report on how global warming is going to kill everyone in the fifth grade.	[]
Token	8	0	That is a terrific idea, Stan, A-Okay.	[]
Jimmy	27	1	Fellas! Fellas, I got fant-tastic news! The vice-President, Dick Cheney, was in Denver yesterday, and I got an interview with him for our news show.	['dick']
Cartman	30	0	Oooo, interview with the vice-President, hmmm. Frankly, Jimmy, I don't know how we're gonna fit that in between cheerleader pie-eating and Who's got Skidmarks Monday.	[]
Jimmy	5	0	But this is real news!	[]
Cartman	5	0	It's boring news, Jimmy.	[]
Jimmy	12	0	How do you know?! You you haven't s-seen it yet!	[]
Cartman	6	0	All right, tell me about it.	[]
Jimmy	12	0	Well, in the interview, Mr. Cheney tells me all about how the-	[]
Cartman	16	0	Aww! Ohh! God, I just got so sleepy. I'm sorry, what were we talking about?	[]
Jimmy	22	0	Look, fellas, I've got a real problem with the direction our news show is going! We're dumbing down the school!	[]
Stan	15	0	No, Jimmy, the school is already dumb. We're just giving them what they want.	[]
Kyle	9	0	We're making the news more appealing to students.	[]
Jimmy	102	1	This isn't the news! This a b-b-bastardized quest for ratings! Damnit, we have a journalistic responsibility to bring students the fa... the facts!  Don't you see what we've done? In our efforts to compete with Craig's small-minded show, we've made a mockery of n-nununews reporting. I remember when we all made an oath to each other, way back when started playing news reporter, that we would never let anything jeopardize our integrity! Well our integrity is jeopardized! And if we can't report news the honest way, what good is n-news reporting?	['damnit']
Mr. Meryl	34	0	Boys, first of all, I want to tell you how impressed I am with your ability to get more ratings. Your show beat Close-up Animals with a Wide Angle Lens by three viewers!	[]
The Boys	4	0	All right! Woohoo! Awesome!	[]
Stan	6	0	I knew we could do it!	[]
Kyle	5	0	We beat Close-up Animals!	[]
Cartman	20	0	Oh man, this is so great! We, we worked so hard to be on top! Oh, oh come'ere you!	[]
Mr. Meryl	14	0	Yes, but unfortunately, you got crushed in the ratings by Craig's new show.	[]
Stan	4	0	Craig's new show?	[]
Mr. Meryl	39	0	All the students love it. It's an incredible idea called Close-up Animals With a Wide Angle Lens... Wearing Hats. Take a look.  That Craig is a freakin' genius, I tell ya. He's like... an idea machine.	[]
Butters	10	0	Does... Does this mean we're still gonna get cancelled?	[]
Mr. Meryl	32	0	I'm afraid it's worse than that, boys. I'm gonna have to give you all F's in Extracurricular AV Class. You have to learn now how important ratings are!	[]
Stan	9	0	Hey wha-b-but we gave it our best.	[]
Mr. Meryl	10	0	Yes.  And I guess your best wasn't good enough  .	[]
Stan	5	0	I don't believe it.	[]
Cartman	14	0	I can't lose this extracurricular credit. I need it to pass fourth grade!	[]
Butters	3	0	Stupid news hair!	[]
Jimmy	18	0	Fellas! Don't you see? This proves my point. We have to elevate our ideas up, not down.	[]
Kyle	16	0	Yeah, Jimmy's right. I know we can come up with way better ideas than Craig.	[]
Stan	21	0	Yeah. To save our show, all we need to do is come up with the best idea for an episode ever!	[]
Kyle	10	0	What if we do a show where we-  Uh, no.	[]
Cartman	7	0	How about we have us, um... hmmm.	[]
Stan	9	0	Come on, doesn't anybody have any show ideas?	[]
Butters	15	0	Well, how about we get panda bears and we have them dance around with us?	[]
Token	3	0	We did that!	[]
Jimmy	7	0	Wow, coming up with ideas is... hard.	[]
Stan	23	0	Look, you guys, if Craig can do it, we can do it! Come on!  How about we do... a show... with us... ughhh.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Thee... uhhh. What if the-?	[]
Cartman	7	0	Wait, I've got it.  Crab people.	[]
Stan	2	0	Crab people?	[]
Cartman	13	0	They're like half crab, half people, and they live below the ground.	[]
Stan	12	0	Dude, I think we can do a little better than crab people.	[]
Butters	15	0	I know! We should read the funnies!  I always get good ideas from the funnies.	[]
Cartman	8	1	Butters, only gay little dweebs read the funnies!	['gay']
Butters	37	0	Yeah! I read 'em all the time! Uh here's one: the uh, snail tripped over a hurdle, and the other snail says Well that's gonna add another hour to his time.  Yeah! You guys!  Heh.	[]
Cartman	10	0	How about we do a show where we kill Butters?	[]
Butters	17	0	So Dagwood says Good, guh-good thing we're playin' ...uh the back nine at your house.	[]
Stan	8	0	We're hopelessly stuck, completely out of ideas.	[]
Cartman	6	0	We have crab people. Just sayin'.	[]
Kyle	16	0	Wait! You know what we should do? We should all take a bunch of cough medicine!	[]
Token	2	0	Cough medicine?	[]
Kyle	30	0	That's what the sixth graders do behind the school at recess. They take way too much cough medicine because they say it makes them see things in their heads.	[]
Butters	9	0	Gee whiz, there sure is a lot of 'em.	[]
Kyle	8	0	How do we know which one to use?	[]
Stab	17	0	How about this one? Calminex?  Warning: Taking more than the recommended amount can cause severe side effects.	[]
Cartman	3	0	That sounds perfect.	[]
Jimmy	3	0	B-b-bingo!	[]
Pharmacist	5	0	Can I help you boys?	[]
Stan	22	0	Uh, yeah, we need to come up with some ideas and inspiration, so we're gonna drink a bunch of cough medicine.	[]
Pharmacist	13	0	Whoa, boys! That's not what you need to come up with ideas.	[]
Kyle	3	0	It's not?	[]
Pharmacist	19	0	No! What you want is Calminex PM.  It has the dexatrimfan in it that causes hallucinations in large doses.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Oh, okay.	[]
Pharmacist	48	1	Now, if it's more of a lucid, speedy kind of high you're looking for, I do also carry the Daytab Cold and Flu. Then there's the maximum-strength Cortitussin Cough and Cold, but of course, that's only if you really want to trip balls.	['balls']
Jimmy	6	0	Wha-what do you think, fellas?	[]
Stan	9	0	I guess we'll just take all of 'em.	[]
Pharmacist	27	0	That's the spirit! All right, boys, I'll just need your parents' permission.  Kidding! I'm just pulling your legs. Come on over to the register.	[]
Herbert Garrison	11	0	Oh, looks like somebody else is doin' a little partyin' tonight.	[]
Mr. Slave	3	0	Oh, Jesus Christ	[]
Butters	7	0	Woo. We aren't havin' a party.	[]
Herbert Garrison	15	0	Oh yeah, sure, you're just buyin' that for your bad coughs, right?  Us too.	[]
Mr. Slave	1	0	Jesus.	[]
Kyle	27	0	All right, now everybody take a tablet and a pencil.  and when all the ideas start coming, just write 'em down. We might not remember everything otherwise.	[]
Butters	19	0	Oh boy, I can't wait to be creative and smart.  Hohhh, it's all thick and g-gooey.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Huh. I don't have any ideas yet.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Stan?  Dude, Stan, you all right?	[]
Jimmy	8	0	I think maybe he's f-feeling it.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Stan, are you getting good ideas?	[]
Butters	9	0	Whoa...  I'm feeling kind of bowling-ballish, fellas.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Stan? Stan, come on. We're gonna go find a frog.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Oh dude, I just got the best idea	[]
Kyle	2	0	Me too.	[]
Butters	8	0	Hey! Let's run naked through the street!	[]
Cartman	6	0	Dude, this TV show is awesome.	[]
Stan	10	0	It's... it's the greatest show of all time.	[]
Kyle	6	0	I could watch this for days.	[]
The Boys	3	0	Cuuute. Super cuuute.	[]
Stan	6	0	You guys. You guys, wake up!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Ah!	[]
Butters	1	0	Huh?	[]
Kyle	5	0	Butters, get away from me!	[]
Butters	7	0	Oh J-Jesus, where are my clothes?!	[]
Stan	22	0	We took a bunch of cough medicine to come up with ideas for our show. I didn't come up with anything.	[]
Cartman	14	0	I-I did. I wrote something down.  Here it is! Uh, squiggly line, circle.	[]
Kyle	12	0	I wrote down... all the lyrics to the Happy Days theme song.	[]
Stan	10	0	You guys, we watched Craig's show all night long.	[]
Token	4	0	Yeah. It was great.	[]
Stan	39	0	No, but don't you see? We didn't think it was great before. I think I understand now.  I think I know why Craig's show gets such great ratings! Half the school is high on cough medicine!	[]
Kyle	5	0	Jesus, you may be right.	[]
Jimmy	31	0	Fellas, this is our chance! Everyone get your hair looking as fantastic as possible. It's time for us to do the most incredible investigative news report of our journalistic lives!	[]
Announcer	47	2	This is closed-circuit television for South Park Elementary School. And now,  a Sexy Action News Team Special Report: Cough Medicine Abuse in School!  With the Sexy Action School News Team!  It's the report you can't afford to miss!  And now here is Rick Cartman!	['sexy', 'sexy']
Cartman	55	1	They call it cough syrup, cough medicine, cold and flu remedy. But behind closed doors at South Park Elementary it also has a street name. Coochie, wombat juice, tigger yum yum. Hello, I'm Rick Cartman. Today, the Sexy Action School News Team takes you inside the dark and lonely world... of cough medicine abuse.	['sexy']
Stan	10	0	They're doing it in the hallways!  Behind the school!	[]
Red Goth	8	1	Hey, get out of here, you fuckin' dork!	['fuckin']
Stan	5	0	Even in the girls' bathroom!	[]
Bebe	9	0	Is somebody in there?! I'll tell on you!	[]
Stan	8	0	We showed the shocking footage to the principal!	[]
Principal Victoria	3	0	Oh my goodness!	[]
Jimmy	22	0	P- Principal Victoria, can you explain how your administration fuh-failed to see this p-p-pro-o-o... p-p-problem.	[]
Principal Victoria	3	0	Well I... we...	[]
Kyle	44	1	So where are students getting all this cough medicine??  This surveillance footage shows a group of troubled kids getting all the smack they want from a pharmacist!  Sexy Action School News reported the pharmacist to the South Park police, and he was immediately arrested!	['sexy']
Token	36	0	The cough companies claim they don't intend for their product to be used by kids to get high! But one look at the packaging tells otherwise.  Theradryl DM. For kids.  Dexa Cough, children's formula.	[]
Cartman	11	0	And now, for a quick celebrity check, here's Butters Stotch.	[]
Butters	11	0	Still no celebrities, Eric. Uhn, I'll keep my eyes open.	[]
Stan	38	0	The cough medicine problem used to also run rampant in neighboring Middle Park Elementary. But they took action: ridded their entire town of cough medicine, and what we see now is a happier school, 100% cough medicine-free.	[]
Mr. Meryl	42	0	Boys, I want to congratulate you on what is perhaps the finest piece of student television I've ever seen. Not only did you get all the students and myself off of couch medicine, but you got a 22 in the ratings!	[]
Kyle	5	0	Twenty-two people?! All right!	[]
Craig	7	0	You wanted to see me, Mr. Meryl?	[]
Mr. Meryl	14	0	Oh yes, Craig. It appears that the ratings for your show are down significantly.	[]
Stan	4	0	Gee, what a concidence.	[]
Jimmy	6	0	I wonder... oo-oo.. w-why?	[]
Mr. Meryl	27	0	You need to know how important ratings are, Craig, so, I'm going to suspend you from school and request that you have your testicles removed surgically.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Haha! In your face, Craig!	[]
Mr. Meryl	28	0	You boys are approved for twenty-seven new shows. I want you to come up with an even better idea than the cough medicine story. Get to it!	[]
Stan	4	0	Nobody has any ideas?	[]
Cartman	22	0	This sucks. I don't wanna keep havin' to come up with ideas for shows all the time. It hurts my head.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Dude, bail?	[]
Cartman	3	0	...I think bail.	[]
Stan	1	0	...Bail.	[]
Jimmy	5	0	Yep, b-b-b-bail.	[]
