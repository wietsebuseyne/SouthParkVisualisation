Chris	4	0	Yes?  Oh, hello, boys.	[]
Cartman	20	0	Hello, sir. South Park Junior Detectives. We're wondering if you have any crimes to be solved, for a dollar.	[]
Chris	20	0	Oooo, little crime stoppers, huh? Well, I'm afraid I don't have any crimes I need solved right now.	[]
Kyle	2	1	Awww, shit!	['shit']
Stan	11	0	All right, sir, well, please call us if you need anything.	[]
Chris	7	0	I'll do that. Have fun, boys.	[]
Cartman	10	1	Stupid assholes!  How come nobody has a crime to solve?	['assholes']
Kyle	12	0	Yeah, maybe starting a detective club isn't such a bright idea.	[]
Stan	13	0	It's a great idea, we just have to keep working at it.	[]
Mrs. Farnickle	4	0	Oh, hello there boys.	[]
Stan	25	0	Hello, ma'am, we're detectives with the South Park Crime Unit. Do you have any crimes you need to be solved, for a dollar?	[]
Mrs. Farnickle	13	0	Ohh, neighborhood detectives, huh? Well let me thi-oh yes! There is something!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Really?	[]
Mrs. Farnickle	29	0	Yes. Two days ago I put a fresh baked cherry pie out on my window sill to cool.  And later, when I went to get it, it was gone.	[]
Cartman	2	0	My God...	[]
Stan	8	0	Have you reported this to any other authorities?	[]
Mrs. Farnickle	12	0	Noo, but I think it's a perfect case for you kids.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Cool! We'll see what we can find, ma'am.	[]
Stan	5	0	We're on the case.	[]
Cartman	5	0	What have you got, Marsh?	[]
Stan	5	0	Detective McCormick found something interesting.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Jesus, we're too late.	[]
Kyle	9	0	I think we can piece this case together now.	[]
Mrs. Farnickle	10	0	My pie tin! Oooh, but what happened to the pie?	[]
Kyle	15	0	Well, we've all talked it through and we've come up with a theory.	[]
Mr. Farnickle	8	0	Well, what do you think happened, little detectives?	[]
Stan	27	0	You said you set the pie in the window sill, where it must have sat for some time.  But its sweet smell attracted the attention of somebody.	[]
Kyle	19	0	Your husband.  He wanted that pie badly, but he knew that he was not allowed to eat it yet.	[]
Cartman	35	0	Slowly the rage built inside his mind.  Why won't she let me eat that pie? Why does she always stop me from doing what I wanna do?! His only solution became obvious: Kill her!	[]
Stan	7	0	His plan was to use a hammer.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Bash, bash, BASH your skull in, causing instant death.	[]
Stan	20	0	Then to make it impossible for police to identify the body, he'd use a shovel to remove your head.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Then saw off the arms and legs.	[]
Cartman	8	0	The torso he would dump into the lake.	[]
Stan	14	0	The arms and legs he would dissolve with acid and lye in the bathtub.	[]
Cartman	11	0	And then, finally, he'd be able to eat that pie.	[]
Kyle	22	0	But before he could go through with this entire plan, he discovered that the pie had already been eaten...  ...by your dog.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Looks like the game is over, old man!	[]
Mrs. Farnickle	12	0	Oh my God, what kind of television have you kids been watching??	[]
Stan	3	0	Just the news.	[]
Mrs. Farnickle	10	0	All right, all right, you you boys run along now.	[]
Stan	7	0	Hey, you owe us a dollar, lady.	[]
Mrs. Farnickle	4	0	Fine, here, just go!	[]
Stan	7	0	Wow, look, you guys! Our first dollar!	[]
Kyle	4	0	We're in business!	[]
Cartman	12	0	Kenny, you got the f-a-g on that perp in Washington	[]
Liane	6	0	Boys, you have a little visitor.	[]
Girl	7	0	Is this the South Park Crime Unit?	[]
The Boys	2	0	Ah! Oh.	[]
Stan	3	0	Yes it is!	[]
Girl	4	0	I lost my dolly.	[]
Cartman	25	1	Thank you, Ms. Secretary, that will be all.  And get some more cookies and coffee! We're not paying you to sit on your ass!	['ass']
Kyle	7	0	Do you kow where your doll is?	[]
Girl	11	0	If I knew where it was, it wouldn't be lost.	[]
Stan	22	0	All right, Sarah, come over here.  Now, I want you to describe what the doll looks like to our sketch artist, Kenny.	[]
Sarah	21	0	She has curly blonde hair. And a red dress. And a turned-up nose. And a blue bow in her hair.	[]
Stan	4	0	You got it, Ken?	[]
Kyle	13	1	All right, let's see.  Dammit Kenny, that's not what she said!	['dammit']
Stan	4	0	Put that away, dude!	[]
Cartman	10	0	Don't worry, ma'am. We'll find your doll.	[]
Cartman	5	0	No sign of forced entry.	[]
Kyle	6	0	But the window isn't locked.	[]
Stan	39	0	Right, so it's possible that the thief sat out in that tree.  He would have watched Sarah with the doll, possibly while cutting the palms of his hands with a large knife.  The pain gave him sick pleasure.	[]
Kyle	20	0	Disposing of the doll wouldn't be easy. He would have had to have brought a shovel to decapitate it.	[]
Cartman	12	1	We're going to need semen samples from everything in this room.	['semen']
A Boy	29	0	All right, let's do this by the books! McDonnell,  give me smears of all the places the doll used to be!  Mitchell,  run a tap on the phone!	[]
Stan	6	0	Hey, kid, what are you doing?	[]
The Boy	5	0	Agent Tucker, FBI! And you?	[]
Stan	9	0	Detective Marsh. I'm in charge of this investigation!	[]
Tucker	5	0	...Not anymore, you're not!	[]
Cartman	13	0	Hey, this is our case! You can't come in and take over!	[]
Tucker	18	0	Can't we? You guys are playing Detective. We're playing FBI. That gives us jurisdiction over you!	[]
Stan	2	1	Aw crap!	['crap']
Tucker	9	0	I want choppers on the roof ready to go!	[]
Kyle	10	0	Dude, we've been working this case since two-thirty!	[]
Tucker	12	0	Good. Then you can help us by telling me everything you know.	[]
Stan	6	1	Son of a bitch stupid FBI!	['bitch']
Cartman	10	0	Well, I guess we can go back to playing laundromat.	[]
Stan	20	0	No! We're not gonna stop playing detectives! We've just gotta find that doll before thos FBI guys do.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Yeah!)	[]
Kyle	3	0	Yeah, but how?	[]
Stan	12	0	We're gonna have to just start bringing in people for questioning.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Right. I think I know exactly where to start.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Where were you this morning at nine o'clock, Butters?!	[]
Butters	5	0	Ah, I was at home.	[]
Cartman	21	1	Your story is full of holes and I'm gonna beat your ass if you don't start tellin' the truth!	['ass']
Kenny	11	0	(Awww, don't be so mean. Butters is our friend, huh?)	[]
Stan	12	0	They've gotten really good at this good cop-bad cop thing.	[]
Cartman	8	0	You're going down, Butters! You hear me?!	[]
Kenny	9	0	(Aw, now don't say that. Poor little kid.)	[]
Cartman	11	0	You're a worthless two-dollar criminal and you're lying!	[]
Kenny	6	0	(Aww, it's okay, little fella.)	[]
Butters	9	0	Well I don't have nothin' to confess. Honestly.	[]
Cartman	11	1	Fine! Then you won't mind giving us a semen sample.	['semen']
Butters	5	0	How do I do that?	[]
Cartman	16	1	You just make the semen come out of your body and put it in this cup!	['semen']
Butters	11	1	Well how do I make semen... come out of my body?	['semen']
Cartman	3	0	Stop playing games!	[]
Butters	9	0	I'm not playing. I really don't know!	[]
Cartman	24	1	That does it! Wait right here!  Guys, did you hear that? Butters doesn't know how you make semen come out of your body.	['semen']
Kyle	7	1	How... do you make semen come out?	['semen']
Cartman	10	0	I don't know. I was hoping you guys did.	[]
Stan	20	1	It's that thing we learned about in school where you pull on your wiener until white stuff comes out.	['wiener']
Cartman	1	0	Really?	[]
Kyle	14	1	Ohh, right, you're supposed to pull and master-benate your wiener really fast.	['wiener']
Cartman	15	2	Oh okay.  Okay, retard, you really don't know how to make semen come out?!	['retard', 'semen']
Butters	1	0	No!	[]
Cartman	5	0	Follow me to the bathroom.	[]
Kenny	11	0	(Aw, it's okay, kid. It's not going to hurt.)	[]
Cartman	25	1	Now, go sit on the toilet and pull and tug on your wiener until white stuff comes out, and then put it in this cup.	['wiener']
Butters	2	0	My weiner??	[]
Cartman	12	3	Yes, retard. Semen comes from your wiener. Now do it!  Well Butters?!	['retard', 'semen', 'wiener']
Butters	11	1	Ah I'm pullin' on my wiener, but nothin's happening.	['wiener']
Cartman	3	0	Well pull harder!	[]
Butters	6	0	...ow... Ow... It's not workin'	[]
Cartman	4	0	Try doin' it faster	[]
Butters	13	0	Ow. Ow. Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow. Naw, nothin'	[]
Cartman	13	0	Butters, do you wanna go to jail for the rest of your life?!	[]
Butters	1	0	NOOooo!	[]
Cartman	14	1	The you'd better get that semen sample no matter how long it takes!	['semen']
Butters	1	0	Okay!!	[]
Stan	16	0	Cartman! Cartman! We just got a tip that a doll was found near Fosse's house!	[]
Cartman	3	0	Let's go!	[]
Butters	2	0	...ow... Ow!	[]
Fosse	17	1	Huhuh, Okay Ms., Ms. Jones, heh, me and Doctor... Flick here just need to... check your vagina.	['vagina']

Fosse	4	1	Yeah, that's gay.	['gay']
Cartman	1	0	Kyle!	[]
Kyle	2	0	What?  What??	[]
Cartman	14	1	I see two guys inside. They have Sarah Peterson's doll, you stupid Jew!	['jew']
Kyle	5	0	They've got the doll!	[]
Stan	7	0	Okay, okay. Ready? Break the door down!	[]
Fosse	5	0	Huh huh who is it?!	[]
Stan	12	0	South Park Junior Detectives! We know you have Sarah Peterson's doll!	[]
Fosse	4	0	They're playing Detective.	[]
Bill	3	1	That's gay.	['gay']
Fosse	3	1	You're gay!	['gay']
Kyle	5	0	What do we do now?	[]
Stan	4	0	I don't know.	[]
Cartman	22	0	Well if they're not gonna give us back the doll, then we have no choice. Let's go tell on them.	[]
Stan	8	0	Dude, we just can't tell on them.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Why not?	[]
Kyle	14	0	Because, dude, we're playing detectives! Detectives don't just go tell on people.	[]
Fosse	18	0	Detectives!  If you don't get out of here, we're gonna rip the doll's head off!	[]
Bill	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Fosse	10	0	We were playing gynecologists and now we're playing criminals	[]
Bill	3	1	That's gay.	['gay']
Fosse	3	1	We're gay.	['gay']
Stan	6	0	Jesus! They're gonna kill her!	[]
Kyle	6	0	We've got to do something.	[]
Cartman	14	0	Time! Time is what we need, but time is something we ain't got!	[]
Tucker	18	0	Attention! You in the house!  This is Agent Tucker with the FBI! We have you surrounded. Sort of.	[]
Stan	8	0	Hey, you buttholes can't play FBI here!	[]
Cartman	6	0	Yeah! This was our hot lead!	[]
Tucker	32	0	And you did a great job leading us here. Now you just stay out of our way!  The gig is up, Fosse! Bring out the doll! Or we'll tell on you!	[]
Stan	11	0	We're gonna charge the front door and go get it.	[]
Tucker	4	0	No you're not.	[]
Cartman	23	1	Damnit man, this is not the time for negotiations! There's a little doll in there about to have her head twisted off!	['damnit']
Tucker	25	0	Time out, kid! We say you can't charge the front door, and you have to obey what the FBI says! That's the rules!	[]
Stan	17	0	Just because your parents can afford better toys than ours doesn't make you better than us!	[]
Tucker	4	0	Yes it does so!	[]
Kyle	1	0	...Grrrr!!!	[]
Kenny	5	0	(What do we do now?)	[]
Stan	6	0	We go get the doll ourselves.	[]
Kyle	10	0	But they said we can't charge the front door.	[]
Stan	14	0	That's right.  But they didn't say anything about going in the back.	[]
Tucker	10	0	Come on guys. You don't wanna hurt that doll.	[]
Bill	12	2	Huhuh.  Oh crap, they're coming in the back!  That's gay.	['crap', 'gay']
Stan	7	0	Bang bang bang! I got you, Fosse!	[]
Fosse	4	0	No you didn't!	[]
Stan	2	0	Did so!	[]
Fosse	8	0	No, 'cause I got... special wizard armor on.	[]
Kyle	8	1	We're not playing Dungeons and Dragons, assface!	['assface']
Cartman	13	0	All right, that does it! Cover me! I'm going slo-mo!  Wwwaaahhh!	[]
Fosse	7	0	Oooh, they got me!  Whooaaa, whooaaa, whooaaa.	[]
Bill	5	0	rr uh rr uh, uhhhh.	[]
Fosse	3	0	We're dead.	[]
Bill	3	1	That's gay.	['gay']
Stan	3	0	We got it.	[]
Stan	6	0	Ms. Peterson, is your daughter home?	[]
Sarah	2	0	My dollie!	[]
Cartman	15	0	We got her back safe. We lost a lot of good men in the process.	[]
Sarah's Mom	24	0	Well you boys are little heroes. I'm going to call the police department and let them know what brave little detectives you are!	[]
Dawson	26	0	Hello there little crime stoppers, I'm Lieutenant Dawson with the Park County Police. I heard you did a great job finding Sarah Peterson's doll.	[]
Stan	6	0	We do what we can, sir.	[]
Dawson	21	1	W-hell, that's fantastic, kids. And for all your terrific sleuth-solving, I'm hereby making you all Junior Detectives.	['hell']
Kyle	1	0	Wow!	[]
Dawson	12	0	That means you boys are now an official part of the department.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Kewl!	[]
Dawson	8	0	All right, so ready for your first assignment?	[]
Stan	1	0	Sure.	[]
Dawson	35	0	Okay. There's a meth lab down at 567 Mala Vista. The operators are probably armed to the hilt with illegal weapons. I want you to get down there and see what you can find!	[]
Kyle	6	0	Ah... a a a meth lab?	[]
Dawson	47	1	I don't want any problems. Just take them down by the books. Now get over there; the mayor's all over my ass on this one!  On, and deputies: you screw this up and I'll have you working graveyard shift behind a desk! Move it!	['ass']
Kyle	6	0	What is a meth lab, anyway?	[]
Stan	19	0	I don't know. Let's just hurry up. I wanna get home in time to watch Crime Drama.	[]
Stan	13	1	Uh police. Open up. ...Oh crap, did you guys do your math homework?	['crap']
Kyle	6	0	Nah. Dude, I totally spaced it.	[]
Man 1	8	0	You die, pigs!  You want to die, huh?	[]
Man 3	6	0	You won't take us alive!	[]
Man 5	5	1	So long, coppers!  Oh, shit!	['shit']
Stan	1	1	Damn.	['damn']
Dawson	38	1	One UPS vehicle valued at twenty-five thousand dollars, one civilian vehicle valued at sixteen thousand, the second floor of the post office AND a coffee shop valued at sixteen thousand! The mayor's gonna have my ass!	['ass']
Stan	10	0	Uh, sir, we just kinda got blind-sided by the-	[]
Dawson	43	0	You got careless! Now, I don't know how they do things down at that dog-and-pony show they call the Fourth Grade, but here we have rules! Jesus, we don't have guys to question now, because you killed them all!	[]
Kyle	3	0	We're sorry.	[]
Dawson	19	0	One more slip-up like that and I'll have your badges! You hear me?! Now hit the showers!	[]
Officer 1	9	0	Well well well, if it isn't the supercops.	[]
Officer 2	12	0	Hey Murphy, think they'll let me borrow their G.I. Joes?	[]
Officer 4	7	0	Come on, you guys. Leave them alone.	[]
Murphy	21	0	Relax, Hopkins!  All fun and games, right?  Soho, tell us, rookies, you ah... find yourself a little bonus in that house??	[]
Cartman	2	0	Uh bonus?	[]
Murphy	35	0	Come on! We all skim a little off the top. Oh. Or are you too good for that?  So you think you're gonna waltz in here and clean up the system. Is that it?	[]
Stan	6	0	We just wanna be junior detectives.	[]
Murphy	29	0	LOOK, we all work hard! And we deserve more than the thirty-thousand a year we get paid! So what if we take in a little on the side?	[]
Officer 2	9	1	Yeah! Who the hell are you to say that?!	['hell']
Hopkins	5	0	I said, back off Murphy!	[]
Murphy	10	0	Why don't you and your rookie friends make us	[]
Officer 2	7	0	That's right. Come on, bring it!	[]
Officer 3	8	0	Yeah, let's go! Come on, bring it!	[]
Dawson	7	1	What the hell is the problem here??	['hell']
Murphy	7	0	No problem, sir. No problem at all.	[]
Dawson	7	0	Then hit the showers, all of ya!	[]
Kyle	8	0	Dude, I don't wanna play Detective anymore.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Me neither.	[]
Stan	5	0	It'll get better, guys.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Better how, dude?	[]
Stan	40	0	Look, we said we wanted to form a club to protect and serve South Park. We put all this time to it, I mean... What do you guys wanna do, huh? Go back to playing Car Mechanics? Or Laundromat Owners?	[]
Kyle	6	0	We were happy playing Laundromat Owners.	[]
Stan	26	0	I wasn't. We started playing Detective because we wanted our play time to mean something. Or have you forgotten why you joined the force, Kyle?	[]
Cartman	6	0	Hey! Broflovski's a good cop!	[]
Stan	35	0	You guys can go back to playing Laundromat Owners if you want, but... I'm not gonna give those kids playing the FBI a chance to laugh at us. See you guys at school tomorrow.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Awwwwrrr-auugh.	[]
Liane	9	0	Eric, where have you been? It's ten thirty.	[]
Cartman	11	0	We had to take down a meth lab on Mala Vista.	[]
Liane	6	0	Well you should've called Mommy.	[]
Cartman	53	0	Will you get off my back?! It's hard enough I gotta work the beat, and now I gotta come home to your nagging?!  Look look, I'm I'm sorry. It's just this case, and... the guys down at the station, I... I'm tired, alright? I'm I'm tired.	[]
Liane	20	0	Well, why don't you get ready for snoogums' night-night, and I'll bring you some toasty chocolate nummers?	[]
Cartman	1	0	Okay.	[]
Butters	6	0	Who-o-o-o-a. Oowwww!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Butters?	[]
Butters	1	0	Yes?	[]
Cartman	9	1	Are you still trying to give a semen sample?	['semen']
Butters	9	0	Well I'm tryin', but nothin's comin' out.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Well, keep tryin', Butters.	[]
Butters	3	0	Okay.  Ow. Ooww!	[]
Mr. Garrison	40	0	And so you can see, children, that the women's movement of the late fifties and the early sixties had a profound effect on feminism in America.  Uh, boys!  Would it trouble you terribly not to sleep in my class?	[]
Kyle	8	0	Uh wu we weren't sleeping, Mr. Garrison.	[]
Mr. Garrison	20	0	Oh well, then maybe you can tell me who was in charge of the feminist movement of the early sixties!	[]
Cartman	9	1	A bunch of fat old skanks on their periods?	['fat']
Mr. Garrison	33	0	Right, but who was the fattest oldest skank on her period?!  That's what I thought! Now pay attention!  Okay, children, now, the biggest fatass was an old skank by the name of-	[]
Dawson	7	0	Marsh! Broflovski! McCormick! Cartman! In my office!	[]
The Boys	1	0	Eeagh!	[]
Dawson	30	0	Looks like that meth lab you took down was the tip of the iceberg. They found a paper trail leading all the way to the biggest crime syndicate in Colorado.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Un oh...	[]
Dawson	27	0	The operators apparently run their business out of a sleazy strip joint down in Inglewood. They're all cop killers, so I'm sending you in undercover.	[]
Kyle	15	0	Uh, sir, d'I have a lot of homework to do tonight and I was-	[]
Dawson	67	1	What?! Now you listen to me! I'm givin' you one last chance! You're good cops, but you let your emotions get in the way! And your little shoot first ask questions later technique has no place in this century! Now you get down to that strip joint and you do it by the books, you got it?! The mayor is on my ass and blablablah!	['ass']
Murphy	11	0	So, what did you boys have to say to the lieutenant?	[]
Stan	9	0	Nothing, he just told us a bunch of stuff.	[]
Murphy	12	0	Maybe you decided you needed to tell him about our... bonus money.	[]
Kyle	1	0	No.	[]
Officer 2	3	0	They're lying.	[]
Murphy	3	0	They're dead!	[]
Kyle	16	0	Dude, if my mom knew I was in here, I would be in super big trouble.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Woohoo!!)	[]
Stripper	5	0	Would you like a dance?	[]
Stan	2	0	No thanks.	[]
Stripper	5	0	Dance?  Anyone like a dance?	[]
DJ	24	0	Well all right, guests, put your hands together. Be sure to tip the dancers. And now, come on, let's hear it for Candy!	[]
Bouncer	19	1	Whoa whoa, what the hell are you kids doin' in here? This isn't an appropriate place for children	['hell']
Stripper	5	0	Dance? Anyone like a dance?	[]
Kyle	8	0	Uh, it's okay. We know the owner.	[]
Stripper	6	0	Oh, really? Let's go see.	[]
Owner	16	0	All right, so we'll have to start havin' the McCormicks make our meth again and-	[]
Bouncer	8	0	Hey Gino, these kids say they know you.	[]
Gino	8	0	What? Ha-I don't know no kids.	[]
Bouncer	9	0	I didn't think so. All right, you kids-	[]
Gino	29	1	Hey wait a minute. These kids might be just what we need to get our drugs past the security at DIA. How would you like to join our family?	['drugs']
Tall Goon	16	0	Yo Gino, I know I've seen these kids before, man. These kids are 5-0!	[]
Gino	1	0	What?	[]
Tall Goon	5	0	These kids are cops, man!	[]
Cartman	3	0	Bang bang bang...	[]
"Stan, Kyle, Cartman"	3	0	Bang bang bang...	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Pakew! Pakew!)	[]
Cartman	12	0	Kenny, it doesn't go Pakew! Pakew!, it goes BANG BANG BANG!!	[]
Dawson	16	1	God damnit! Those junior detectives and their heroicly reckless ways! Murphy! Jenkins! Hopkins! Get in there!	['damnit']
Stripper	5	0	Dance??? Anybody like a dance???	[]
Hopkins	12	0	Freeze! South Park detectives!  Great job, boys. You found the meth boss!	[]
Gino	14	1	Detective Murphy! Jenkins! Uh what the hell are you doing? We had a deal.	['hell']
Hopkins	2	0	A deal?	[]
Murphy	19	1	That's right. We're partners in the drug business. Everything was fine until these supercops joined the force.	['drug']
Jenkins	7	0	Now we've gotta kill you all.	[]
Hopkins	2	0	Boys! Down!	[]
DJ	28	0	Huh alright guys, put your hands together, a lot of shootin' and killin' goin' on, but be sure to tip your waitress let's hear it for Rebecca.	[]
Dawson	10	0	Christ! Those junior detectives have no regard for the law!	[]
Lead FBI agent	15	0	Get me a hard line to the phone! And I want choppers on the roof!	[]
Dawson	5	1	Who the hell are you??	['hell']
Lead FBI agent	3	0	Agent Fields, FBI!	[]
Dawson	8	0	Hey, I'm in charge of this investigation.	[]
Fields	5	0	Not anymore, you're not.	[]
Dawson	5	0	But that's not fair!	[]
Fields	4	0	Is so! Is so!	[]
Jenkins	12	0	Sorry, Detective Hopkins. We can't let anybody know about our partnership.	[]
Gino	9	0	That's right. We split it all, fifty-fifty!	[]
Murphy	12	0	That's right.  I think we'll take a hundred percent now.	[]
Jenkins	14	0	Huhuh yeah. Sorry, Gino, but in business like this, sometimes partnerships need to end.	[]
Murphy	39	0	That's right.  Sometimes partnerships need to end.  Well, supercops, looks like I'll be taking in all the money now. I'm in business alone. And that means that the only person I can't trust... is myself.	[]
Hopkins	25	0	It looks like Murphy and Jenkins got what they deserved. If it weren't for you boys, we would have never cleaned up the department.	[]
Dawson	32	0	All right, detectives, let's get one thing straight! I do not agree with your methods! You're uncontrolled, and you're negligent! But by God you get the job done. Congratulations!	[]
Stan	1	0	Thanks.	[]
Dawson	30	0	I'm probably going to regret this, but, well, I'm promoting you to full detectives. There'll be lots of action, and that big paycheck you've always wanted.	[]
Stan	7	0	...I think I have a better idea.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Hello, sir. Welcome to the Broflovski Laundromat.	[]
Stan	14	0	Yes, I have a suit that needs to be dry-cleaned. And pressed, please.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Certainly.	[]
Cartman	22	0	Here you are, Mister McCormick. Your laundry is all done and folded. That will be nine ninety five.  On your American Express.	[]
Butters	12	1	Fellas! Hehey fellas! I got it! Ah I got my semen sample!	['semen']
Cartman	2	0	You did?	[]
Butters	33	2	Yeah. I was up there poundin' my wiener for two days straight, aaand finally, I thought about Stan's Mom's boobs, and this little tiny spooge of... this white stuff came out.	['wiener', 'boobs']
Kyle	16	0	That's great, Butters, but we're not playing Detective anymore. We're playing laundromat owners.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Would you like those pants cleaned for four ninety five?	[]
