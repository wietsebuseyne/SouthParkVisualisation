The Boys	9	0	School days, school days, teacher's golden rule day...	[]
Kyle	3	1	Ah, damn it!	['damn']
Cartman	1	0	What?	[]
Kyle	13	1	My God-damned little brother's trying to follow me to school, again!	['damned']
Ike	3	1	Suck my balls.	['balls']
Kyle	10	0	No, Ike! You can't come to school with me.	[]
Cartman	6	1	Yeah! Go home, you little dildo!	['dildo']
Kyle	12	1	Dude, for the last time, don't call my brother a dildo!	['dildo']
Cartman	10	3	Alright, go home, you little semen-puking asshole dickhead!  Ow!	['semen', 'asshole', 'dickhead']
Stan	2	0	Dude, sweet!	[]
Kyle	9	0	Yeah. Check it out.  Ready Ike? Kick the baby!	[]
Ike	6	1	Don't kick the goddamn baby!	['goddamn']
Kyle	2	0	Kick it!	[]
Ike	2	0	Waaaah--  Ow.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Uuugh.	[]
Kyle	12	0	Whoa Cartman. Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.	[]
Cartman	12	0	That's because I was having these bogus nightmares all night long.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Really? What about?	[]
Cartman	64	1	Well, I dreamt that I was lying in my bed...  in the dark. When all of a sudden this bright blue light filled the room . Then slowly my bedroom door begin to open  and the next thing I remember I was being drug through a hallway.  Then these scary hands wanted to operate on me.  And they had big heads and big black eyes...	['drug']
Stan	2	0	Dude! Visitors!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Totally!	[]
Cartman	1	0	What?	[]
Stan	9	0	That wasn't a dream Cartman, those were visitors!	[]
Cartman	10	0	No, it was just a dream,  my mom said so.	[]
Stan	12	0	Visitors are real. They...  Wait a minute. This has all happened before.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Yeah. This does seem really familiar.	[]
Cartman	8	0	What the Funk & Wagnalls are you talkin' about?	[]
Kyle	12	0	Cartman, don't you remember the last time you had this dream?	[]
Cartman	13	0	Eh-ih... shut up you guys, you're just tryin' to scare me.	[]
Stan	32	0	No, dude, this happened before! Aliens put some device in you and then we tied you up to a tree and you went up on their ship! You don't remember that?	[]
Cartman	6	0	No I don't remember that!	[]
Kyle	3	0	You don't?	[]
Cartman	7	0	No, because the aliens erased my memory!	[]
Stan	23	0	I remember this whole thing.  Ike tried to follow you to school. You kicked him, then Cartman told us about his alien dream.	[]
Kyle	9	0	Yeah, and then Chef pulled up in his car.	[]
Chef	3	0	Hello there, children!	[]
Kyle	4	0	And then you said	[]
Stan	8	0	What's gonna be for lunch today, Chef?	[]
Chef	10	0	Well, today it's Salisbury steak with hot buttered noodles	[]
All	10	0	and a choice of green bean salad or vegetable medley.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Weird	[]
Chef	6	0	Say, did any of you children	[]
All	7	0	see the alien space ship last night?	[]
Chef	2	0	What the?	[]
Stan	6	0	Chef, we're in a repeat.	[]
Chef	2	0	A repeat??	[]
Kyle	22	0	Cartman was visited by aliens again last night. And now it's like we're living a repeat of a previous day.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Aw dude, I hate repeats!	[]
Chef	16	0	I've been feelin' dej_ vu all mornin', children. I knew somethin' strange was goin' on!	[]
Stan	9	1	It all started when Cartman got an anal probe.	['anal']
Chef	10	0	We have to get Eric to a proctologist right away.	[]
Kyle	6	0	What is a proc-tologist, Chef?	[]
Chef	10	1	He's a doctor that specializes in your asshole, children.	['asshole']
Stan	20	0	You mean, at some point in this doctor's life he decided he wanted to work on people's buttholes.	[]
Chef	3	0	That's right.	[]
Kyle	3	1	What a dick!	['dick']
Proctologist	2	0	Hello everyone!	[]
Chef	10	0	Hello Doctor. Thanks for seein' Eric on such short notice.	[]
Proctologist	6	0	What seems to be the problem?	[]
Chef	16	0	We just want you to take a look and tell us if you see anything abnormal.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Other than his monstrous size.	[]
Cartman	8	1	SHUT UP, KYLE! SHUT YOUR GOD-DAMNED MOUTH!	['damned']
Proctologist	9	0	All right, let's see here.  Oh my God!!	[]
Cartman	1	0	What?	[]
Proctologist	11	1	Why, there's a huge crack goin' right down the middle!	['crack']
Cartman	3	0	Haha, very funny.	[]
Stan	11	0	Yeah, like we haven't heard that one a zillion times.	[]
Proctologist	7	0	All right, let's take a look.	[]
Cartman	11	1	Heey, just what the hell do you think you're doing?	['hell']
Chef	9	0	Eric, the doctor has to feel inside your rectum.	[]
Kyle	13	0	And afterwards, he'll probably have to burn his hand and bury it.	[]
Cartman	32	2	Kyle, I swear, if I didn't have a guy's hand up my ass right now, I'd leap across the room and kick you in the nuts. Eh. Oohh. Eow.	['ass', 'nuts']
Proctologist	13	0	Well the prostate seems to be normal. No swelling of the hemorrhoidal gland...	[]
Cartman	6	0	Eh- Aaaaah. Ooooo-ah. Uuuuu aaaaa.	[]
Proctologist	4	0	Wait, what's this?	[]
Kyle	3	0	Are you okay?	[]
Cartman	12	0	Dude. You know that feeling when you take a huuuge dump? Awesome!	[]
Chef	2	0	Well, doctor?	[]
Proctologist	15	0	I've never quite seen this before, uh... Perhaps he just needs some hemorrhoid cream.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Aaaaaa aaaaaa ooagh!	[]
Stan	3	0	You all right?	[]
Cartman	22	1	You know the feeling when the huge dump you just took shoots back up inside your ass? NO IM NOT ALL RIGHT!!	['ass']
Proctologist	9	0	I've never seen a hemorrhoid react this way.	[]
Chef	23	0	That wasn't no hemorrhoid, it was an alien hoobajoob! Come on, children! We've got to get Eric to some real help!	[]
Stan	4	0	Where to now, Chef?	[]
Chef	25	1	That thing inside Eric's asshole looked like some kinda alien satellite dish. We need to see my friend down at the Space Center now!	['asshole']
Chef	18	0	And you're the only person I could think of who might be able to help us, Jeff.	[]
Jeff	8	0	How do we uh, make it come out?	[]
Chef	10	0	Someone just has to activate it like the proctologist did.	[]
Cartman	17	1	Ohhh no no nonono! Nobody is putting their finger in my ass again! Unless it's Kyle.	['ass']
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Kyle	6	0	No way!  You do it, Kenny!	[]
Cartman	6	0	Nope! It has to be Kyle!	[]
Stan	2	0	Go on.	[]
Kyle	10	1	I'm not putting my finger up Cartman's butt!	['butt']
Chef	10	0	Kyle, the fate of the world may be at stake.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Come, Kyle. Do hurry.  Go ahead, it won't bite.	[]
Kyle	3	1	God-damnit Cartman!	['damnit']
Cartman	7	0	I couldn't resist. I'm sorry.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Stop it Cartman!	[]
Cartman	3	0	Okay. Okay okay.	[]
Kenny	5	0	(Gaaahaha, he got you again!)	[]
Kyle	2	1	God Dammit!	['dammit']
Cartman	18	1	Haha. Oh man, that was great. Okay, go ahead. I'm all out of farts now.  Gahaaa! Derrr!	['farts']
Kenny	1	0	(Derrr!)	[]
Cartman	11	0	Okaay, okay. It's not funny anymore.  Oh yes it is!	[]
Kenny	3	0	(Yes it is!)	[]
Chef	4	0	Eric, that's enough!	[]
Cartman	5	0	Okay, okay.  Ohh, double psych!	[]
Kyle	15	0	That's it!  I don't care about the fate of the world! Screw it!	[]
Stan	4	0	Oh, nice going, Cartman!	[]
Cartman	10	0	All right, all right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	1	0	No!	[]
Cartman	6	0	No, go ahead. I'm dry.	[]
Kyle	3	0	You're lying!	[]
Chef	15	0	It stopped being funny forty seconds ago, boy! Let's just get this over with!	[]
Cartman	12	0	But it was one of the best times I've ever had.	[]
Jeff	6	0	Can I see this thing, please?	[]
Cartman	4	1	Okay.  Ohhh! God-dammit!	['dammit']
Chef	6	0	Okay. Now it's funny again.	[]
Cartman	26	0	This is so awesome. I don't think I made it out of that proctologist's office, guys. I think I died and went to heaven.	[]
Kyle	4	0	That does it! CHARGE!	[]
Chef	4	0	What's it doing?	[]
Jeff	11	0	It, it's sending a transmission of some kind.  Got it!	[]
Kyle	11	0	It's just sending images of cities and people and stuff.	[]
Chef	7	0	Where is the signal being sent to?	[]
Cartman	9	0	Ugh. I don't wanna play anymore, you guys.	[]
Kyle	12	1	We went through all that just for some gay video of Earth?	['gay']
Stan	9	0	We wanted to see an alien planet or something.	[]
Jeff	20	0	Whoever they are, if they're receiving messages, they might be sending them, too. Wait a minute. c-candy bars.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Candy bars?	[]
Jeff	64	0	Yu-you know. Candy bars. They usually come in a wrapper. Just like you... wrap a Christmas present. Christmas happens when it's cold. Cold, as in Alaska - that's... with polar bears. Polar bears... pola... polarity! I can switch the polarity to see what transmissions are coming from the location this one is being sent to!  What the heck?  They're coming in!	[]
Stan	4	0	What do we do???	[]
Cartman	13	0	It's that guy you want! He's trying to reverse your polarities!	[]
Jeff	1	0	What??	[]
Chef	1	0	Help!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Aaaah! Runrunruuun!	[]
Stan	3	0	Let's go!	[]
Chef	9	0	Get in the car, children! Get in the car!	[]
Stan	3	0	What is that?	[]
Chef	5	0	Can you see anything, children?	[]
Kyle	5	0	The aliens are chasing us!	[]
Chef	3	1	God damned aliens!	['damned']
Stan	5	0	Chef! End of the road!	[]
Chef	8	0	Hold on, children!  We have to ditch them!	[]
Cartman	5	0	What are you doing, man?!	[]
Narrator	10	0	Looks like them boys are gettin' a little fresh air.	[]
Kyle	5	0	I think we ditched them.	[]
Chef	10	0	I don't think we're outta the woods yet.	[]
Visitor Driver	2	0	Coop coop.	[]
Stan	4	0	It's the police!	[]
Chef	5	0	That ain't no police!	[]
Cartman	9	0	When do we get to eat. I'm hungry.	[]
Stan	1	0	Chef!!	[]
Chef	17	1	HA! God-damned aliens! I beat you!  Where'd you learn to drive, aliens?! Chinese auto school?!	['damned']
The Boys	6	0	Chef! Chef! They've got us!	[]
Chef	28	2	You're lucky I didn't just turn around and beat your white skinny alien asses anyway! Maybe next time you'll remember to...  Huh?  Aw crap! Children!	['asses', 'crap']
The Boys	1	0	Cheeeeeeef!	[]
Narrator	23	0	Well, it looks like the boys are in more trouble than a June bug in molasses. And it's pretty thick molasses, too.	[]
Stan	6	0	Uh.  Wugh. You guys. Wake up!	[]
Kyle	7	0	What the? Where are, where are we?	[]
Stan	6	0	We're in the alien ship.	[]
Cartman	16	1	Ah. Uh! I'm trapped inside Helen Hunt's ass!  Oh God, help me you guys!	['ass']
Kyle	13	1	It's not Helen Hunt's ass. It's an alien space ship.	['ass']
Cartman	8	0	...Oh, thank God! Well then, thank you Lord.	[]
Stan	2	0	Guys. Look.	[]
"Kyle, Cartman"	1	0	Wow.	[]
Stan	19	0	My God, do you guys realize? This is only the second time we've ever been in outer space.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Awesome)	[]
Cartman	6	0	This is like my fifth time.	[]
Stan	9	0	Uh oh. This must be the head alien guy.	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Oh no!)	[]
Alien	2	0	Hello boys.	[]
Stan	1	0	Dad?	[]
Alien	18	0	No, not really. I just read your mind and thought this form might be more pleasing to you.	[]
Kyle	9	1	Aw dude, don't do that. That's gay.	['gay']
Stan	8	0	Yeah, that's like that stupid movie, Contact.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Aw God, that movie pissed me off.	[]
Alien	17	0	Very well, I shall show my true form.  Rah rah rah rah rah. Rah rah rah rah.	[]
The Boys	1	0	AAAAH!	[]
Stan	8	0	Okay okay, take the form of something else!	[]
Alien	3	0	How's this?	[]
Cartman	1	0	Santa!	[]
Stan	5	0	Nno, that's stupid too.	[]
Alien	3	0	How about this?	[]
"Stan, Kyle, Cartman"	2	0	No.  No!	[]
Cartman	3	0	Oooo, very nice.	[]
Stan	1	0	No!	[]
Kyle	1	0	No!	[]
Alien	3	0	Dy-no-mite!	[]
The Boys	1	0	No!	[]
Chef	10	0	Jeff!! The aliens took the children up on their ship.	[]
Jeff	2	0	Oh no!	[]
Chef	10	0	Did you find out what the aliens were up to?	[]
Jeff	29	0	When I reversed the polarities, I found this:  It's a message that the aliens are broadcasting throughout the entire universe. But I have no idea what it says.	[]
Chef	15	0	They took the children, Jeff! I have to know what those aliens are up to!	[]
Jeff	5	2	Wait a minute! Butt sex!	['butt', 'sex']
Chef	2	2	Butt sex?	['butt', 'sex']
Jeff	49	2	Butt sex requires a lot of lubrication, right? Lubrication. Lubruh... Chupuh... Chupacabra 's the, the goat killer of Mexican folklore. Folklore is stories from the past that are often fictionalized. Fictionalized to heighten drama. Drama students! Students at colleges usually have bicycles! Bi, bian, binary. It's binary code!	['butt', 'sex']
Chef	5	2	Who's havin' butt sex?	['butt', 'sex']
Alien	10	0	Hello my honey, hello my baby, hello my ragtime gal!	[]
The Boys	1	0	No!	[]
Alien	8	0	Lemme search ya, gonna work ya, hepsunudupunubuh huh.	[]
The Boys	1	0	No!	[]
Alien	7	0	Don't piss on the moon, babe.	[]
The Boys	1	0	NO!	[]
Alien	11	0	All right, earthlings, what form do you want me to take?	[]
Cartman	9	1	How about a taco, that craps ice cream?  Guys?	['craps']
Stan	3	0	I like it.	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Me too.)	[]
Alien	37	0	All right, then we can get back to business. Follow me this way, earthlings.  I want to apologize to you boys for all the spooky, scary stuff. We just needed to get to the malfunctioning uplink relay.	[]
Stan	8	1	You mean, the thing in Cartman's ass?	['ass']
Alien	19	0	That's right. See, there are dishes in over fifty thousand earthlings' rectums. Your friend's has been malfunctioning.	[]
Kyle	17	1	Why do you put them into people's asses? Are you planning some kind of alien takeover?	['asses']
Alien	18	0	Oh, heavens no! We're a production company. We make intergalactic television programs that the whole universe watches.	[]
Stan	1	0	Television?	[]
Alien	71	0	We at Nerzod Productions started twenty billion years ago with one philosophy: the best universal television isn't scripted, it's real.  We started with great shows like, Who Wants To Marry A Gelgamek? and Antares 6 Millionaire. And then we had a big hit with Get Me Outta Here, I'm a Klingnanian. But then of course, there's our signature show. The greatest universal reality show of all time.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Earth?	[]
Alien	50	1	A few billion years ago we realized, what if we took species from all different planets in the universe, and put them together, on the same planet? Great TV, right? Asians, bears, ducks, Jews, deer and Hispanics, all trying to live side by side on one planet! It's great!	['jews']
Stan	8	0	Our planet is just a reality-TV show?	[]
Alien	50	0	Well, you don't think the whole universe works the way Earth does, do you? No! One species, one planet! There's a planet of deer, a planet of Asians, and so on! We put them all together on Earth and the whole universe tunes in to watch the fun!	[]
Kyle	22	0	You mean that you aliens actually enjoy sitting around and watching us fight and kill each other? Dude, that's messed up.	[]
Alien	1	0	Why?	[]
Stan	17	0	Why?? Because you're playing with people's lives! You're turning people's problems into entertainment!	[]
Cartman	8	0	Yeah! We'd never do that on Earth!	[]
Jeff	25	0	Ladies and Gentleman, we have recently come across an alien transmission that is being beamed throughout the entire universe.  When decoded, it looks like this.	[]
Man	4	0	What does it mean?	[]
Jeff	22	0	Ih it's simple mathematical language that can be understood throughout the solar system. Translated into our language, it looks like this.	[]
Announcer	64	0	This jannemon at eight o'clock, it's everyone's favorite show! Earth! It's been one hundred Gelganighs since we first took species from seventeen different planets and put them all together, on the same planet! Oo-derp! They've fought and fallen in love! What will happen this Galgamog? Tune in jannemon at eight to find out. It's... Earth! On Fognl!	[]
Jeff	17	0	I'm afraid that Earth, a-all of Earth, is nothing but an intergalactic reality-TV show.	[]
Man 2	5	0	My God. We're famous!	[]
Jeff	5	0	Waaaait, you don't understand!	[]
Man 3	8	0	I'm on TV! I'm on TV!	[]
Man 4	4	0	This is so awesome!	[]
Others	3	0	Woo! Yeah! Woohoo!!	[]
Alien	90	0	That should get the relay working again.  All right, Earthlings, if you'll step over this way we'll erase your memories and get you back to Earth.  Oh, excuse me.  This is Nagix. Uh huh. Oh no. Oh no, really? And it's, it's for sure? All right, I'll break the news to everyone. No, no I, I understand. Thanks.  Well, you kids can go back to Earth if you want, but I'm afraid it won't be there for long. The show's been cancelled.	[]
Kyle	4	0	What?? Who cancelled us?	[]
Nagix	21	0	The universal network heads. They say the Earthlings have become aware of the show, so it won't be funny anymore.	[]
Stan	6	1	Oh shit, did we do that?	['shit']
Nagix	26	0	Everyone, can I have your attention real quick? Uuh, look, I just got a call from the network and I'm afraid Earth has been cancelled	[]
Staff	1	0	Awww.	[]
Nagix	29	0	Now, now, it was a great run and I think we should all be really proud.  Let's call in a demolition crew to strike the Earth for resources.	[]
Stan	16	0	Wait! Wait, they they can't do this! Uh, let us talk to the network heads!	[]
Nagix	5	0	Wouldn't do any good.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Dude, we have to try!	[]
Stan	6	0	Please, take us to them! Please!	[]
Nagix	32	0	All right, kids, we'll take you to the network heads. But I warn you: nobody has ever gotten the executives to uncancel a show once the call has been made. Nobody.	[]
Chef	5	1	What the hell is that?!	['hell']
Jeff	19	0	There's a huge ship of some kind in Earth's orbit!  But why? Wait a minute! Chaos theory!	[]
Chef	2	0	Chaos theory??	[]
Jeff	29	0	Chaos theory, ih wah, it was first thought of in the sixties. Sixty. That's the number of episodes they made of Punky Brewster before it was cancelled. Cancelled...	[]
Chef	1	0	Huh?	[]
Jeff	13	0	Don't you see? The show is over! The aliens are canceling Earth!	[]
Chef	8	0	Oh my God! We have to stop them!	[]
Voice	15	0	Welcome to Planet Fognl, home of the Joozians, who control all media in the universe.	[]
Receptionist	4	0	Can I help you?	[]
Stan	13	0	Oh, uh... we have a three o'clock meeting with the network heads?	[]
Receptionist	5	0	Where are you visiting from?	[]
Stan	2	0	Uh, Earth?	[]
Receptionist	8	0	Oooo, I watch that show all the time.	[]
Joozian 1	15	0	Gaaahahaha.  Oh, sure, come on in, Earthlings. We're just checking out our new show.	[]
Joozian 2	27	0	We took a hundred beings from the planet Marklar and put them on an asteroid with sentient beings from the Horsehead Nebula. Ih-it's a riot!	[]
Joozian 1	4	0	They hate each other!	[]
Joozian 2	2	0	Gah, why?	[]
Kyle	4	0	Mighty powerful network executives,	[]
Joozian 1	9	0	Oooo, I'm starving! You Earthlings have haglar yet?	[]
Joozian 2	6	0	Oh yeah, let's do haglar.	[]
Joozian 1	7	0	Where do you wanna go? Meroni's?	[]
Joozian 2	8	0	Not on a Flakmar. Too crowded. Ohhh, Blackafelch!	[]
Joozian 1	3	0	Oh, Blackafelch. Perfect.	[]
Joozian 2	4	0	This place is fantastic!	[]
Stan	11	0	Look, we just want to talk to you about the show.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Please don't cancel us. Please.	[]
Joozian 1	15	0	Oh I'm sorry, Earthlings, but you have to realize the universe is a business.	[]
Joozian 2	12	0	You've made it to a hundred episodes, you should be proud!	[]
Joozian 1	23	0	Yeah, a show should never go past a hundred episodes, or else it starts to get stale with ridiculously stupid plotlines and settings.	[]
Waitress	6	0	Here's your order of gespahtgaplachfenachenblah.	[]
Stan	27	0	But sirs, we think our show is just getting good.  I mean, we're just now starting to see people get really pissed off at each other.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Oh my God, this is great!	[]
Joozian 1	6	0	You must have some Joozian ancestry.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Tell us about it!	[]
Stan	18	0	Look, there's five billion people on our show. You just can't up and cancel on us.	[]
Joozian 1	12	0	Oh my God! Would you look at the heglars on that joozinek?	[]
Stan	9	0	Dude, we're trying to save our planet here?!	[]
Joozian 1	8	0	Let's take the Earthlings to a hekmubah!	[]
Joozian 2	2	0	Oh, yeah!	[]
Joozian 1	7	0	Oh yeah, let's see those heglars!	[]
Stan	7	0	Sirs, uh, if you'll just let-	[]
Joozian 1	21	0	Oh, man, I am so wasted!  Hey, do you Earthlings wanna try a little glach?  Agh-oh yeah!!  Oh, gluck yeah!!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Kenny!	[]
Joozian 1	14	0	Meeh, screw this place! Let's go get a hotel room and a hooker!	[]
Joozian 2	2	0	Oh yeah!	[]
Joozian 1	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Chef	10	0	We have to find a way to stop those aliens!	[]
Jeff	16	0	Oh, their ship is massive! There's no way to stop it!  Wait a minute, jackets!	[]
Chef	2	0	Oh no.	[]
Jeff	38	0	If people don't wear jackets they could get cold. A cold is caused by a virus. A viru- a computer virus! We could make a computer virus and send it to their ships to disable their computers!	[]
Chef	8	1	That doesn't make any God-damned sense!	['damned']
Joozian 2	1	0	Ogh.	[]
Joozian 1	2	0	Oh yeah!	[]
Joozian 2	1	0	Good.	[]
Joozian 1	3	0	Oh yeah! Yeah!!	[]
Joozian 2	2	0	Woohoohoo! Yeah!	[]
Joozian 1	9	0	Booyagh! Boy, Earthlings, is this a party or what??	[]
Joozian 2	12	0	Oh! Oh, that's it baby! You're getting my jagon hard!	[]
Joozian 1	5	0	Wohh. Yeah, let's party!	[]

Joozian 1	22	0	Yeah! Now you suck on my jagon!  Oh yeah!! Stick your finger in my thrusher!  Oh yeah, suck it. Suck that jagon!	[]
Stan	21	0	Dude, I have no idea what we're seeing right now, but I have a feeling it's really, really wrong.	[]
Joozian 1	7	0	Oh yes!! Oh yeah yeahyeah! Oh yeah!	[]
Joozian 2	10	0	Oh, God. Eh eh, my head.  What did we do?	[]
Joozian 1	10	0	Oh man, I can't believe I sucked your jagon.	[]
Joozian 2	18	0	Oh God, we did suck each other's jagons! You kids won't tell anybody about this, right??	[]
Cartman	1	0	No.	[]
Stan	14	0	No, wait. We won't tell anybody, if you don't cancel our show!	[]
Joozian 1	6	0	Oooo, I knew that was coming.	[]
Joozian 2	7	0	They really got us by the nezmins	[]
