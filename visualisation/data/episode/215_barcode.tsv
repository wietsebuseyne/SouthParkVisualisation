Stephen	3	0	Well Dr. Janus?	[]
Dr. Janus	16	0	I'm afraid I have some bad news. Your son is suffering from Multiple Personality Disorder.	[]
Linda	1	0	What?	[]
Dr. Janus	31	0	There are several distinct personalities going on in there. One is named Postman Butters and yet another is Fireman Butters. And then there's even Inspector Butters and uh, Professor Chaos.	[]
Linda	3	0	Oh my God!	[]
Dr. Janus	40	0	From what I gather, he seems to mostly jump in and out of personalities when he's outside playing. Sometimes he's a cowboy and other times he's an Indian, and the two seem to be at constant odds.	[]
Linda	3	0	Oh, poor Butters!	[]
Stephen	9	0	Doctor, what can we do? Should we ground him?	[]
Dr. Janus	27	0	No, I don't think grounding him would do much good at this point.  What your son needs now is lots of tender loving... medication. Heavy medication.	[]

Dr. Janus	19	0	He's a bad man. He doesn't like Butters, does he? Does Professor Chaos want to murder Butters?	[]
Butters	6	0	What? Why would I do that?	[]
Dr. Janus	6	0	Who am I speaking to now?	[]

Butters	25	0	Thanks. I'm just glad the whole thing is over and done. Maybe now poor old Dr. Janus can finally get the help he needs.	[]
Steven	15	0	Yes Butters. Thanks to you, maybe Dr. Janus can get back to his real self.	[]
Sgt. Yates	16	0	Yes, I'm sure he could. But, then again,  does the world really need another therapist?	[]
Steven	2	0	Whattaya mean?	[]
Sgt. Yates	39	0	Well I mean, would it really be so bad for us to just let him go on thinking he's Lu Kim forever? Now that City Sushi is gone, City Wok is the only Chinese restaurant left in town.	[]
