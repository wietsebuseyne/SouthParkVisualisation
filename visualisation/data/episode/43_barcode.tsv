Kenny	11	0	(You guys, I'm gonna try and win that costume contest!)	[]

Boy in Green Shirt	1	0	BOO!	[]
"Stan, Kyle, Kenny"	1	0	Aaaaah!	[]
Boy in Green Shirt	9	0	Ha ha ha ha ha! We scared you, chickens!	[]

Boy in Green Shirt	13	0	Oh no? Well, you should be!  The pirate ghosts are gonna come getcha!	[]
Kyle	2	0	The what?	[]
Boy in Green Shirt	21	0	Didn't you know? There's an old legend in South Park that says these docks are haunted by pirate ghosts.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Nuh-uh.	[]
Boy in Green Shirt	18	0	Yuh-huh. They roam these docks with their swords and hook-hands  looking for victims tuh...  cut up!	[]

Stan	22	0	I'm sick of those fifth graders scaring us all the time! We should come up with a way to scare them!	[]
Kyle	8	0	Yeah! Let's see how they like it!	[]
DJ	24	0	Joining me now is Father Maxi, from the South Park Church. Father, what do you think of all the preparations here at the docks?	[]
Priest Maxi	12	0	Halloween is an abomination of God! A celebration of the occult-eh!	[]
DJ	13	0	Yeah, and how about KoRn playing the big concert tomorrow? Pretty exciting, huh?	[]
Priest Maxi	32	0	KoRn is a devil-worshiping group that plays violent music! If we allow that demon band to play on this most unholy of holidays, we may incur the full wrath of evil!	[]
DJ	19	0	Alriight, we'll see you tomorrow for Halloween! In the meantime  here's a KOZY hit by Barry Manilow.	[]
Stan	19	0	Come on, you guys, think! How can we scare the fifth graders? It has to be something reeaally scary.	[]
Cartman	25	0	We could get a big scary plastic spider, and dangle it in front of them on a string... s- spooky spider, that's pretty scary.	[]
Kyle	5	0	That's not scary, fatass!	[]
Stan	13	0	Well, come on! We can think of something better than stupid pirate ghosts!	[]
Pirate Ghosts	1	0	Darrrr!	[]
Jonathan	9	0	Are you sure we're goin' the right way?	[]
David	11	0	I don't know. This map doesn't make any sense.	[]
Head	10	0	That's because you've got it upside down, chowderhead!	[]
David	1	0	Oops.	[]
Fieldy	11	0	When are we gonna get to the gig? I'm starving.	[]
Jonathan	26	0	Don't think about it. We'll just keep playing our game. Ready? I spy with my little eye something that begins with the letter T!	[]
Munky	5	0	I know! A t-ree!	[]
Jonathan	17	0	You've got it. I spy with my little eye something that begins with the letter R.	[]
David	2	0	A road?	[]
Jonathan	3	0	That's it!	[]
Pirates	1	0	Darrrr!	[]
Jonathan	17	0	Okay, here's one. I spy with my little eye something that begins with the letter P.	[]
Head	3	0	The letter P?	[]
Fieldy	8	0	What the heck starts with the letter P?	[]
Jonathan	3	0	Puh-pirate ghosts!	[]
All	1	0	Aaaaah!	[]
Cartman	52	0	Mom! You got the new Duffy's catalog! I-I'm gonna circle everything I want for Christmas, okay? Mom? Okay? O-kay , let's see.  I waant... thiis... aand... this...  and...  let's see, comes with so...  ...comes with two bars , so there we go, have that...  and, let's see...	[]
Liane	6	0	Eric, your little friends are here.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Mom, mom! You wanna see what I want for Christmas?	[]
Liane	6	0	E-heric, it's only Halloween.	[]
Cartman	9	0	That's only 72 shopping days left for you!	[]
Stan	7	0	Come on, fatass, we have to go!	[]
Cartman	10	1	Ey! Don't call me fat!  Mom, don't laugh.	['fat']
Liane	4	0	I'm sorry, hon,	[]
Cartman	9	0	I can't go with you guys right now.	[]
Stan	4	0	Yes you can, porky.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Mom, seriously!	[]
Liane	13	1	Oh, that's not funny, boys. Eric isn't fat, his big-boned.	['fat']
Kyle	10	1	He must have a huge bone in his ass, then.	['ass']
Cartman	3	1	God-damnit, mom!	['damnit']
Cartman	5	0	God, I hate you guys!	[]
Stan	11	0	Okay, so we figured out how to scare the fifth graders.	[]
Cartman	1	0	How?	[]
Stan	8	0	What's the scariest thing we could get?	[]
Cartman	2	0	Spooky spider?	[]
Stan	4	0	No!  A dead body.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Yeah, fatass, a dead body.	[]
Cartman	11	0	You mean, we make something that looks like a dead body?	[]
Stan	19	0	We could never make one that looks real enough.  To be really scary, it would have to be real.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Yeah, fatass, it has to be real to be scary!	[]
Cartman	12	1	So where the hell are we going to get a dead body?	['hell']
Stan	9	0	We're gonna dig up Kyle's dead grandma.	[]
Kyle	13	0	Yeah, fatass, we're gonna dig up-  Dig up Kyle's dead grandma??	[]
Stan	12	0	Dude, she's perfect. She only died, like, three months ago, right?	[]
Kyle	3	0	Are you insane?!	[]
Cartman	8	0	U-hi think that's a sweet idea!	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Yeah!)	[]
Kyle	13	0	Dude! We're not digging up my grandma; I'll get in trouble.	[]
Stan	27	0	All we have to do is sneak in the graveyard, dig her up, scare the fifth graders, then put her back before anyone notices she's gone,	[]
Kyle	7	0	Naww, let's dig up somebody else.	[]
Stan	26	0	Relax, dude. What's the big deal? Think about it: if your grandma knew that she could help you, even in death, she would want to.	[]
Cartman	5	0	This is gonna be fun!	[]
Cartman	28	0	Just hear those sleigh bells jingle-in', ring ting tingle-in' too Outside it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you, and you, and you.	[]
Stan	19	0	Cartman, will you stop singing Christmas carols? We have to be quiet, or else we're gonna get busted!	[]
Kyle	10	0	This must be it. Cleo Broflovski That's my grandma.	[]
Stan	6	0	Well, let's dig 'er up!	[]
Kyle	9	0	Wait. I don't know if this is cool.	[]
Stan	13	0	Of course it's cool! She's gonna be all rotted and scary!	[]
Kyle	11	0	I don't think my mom would want me doin' this.	[]
Cartman	19	0	Ooh, I don't wanna dig up my dead grandma 'cause I'm such a goody-two-shoes!  Ow.	[]
Stan	16	0	You guys be quiet! Now, do you wanna get back at the fifth graders or not?!	[]
Kyle	6	0	I don't really care, dude.	[]
Stan	5	0	Yes you do! Now, dig!	[]
Cartman	11	0	Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling, You-hoo...	[]
Stan	11	0	Okay. It's almost open. Ready? One, two, three!  Whoa, dude.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Oh, my God.  Hi, ...Grandma.	[]
A voice	2	0	Hi, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Aaaah!	[]
Cartman	13	0	Have you been a good boy, Kyle? Have you been making Grandma proud?	[]
Kyle	6	1	Damnit, Cartman, that's not funny!	['damnit']
Stan	5	0	Eheh, yes, it ihis, heh.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Heh heh, I'm sweet.	[]
Kyle	14	0	Alright, alright, let's get this over with so we can put her back!	[]
Stan	4	0	Okay, grab the sled.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Silver Bells, Silver Bells, it's Christmas time in the city...	[]
Stan	28	0	Okay. Let's just hide her here, and tomorrow, during the Halloween party, we'll come back in our costumes and use her to scare the fifth graders.	[]
Kyle	10	0	How exactly are we gonna use her to scare them?	[]
Cartman	20	1	We could shove a stick up her ass and use her like a puppet: Rowr, rowr, I'm scary Grandma!	['ass']
Kyle	16	1	Alright, that does it, Cartman! That's my grandma! You show her some God-damned respect!	['damned']
Male voice	5	0	O-o-o-o-oh.	[]
Stan	3	0	Who was that?	[]
Kyle	1	0	Cartman?!	[]
Cartman	4	0	It wasn't me!	[]
Male voice	3	0	Who-o-oa.	[]
Stan	6	0	Dude, not cool. This is scary.	[]
The Boys	4	0	Wa-a-a-ah!	[]
Munky	7	0	Hey! Like, it's just some kids.	[]
Jonathan	10	0	Oh, fwooh, I was really scared there, for a second.	[]
Stan	6	0	Hay, you're that band KoRn.	[]
Jonathan	24	0	Yeah. I'm Jonathan , and this is Munky , David , Fieldy , and Head . And over there is our pal, Nibblet.  Hey, where'd Nibblet go?	[]
Nibblet	6	0	Uh-huh, Nibblet likes potato chips.	[]
KoRn	1	0	Nibblet!	[]
Nibblet	1	0	Okay.	[]
Stan	7	0	What are you guys doing out here?	[]
Head	23	0	We were just driving our van when all of a sudden we were run off the road by some super-spooky pirate ghosts.	[]
Stan	8	0	Aw, dude, that was just the fifth graders.	[]
Kyle	12	1	Yeah. They're tryin' to scare everybody 'cause they're gay wads.	['gay']
Stan	11	0	Don't worry. We're about to go get 'em back.	[]
Jonathan	16	0	Oh, swell. We're supposed to play here tomorrow. Do you know where the stage is?	[]
Stan	7	0	Yeah, dude. It's right over there.	[]
KoRn	2	0	O-kay!	[]
Jonathan	14	0	Oh, hi. We're KoRn. We're supposed to play the Halloween concert tomorrow.	[]
Priest Maxi	19	0	I know who you are and what you stand for! I think your music and Halloween is an abomination!	[]
Jonathan	9	0	Groovy! Could you show us where to set up?	[]
Stan	11	0	Alright, let's just set her over here behind these boxes.	[]
Kyle	8	0	Shouldn't we hide her better than that?	[]
Stan	34	0	Kyle, will you stop worrying? God! Now, we'll all be back here tomorrow with our costumes, and then, when the Halloween party gets going, we'll bust out dead Grandma! Let's go!	[]
Kyle	12	0	Wait till you guys see my costume! It's gonna be sweet!	[]
Kenny	10	2	(Mine is so fuckin' badass it's gotta win now!)	['fuckin', 'badass']
Cartman	18	0	Oh, come on, Kenny! You never have a sweet costume! You're not gonna win the costume contest!	[]
Kenny	28	0	(Yes I am! I've got the costume; it's waiting in the house! Yesterday I got this huge package in the mail, and it was big, okay?)	[]
Sheila	3	0	Hold on, kids.	[]
Brunet	2	0	Mrs. Broflovski?	[]
Sheila	1	0	Yes?	[]
Brunet	13	0	We're from Mt. Peaceful Cemetery. Could we have a word with you?	[]
Sheila	7	0	Eehh, sure, come in.  What is it?	[]
Brunet	9	0	Ms. Broflovski... somebody has defiled your mother's grave.	[]
Sheila	2	0	Defiled? How?	[]
Blond	9	0	Well, I'm afraid that... somebody dug her up.	[]
Sheila	4	0	Dug her up? Why??	[]
Brunet	16	1	Well. The- most likely reason is that... somebody wanted to have sex with her dead body.	['sex']
Blond	1	0	Yeahp.	[]
Sheila	1	0	What?!	[]
Brunet	22	0	Uhuh, we don't want to upset you, but it happens. Somebody's probably making love to her corpse as we speak.	[]
Blond	7	0	Every vile position, every disrespectful act imaginable.	[]
Sheila	3	0	Hoh, dear God!	[]
Brunet	19	0	Yes. By now he's probably even removed her eyes and made love to the empty sockets as well.	[]
Sheila	1	0	Oooh.	[]
Blond	41	0	No-, we don't want to upset you, but you should know that your mother's body would be stiff and dry, so he would have to have it soaked in warm water for several hours before making love to it.	[]
Sheila	5	0	O-o-o-o-oh!	[]
Brunet	7	0	Yes. And, now for the difficult part.	[]
Blond	2	0	Brace yourself.	[]
Brunet	28	0	It is highly possible that he has created new orifices in her decomposing flesh, leaving her to look something like - an overloved hunk of Swiss cheese. She probably-	[]
Sheila	16	0	Okay, okay! I get the point! Just tell me what you're gonna do about it!	[]
Brunet	1	0	...Do?	[]
Blond	11	0	Oh, we don't do anything. We're just the watchmen.	[]
Brunet	12	0	Yeah, I guess, maybe, you might wanna call the police or something.	[]
Sheila	3	0	O-o-ogh!	[]
Brunet	22	0	Now, he probably would make love to the dead body in a cool dry place, so as not to allow further decomposition.	[]
Delivery Man	5	0	Package delivery for Mrs. Cartman?	[]
Cartman	12	0	A package? Oh, really? Well, I think I can sign for that!	[]
Delivery Man	6	0	Sign heah, and heah, and heah.	[]
Cartman	63	1	I got a Christmas present! I got a Christmas present!  ...Maybe I can see what it is. I'll just open one little corner.  Let's see here.  That's good, I'll rewrap it later!  Oh, sweet! Life-sized blow-up Antonio Banderas love doll! With realistic geni-ta-lia.  Oh, this kicks ass! What a cool Christmas present my mom got!	['ass']
DJ	15	0	It's Halloween day, so come on down to the docks and bring your costumes!	[]
Stan	12	0	Where's Kenny? He said he had the best Halloween costume ever.	[]
Cartman	20	0	Nyah nyahnyahnyah nyah nyah. Guess wha-at I got? Antonio Banderas blow-up doll. You guys didn't get one.	[]
Stan	5	0	Where's your costume, fatass?	[]
Cartman	45	0	Screw Halloween, I already got my Christmas present! In a few days I'll wrap it back up, and then when I open it on Christmas, I'll act all, like, surprised, like Oh Mother, Antonio Banderas life-sized blow-up doll! What a surprise!	[]
Stan	2	0	Hey, Kenny.	[]
Kenny	10	1	(Hey, guys. Uh, check out this kick-ass cool costume.)	['ass']
Cartman	15	0	U-huh, nice costume, Kenny. If you think you're gonna win with that, huh!	[]
Stan	20	0	Alright. The fifth graders are gonna be here soon. Let's get Kyle's grandma!  This is gonna be sweet	[]
Cartman	3	0	Uuh, problem, guys.	[]
Stan	4	0	What's the problem?	[]
Cartman	2	0	Nno Grandma.	[]
Kyle	2	0	No Grandma??	[]
Cartman	2	0	Nno Grandma.	[]
Kyle	4	0	She's not here!	[]
Stan	5	0	She has to be here!	[]
Kyle	20	0	Well, she's not here! That's just great! Thanks a lot, Stan! You're gonna get me busted again!	[]
Barbrady	41	1	Okay, people. I know we all want to get down to the docks for the Halloween Haunt, but first we just need to inform you about thee- people or persons out there digging up bodies to have sex with them. Gentlemen?	['sex']
Brunet	44	2	Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. A person who steals bodies to have sex with them is called a necrophiliac. So that you all know what to expect, my partner Alan has a sketch of what having sex with a dead body might look like.	['sex', 'sex']
Crowd	2	0	Ee-oooh!	[]
Brunet	29	1	Yes, we know it's horrible. It's probably best you not look at it. Now, Alan will demonstrate what having sex with a dead body might sound like.	['sex']
Crowd	1	0	Awwwgh!	[]
Man	6	0	Excuse me, how is this helping?	[]
Barbrady	17	0	That's it, folks. Now, we can all go to the docks and enjoy the Halloween Haunt.	[]
Pirate voice	36	1	Noo! Don't go to the docks!  Aarrrgh!  Argh, I'm Captain Bly! You land-lubbers had better stay away from the docks! Or else, there'll be hell to pay!  Fire the cannon!  Har harharharhar!	['hell']
Pirate Ghost 2	1	0	Arrrgh!	[]
Captain Bly	11	0	We won't warn ya again! Stay away from our docks!	[]
Priest Maxi	30	0	I warned you! I told you this would happen!  When you allow bands like KoRn to come to town and play your hedonistic Halloween concerts, this is what you get!	[]
Jonathan	17	0	Great rehearsal, gang. That was really groovy. Let's practice one more time before the show starts.	[]
DJ	12	0	Aah, guys, I'm sorry, but the Halloween Haunt's been cancelled.	[]
Jonathan	1	0	Cancelled?	[]
DJ	15	0	You best clear out of here! There's pirate ghosts, and they'll kill you.	[]
Jonathan	11	0	Well gang, it looks like we have to pack it up.	[]
The Others	1	0	Awww.	[]
Kyle	10	2	God-damnit! Now, what the hell are we gonna do?!	['damnit', 'hell']
Munky	7	0	Oh, hey! The kids from last night.	[]
Head	11	0	Wow! Is that the Antonio Banderas life-sized blow-up doll?	[]
David	2	0	Hey, Kenny.	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Aw, man!)	[]
Jonathan	11	0	Say, what's the matter? You kids look kind of glum.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Somebody took my dead grandma.	[]
Fieldy	1	0	What?	[]
Stan	19	0	We dug her up 'cause we wanted to scare the fifth graders, but then, something took her body away.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Now she's doomed to walk the earth in limbo.	[]
Fieldy	8	0	Aw, I hate to see little clowns cry.	[]
Jonathan	22	0	Well, that does it. Somethin' funny is going on here. Your missing grandma must be connected somehow to those creepy pirate ghosts.	[]
David	10	0	They're not pirate ghosts, Jonathan, they're ghost pirates.	[]
Jonathan	1	0	Huh?	[]
David	29	0	Pirate ghost would suggest that a pirate died, and became a ghost, but a ghost pirate is a ghost that later made a conscious decision to be a pirate.	[]
Munky	14	0	No, David. Then they are pirate ghosts, because they're the ghosts of pirates.	[]
Fieldy	24	0	You're wrong, because there were no pirates in Colorado. So these must be ghosts that have decided to become pirates after the fact.	[]
Jonathan	6	0	But that makes them pirate ghosts.	[]
David	6	0	No. It makes them ghost pirates.	[]
Munky	2	0	Pirate ghosts!	[]
Head	24	0	Guys! Guys! Guys! Fighting isn't gonna solve anything. Don't you see? This is exactly what those ghost pirates want us to do.	[]
Jonathan	2	0	Pirate ghosts.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Then, you'll help us?	[]
Jonathan	22	0	Sure, we'll help you. If there's one thing we like more than playing music, it's solvin' a groovy mystery.	[]
The Boys	2	0	Al-right!	[]
Chef	3	0	Is everybody okay?	[]
Sheila	19	1	People stealing bodies to have sex with them? Pirate ghosts destroying the town? When did everything go so wrong?	['sex']
Gerald	28	0	I hate to say it, but I think Priest Maxi was right. This is what we get for celebrating Halloween and allowing that band KoRn to come play.	[]
Mr. Garrison	17	0	He's right! Nothin' ever went wrong in this town before that evil KoRn band showed up.	[]
Sharon	16	1	Well, I say we go find them and kick their devil-worshiping butts out of town!	['butts']
Crowd	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Randy	2	0	Lynch mob!	[]
Man	3	0	Down with KoRn!	[]
Jonathan	10	0	So this is where you last saw your dead grandma.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Right.	[]
Stan	11	0	Maybe there really are pirate ghosts and they took her inside.	[]
Jonathan	11	0	Alright, gang, we have to split up and look for clues.	[]
Stan	5	0	How should we split up?	[]
Jonathan	34	0	I know. Let's have everyone who enjoys having obstacles in their life, which they can overcome, go this way,  and everyone whose insecurities sabotage their potential to overcome those obstacles go that way.	[]
KoRn	2	0	O-kay!	[]
Kyle	4	0	Wow! That was easy.	[]
Randy	8	0	Here's their van! Here's their van!	[]
Woman	5	0	Let's flip it over!	[]
Some Folks	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Barbrady	26	0	Okay, people, let's try to stay orderly. The best way to do this is, all get on one side and push it from the top.	[]
Man	2	0	Devil worshipers!	[]
Crowd	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Man 2	8	0	Come on, they gotta be around here somewhere!	[]
Stan	6	0	This place gives me the creeps.	[]
Jonathan	22	0	Say, this looks like a clue.  Pirate Lore of South Park. Hmmm. Now, why would pirate ghosts need a book on pirates?	[]
Kyle	4	0	Whoa. What was that?	[]
Jonathan	9	0	The noise came from in here. Stay close, everybody!	[]
Fieldy	6	0	Oh, no! I lost my glasses.	[]
Head	7	0	What does this dead grandma look like?	[]
Cartman	10	0	Uh, she was all, like, crunchy and crispy and stuff.	[]
David	11	0	Hey, I got an idea.  We should set a groovy trap.	[]
Munky	2	0	Good idea.	[]
Cartman	9	0	How do we trap a bunch of pirate ghosts?	[]
David	19	0	We need something that might catch their eye to use as bait. I know, your Antonio Banderas love doll.	[]
Cartman	20	0	Oh, no! This is my Christmas present! If anything happens to it, my mom will know I opened it early!	[]
Munky	12	0	Come on, kid. We all have to do our part, even Antonio.	[]
Fieldy	22	0	My glasses gotta be around here somewhere.  Is that you, Jonathan? Boy, I'm glad to see you. I lost my glasses.	[]
Peg-leg	1	0	Raaarrrgh!	[]
Fieldy	6	0	Hey, you got a cold, Jonathan?	[]
Peg-leg	1	0	Raarraarrgh!	[]
Fieldy	11	0	Yeah, that sounds like a groovy song, man! Remember that one!	[]
Jonathan	5	0	Fieldy, what are you doing?!	[]
Fieldy	28	0	Oh, I was talking to you, Jonathan. ...Hey, wait a minute. If you're over there, then how could you be over here? Unless you're actually a...	[]
All	4	0	Puh-puuhh pirate ghost!	[]
Peg-leg	1	0	Raaarrrgh!	[]
David	53	0	Okay. Here's how the trap will work. When the pirate ghosts walk in, they should go right for Antonio Banderas.  When they hit the super-slippery floor, they'll slide onto this mining cart, which should travel down this path, into the next room, where the fish net will fall on them.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Wow, cool!	[]
Munky	4	0	Hey! Somebody's coming.	[]
Secure Group	1	0	Aaaaah!	[]
Stan	5	0	We've got to hide!	[]
Jonathan	11	0	Hey, there's Antonio Banderas! He'll help us.  Mr. Banderas!	[]
David	2	0	Jonathan, no!	[]
Secure group	1	0	Aaaah!	[]
Head	2	0	Oh, no!	[]
Secure group	1	0	Aaaah!	[]

David	7	0	You did it, Nibblet! You trapped them!	[]
Jonathan	20	0	Yeah. And now let's see who these pirate ghosts really are!  Oh, I guess they really were pirate ghosts.	[]
Barbrady	13	0	Alright, KoRn, you can stop your demonic shenanigans and come downtown with me!	[]

Priest Maxi	10	0	Well, what are you waiting for, Barbrady?! Arrest that band!	[]
Barbrady	1	0	Oh?	[]
Jonathan	3	0	No! Arrest him!	[]
Mob	1	0	Huh??	[]
Jonathan	9	0	I think I've got this groovy mystery solved!	[]
Chef	12	0	Well, I must say I still don't get this at all.	[]
Jonathan	23	0	It's simple. Priest Maxi didn't want there to be a Halloween, so he decided to scare everyone away from the docks.	[]
David	15	0	Yeah. And then he used this flashlight and some cotton swabs to create the ghosts.	[]
Fieldy	18	0	Then all he needed was some sound effects created by this cup and a piece of cheese.  Aaaaraargh!	[]
Jonathan	21	0	And all he had to do then was create a ghost ship, by using some candles, a mirror, and two squirrels.	[]
Chef	9	0	Father, why did you go to all this trouble?	[]
Priest Maxi	17	0	Because Halloween is an abomination of God. I would do anything to stop this wretched, unholy holiday!	[]
Chef	10	0	Including killing people and wreaking havoc all over South Park?	[]
Brunet	18	1	Don't you see that by trying to stop Halloween you've scared the hell out of everybody?	['hell']
Priest Maxi	1	0	No.	[]
Barbrady	6	0	Okay buddy, you can explain downtown!	[]

Man	2	1	Ho-hoh.	['ho']
Chef	13	0	Well thanks a lot, KoRn! You KoRn powers really came through for us!	[]
Sharon	14	0	Yes! We were wrong about you. Will you please play for our Halloween party?	[]

Mob	2	0	All right!	[]
Pirate Voice	1	0	Raarrrr!	[]
Stan	7	0	Oh, no! The pirate ghosts are back!	[]
All	1	0	Nibblet!	[]
Nibblet	2	0	Uh oh!	[]
Jonathan	83	0	Well, this sure has been a wacky night, but me and the gang learned a lot, and we hope you did too. You all perceived us to be mean, evil people, but, really, we're just normal guys. And we all perceived pirate ghosts to be real when, actually, they were just cotton swabs. So I guess the lesson is: it's easy to perceive somethin' someway, and then be wrong. So we all need to learn to be a little less perceptive.	[]
All	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Jonathan	26	0	The gang and I wrote a song about it, and it goes goes a little somethin' like this:And a-one, and-a-two, and a	[]
