Cartman	60	1	YOU said I had to wait till my birthday to get an iPad! So the one I rubbed in everyone's faces today isn't real and tomorrow everyone's gonna call me a liar.

Kyle	20	0	You see? And then I can take all my homework on my iPad, and swipe it over to my iPhone.	[]
Man	24	0	Oh. Yeah, Apple's stuff is pretty neat alright. I just don't want any big company tracking where I am at all times.	[]

Kyle	2	0	What agreement?!	[]
Apple Man 1	8	0	83 pounds, good. Let's get the bloodwork.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Hey! You can't do that!	[]
Apple Man 1	10	0	You agreed we could take all the blood we needed.	[]
Kyle	5	0	What are you talking about?!	[]
Apple Man 1	37	0	When you downloaded the last iTunes update a window on your screen popped up and asked you if you agreed to our terms and conditions. You clicked Agree. Alright, let's get him to the water tank.	[]
Kyle	10	0	The water tank?   Hey I'm not going with you!	[]
Apple Man 1	8	0	You've agreed to all of this!  Hey!	[]
Kyle	16	0	You guys!  You gotta help me. These business casual G-men are trying to kidnap me!	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Kyle	20	0	It's crazy, dude! They're saying it's because I agreed to the latest terms and conditions on iTunes!	[]
Stan	12	0	Why? What did the terms and conditions for the last update say?	[]
Kyle	9	0	I don't know, I didn't read them!	[]
Butters	5	0	You didn't read them?	[]
Kyle	12	1	Who the hell reads that entire thing every time it pops up?	['hell']
Stan	2	0	I do.	[]
Clyde	2	0	Me too.	[]
Kyle	21	0	You're telling me that every time you guys download an update for iTunes, you read the entire terms and conditions?	[]
Jimmy	2	0	Of course.	[]
Butters	16	0	Well, how do you know if you agree to something if you don't read it?	[]
Kyle	22	0	Well, I turned off all my Apple stuff. They can't locate you if you don't have your stuff on, right?	[]
Apple Man 1	5	0	There he is. Hey you!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Gahhh!	[]
Kyle	6	0	Dad! Dad, I need a lawyer!	[]
Gerald	6	0	Kyle? What are you doing here?	[]
Kyle	19	0	Dad, if you agree to something but you didn't mean to agree to it, what do you do?!	[]
Gerald	16	0	Well, Kyle, it's always the agreeing party's responsibility to know what they are signing.	[]
Kyle	24	0	But it's like eight pages long and they send me a new one like every three weeks! How can they know if I-	[]
Gerald	11	0	Calm down, Kyle! It's okay. You're safe with Daddy.	[]
Apple Man 1	3	0	Here he is!	[]
Kyle	1	0	AAHH!	[]
Apple Man 1	3	0	Come on you!	[]
Gerald	7	0	Hey, what the heck is going on?	[]
Apple Man 1	12	0	Your son has made a binding and legal agreement with Apple, sir.	[]
Gerald	5	0	An agreement to do what?!	[]
Apple Man 1	15	0	Apple's inner workings are top secret to all users. You know how it is.	[]
Gerald	12	0	No, I don't know how it is. I use a PC.	[]
Apple Man 1	2	0	You what?	[]
Apple Man 4	5	0	Come on, let's go!	[]

Cartman	9	0	Okay, WiFi+3G, 64 gigs. This one, this one!	[]
Liane	3	0	Oh, sweetie, $900?	[]
Cartman	23	0	I can't wait to see the look on Kyle's stupid face when he sees my iPad has more memory than his!	[]
Liane	7	0	Eric, we can't afford that one.	[]
Cartman	16	0	Well you don't expect me to get the WiFi-only 16-gig version, do you?	[]
Liane	16	0	I think we need to get you a different brand, hon. They're a little cheaper.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Mom, everyone knows that everything but Apple is stupid!	[]
Liane	8	0	Here, look at this one. A Toshiba Handibook.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Toshiba Handibook??	[]
Liane	12	0	This says it does everything the iPad does, at half the price.	[]
Cartman	24	1	Mom, do not screw me over again! If I take that thing to school, everyone is gonna think I'm a poverty-stricken asshole!	['asshole']
Liane	21	0	Eric, stop acting like a spoiled brat! You can either have the Toshiba Handibook or you can have nothing at all!	[]
Cartman	33	2	Oh, I've got a better idea! Why don't you go across the street and buy some condoms?! Because we should at least be safe if you're gonna fuck me, Mom!	['condoms', 'fuck']
Liane	1	0	Eric!	[]
Cartman	62	7	You might as well go buy some cigarettes too, because I like to have a smoke after I get good and fucked! Do you wanna fuck me Mom?!  Just say so! Go ahead! Here!  Huh?! Go ahead, Mom! Fuck me! Fuck me right here in the Best Buy! You wanna fuck your son so bad?! Go on Mom! Fuck me! Fuck me!	['fucked', 'fuck', 'fuck', 'fuck', 'fuck', 'fuck', 'fuck']
Liane	16	0	Stop crying, Eric! I told you if you kept acting up, you weren't getting anything!	[]
Cartman	7	0	But I told you I was sorry.	[]
Liane	16	1	You made me look like some sort of child molester in front of all those people!	['molester']
Cartman	9	0	I wasn't trying to get you in trouble.	[]
Liane	21	1	Then why did you go outside to a police officer and say Help! Help! My mommy is trying to fuck me!?	['fuck']
Cartman	27	0	Oh wait, I get it now! The F-word is a no-no word, and I shouldn't say it around other people. I'm sorry Momma.	[]
Liane	15	0	If you're really sorry, then you'll understand why you aren't getting anything!	[]
Cartman	34	0	Well, now that doesn't really have any logical sense, Mommy, because I'm already being punished by not getting the iPad. Mama. Please, can we just go back and get the Toshiba Handibook?	[]
Liane	1	0	No!	[]
Cartman	26	1	Well then can we at least pull up here and get some dinner? 'Cause I like to be wined and dined after I've been FUCKED!	['fucked']
Woman	8	0	What are you going to do to us??	[]
Kyle	7	0	What is this? What's going on?	[]
Woman	10	0	You... You agreed to the iTunes terms and conditions too??	[]
Kyle	1	0	...What?	[]
Woman	28	0	I just clicked Agree. I didn't read it! I was in a hurry, you see, and I, I, I didn't know what I was agreeing to!	[]
Junichi	9	0	(In Japanese Accent) I can't even read Engrish!	[]
Guard	11	0	Hey, shut up in there! You all agreed to stay quiet!	[]
Kyle	15	0	Hey! Hey, let me out of here! This is a mistake! I agreed by accident!	[]
Guard	39	0	You can't agree by accident. There's a fail-safe built in. Even if you click on Agree another little window pops up that says Are you sure you agree? and you have to click on Agree again.	[]
Woman	9	0	Uh, what are you going to do to us??	[]
Guard	9	0	Everything that you agreed to in the iTunes conditions.	[]
Kyle	5	0	We didn't read them!	[]
Guard	11	0	Heh! Riiight. Who just agrees to something they don't read?	[]
Announcer	8	0	And now, the president of Apple, Steve Jobs!	[]
Steve Jobs	54	0	Hello everyone, I'm here to announce a new product that will once again revolutionize the way we use our phones and tablet devices. Let's hear it for our volunteers!

Kyle	3	0	The first what?	[]
Steve Jobs	22	1	They have actually agreed to be surgically altered.  Their lips will be removed and they will be sewn together mouth to anus.	['anus']
Woman	1	0	What??	[]
Steve Jobs	86	2	You agreed to this!  Mouth to anus so that the feces so that the gastral tract from one will enter the mouth of the little boy -  and he agreed this was okay - enter the mouth of the little boy, leading through his anus to the mouth of the female - who completely agreed; they all agreed - which will then go to a tablet device, making a product that is part human, and part centipede, and part Web browser, and part emailing device! I give you... the HUMANCENTiPad!	['anus', 'anus']
Junichi	10	0	(In Japanese Accent) Oho... I should habu never appudeitedo iTunes!	[]
Butters	20	0	You agree that Apple may charge your credit card or Paypal account for any products purchased in the iTunes store.	[]
Gerald	10	0	Can somebody please explain to me what is going on?!	[]
Stan	11	0	We're trying to find out exactly what Kyle agreed to.	[]
Gerald	21	0	There can't be anything in that agreement that allows a company to do what they're talking about to Kyle!	[]
Butters	27	1	Hold up. Here it is right here: by clicking Agree, you are also acknowledging that Apple may sew your mouth to the butthole of another iTunes user	['butthole']
Stan	2	0	Oh boy.	[]
Butters	33	1	Apple and its subsidiaries may also, if necessary, sew yet another person's mouth onto your butthole, making you a being that shares one gastral tract. Hmmm, I'm gonna click onnn... Decline.	['butthole']
Gerald	10	0	Well that does it! I'm going to the police!	[]
Stan	2	0	For what?	[]
Gerald	9	0	To find out where Apple is keeping my son!	[]
Stan	42	0	Dude, when the police wanna know where somebody is, they ask Apple! The only way we can fix all this is by going to the highest authority on the planet! Yo guys, we're gonna have to ask help from... the Geniuses.	[]
Butters	2	0	The Geniuses...	[]
Kenny	2	0	(The Geniuses...)	[]
Steve Jobs	7	0	Alright. Good. Looks good, guys. Great work.	[]
Junichi	3	0	Nanda... Nanda kore?!	[]
Steve Jobs	62	2	Really nice, guys.  I remember when the first version of the iPad came out. People couldn't believe how easy it was to take their videos, music, and photos, and all their shit,  and share it, with other people, who could do the same with all their shit. The only thing the iPad couldn't do was walk or read. Until now.	['shit', 'shit']
Kyle	9	0	(I need some help! I can't take it!)	[]
Steve Jobs	11	0	What, what what's that? What's that you're saying?	[]
Kyle	10	0	(I can't take it! I want out right now!)	[]
Steve Jobs	10	0	Yeah you want out? Are you saying you want out?	[]
Kyle	5	0	(Yes! Please! Let me go!)	[]
Steve Jobs	46	1	Fine. You don't want to be part of this? Then just sign right here.  Nooo! You didn't read it! This says we don't ever have to let you out and that we can do whatever we want!  Dammit, why won't it read?!	['dammit']
Apple Tech	10	0	It's probably low on power. We should feed it.	[]
Steve Jobs	6	0	Alright. Here you go, come on.	[]
Junichi	16	1	(In Japanese Accent) Nooo!  I will not eat if they are forced to iito my poo!	['poo']
Steve Jobs	15	0	Perhaps I didn't mention...  it's a bean and cheese burrito from Paco's.	[]

Audience	1	0	Awwwwww!	[]
Cartman	22	1	You know, Mom, the least you could do is kiss me first. 'Cause I liked to be kissed before I get fucked!	['fucked']
Man 1	14	1	You fuck your son and you won't even give him a kiss? Booooooo!	['fuck']
Man 2	12	1	If I was gonna fuck my son, I'd kiss him first!	['fuck']
Dr. Phil	12	0	Well Eric, we have a very special gift we wanna give you.	[]
Cartman	2	0	An iPad???	[]
Announcer	2	0	Gerald Broflovski.	[]
Stan	33	0	Okay, the Geniuses will see us now.  Now remember: when you speak to the Geniuses keep your questions short and to the point. The Geniuses do not like those who waste their time.	[]
Leslie	10	0	Hi, my name is Leslie. I'll be your Genius.	[]
Stan	11	0	Genius Leslie, we have a problem and we seek your wisdom.	[]

Gerald	12	0	No I don't want store credit, I want my son back!	[]
Frothgar	18	0	'Kay, this says he agreed to be taken and made part of any experiments Apple wants to perform.	[]
Stan	14	0	Yeah, but it's all a mistake. He actually didn't read the agreement.	[]
Frothgar	5	0	He didn't read it?	[]
Butters	5	0	We know. It's preposterous.	[]
Frothgar	1	0	Hrrrrgh.	[]
Leslie	6	0	Sooo, just give them store credit?	[]
Junichi	29	0	Aarrrgh. Dame kore!  (In Japanese Accent) So sori Kairu, but I am starving! Which would you rather I eat? Should I iito cuttlefish and asparagus, or the vanilla peisuto?	[]

Leslie	1	0	Okay.	[]
Field Reporter	49	1	Tom, it's a big exciting day for Mac Apple users: the unveiling of the first HumancentiPad. As part of a clear PR stunt, Apple has joined up with Best Buy and Dr. Phil to donate the first centiPad to a needy boy who was raped by his mother.	['raped']
Dr. Phil	35	0	In all my years I've never heard a more tragic story than that of Eric Cartman,  and I wanna thank the Apple company for helping us make today a very special day for him.	[]
Crowd	1	0	Yaaaaaaaaay!	[]
Best Buy President	25	1	As as president of Best Buy, Eric,  I want to assure you that a child will never get fucked in one of our stores again.	['fucked']
Crowd	1	0	Yaaaaaaaaay!	[]

Cartman	30	1	Whoa! Cooool!  Oh wooow! No waaay!  It does e-mail and Web browsing, and it shits in Kyle's mouth?? This is the greatest thing that has ever been invented!!	['shits']
Reporter 1	5	0	Yes but, can it read?	[]
Steve Jobs	21	0	Don't worry. It took a while, but I'm pretty sure it has finally learned to read, hasn't it?!	[]
Kyle	6	0	(Yes. I promise I'll read.)	[]
Crowd	1	0	Hooraaaaaaaaay!	[]
Gerald	7	1	What the hell are they doing now?!	['hell']
Butters	11	0	The Geniuses are performing the Toran Ra. It's future stuff.	[]
Gerald	23	1	Alright, that's it! I've had about enough with iCrap, and me clouds, and a council of Geniuses, with all their future-	['icrap']
Leslie	23	0	It's okay, sir. The Toran Ra has revealed the answer to your problem. We can retroactively make your son's agreement invalid.	[]
Gerald	7	0	Okay! Finally! How do we do that?	[]
Leslie	11	0	It's very easy. You will simply need to join Apple.	[]
Gerald	11	0	Nooo! I don't wanna join Apple, I like my PC!	[]
Leslie	24	0	But if you join we can make your son's account into a family account, and then you have to iApprove all his agreements.	[]
Stan	23	0	Come on, it's not that big a deal. Will you just stop resisting and join the rest of us in the future?	[]
Gerald	9	0	Ugh... Alright, fine! I'll sign up with Apple.	[]
Leslie	2	0	Kali fi!	[]
Leslie	14	0	Gerald Broflovski, do you agree to let Apple track your location at all times?	[]

Gerald	2	0	I agree.	[]
Leslie	16	0	Do you agree to care about your membership, and prove that you care by purchasing AppleCare?	[]
Cartman	9	0	Hehe heh, heh heh heh. Dude, HumancentiPad is awesome!	[]
Staffer	6	0	Sir! Sir, we have a problem!	[]
Steve Jobs	18	0	What? What do you mean we have to take it apart?! The boy's agreement isn't valid?	[]
Staffer 2	6	0	Sorry, we have to recall this.	[]
Cartman	5	0	What?! Hey, that's mine!	[]
Steve Jobs	17	1	I don't care what the Geniuses say! Dammit, I'm trying to create the future here!	['dammit']
Gerald	73	0	We are all trying to create the future!  I'm part of the future now too. I have sat with the Council of Geniuses, performed the Toran Ra, and I've even been to me. Mr. Jobs, you have done so much for the world. You have helped connect everyone to each other.  Clearly, this is the future. But... but can't we just slow down and enjoy the present... a little longer?	[]
Steve Jobs	5	0	You know something? I agree.	[]
Crowd	1	0	Awww.	[]
Steve Jobs	21	0	Come on. We'll get you separated, little boy.  Guess you won't be eating Japanese food for a while, huh?	[]
Cartman	84	2	Hey! Hey, what is this?! Some sort of sick prank?! I get the greatest thing ever just to have it taken away?! Why did you do this to me, God? Next time you're gonna get my hopes up, could you please take me to a grease monkey? 'Cause I like to get lubed before I get FUCKED! Huh?! Some lube would be nice! Or at least a courtesy lick, God! How about a little courtesy lick next time you decide to FUCK me!	['fucked', 'fuck']
