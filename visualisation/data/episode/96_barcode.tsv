Cartman	3	0	You're done?	[]
Kyle Schwartz	22	0	Ye-yes, I-I've tallied up all the times you've been naughty and deducted the times you've been nice.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Yeah, so how's it look?	[]
Kyle Schwartz	11	0	It doesn't look good, Eric. It doesn't look good.	[]
Cartman	10	0	But I'll still be getting presents this year, right?	[]
Kyle Schwartz	16	0	a-a-aactually it looks like you're gonna owe Santa three hundred and six presents.	[]
Cartman	1	0	What?!	[]
Kyle Schwartz	19	0	Four thousand three hundred and twelve instances of being naughty against three deductions of being nice, is, is bad.	[]
Cartman	15	0	Three?? You didn't deduct all my nice invoices! Look look! What about this one?	[]
Kyle Schwartz	18	1	Yes, wa-a-I didn't think hitting Clyde in the balls with slingshot really counted as nice.	['balls']
Cartman	11	0	It was nice for Token; he laughed for like 20 minutes.	[]

Kyle Schwartz	17	0	Hey hey,  I'm just your naughty-and-nice accountant! Don't blame me for the numbers!	[]
Cartman	40	0	Haven't you seen the Haibo doll? It's like a pet, a robot pet. You have to feed it and pet it or else it dies, and it's the coolest thing ever! Santa has to bring me one!	[]
Kyle Schwartz	19	0	But what, look, aren't there any other nice things you've done recently we can write off here?	[]
Cartman	8	0	Uh... Oh! I brushed my teeth last night!	[]
Kyle Schwartz	22	0	Eh... brushing your teeth isn't naughty or nice... Eric, it just, it falls more into the category of... brushing your teeth.	[]
Cartman	15	0	Well there's still time before Christmas! Can't I still make up for it?	[]
Kyle Schwartz	14	0	If you cure cancer... and AIDS next week, you would still owe two presents.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Jesus Christ!	[]
Kyle Schwartz	23	0	Ah I'm afraid you're gonna have to find a way to do... the nicest, greaatest thing anyone has ever done. Ever.	[]

Cartman	12	0	I'm just letting you know how special you are to me.	[]
Mayor McDaniels	60	0	But now, before we light the tree, I think we should all reflect for a moment on those who are less fortunate than us.  Right now in Iraq there are children who fear us and what we might do to their country. The threat of war touches us all, but over in Iraq, there is no Christmas. They have nothing.	[]

Mr. Hankey	13	0	Gee whiz, things sure look Christmasy out here. What are you boys doin'?	[]
Kyle	8	0	Cartman is trying to bring Christmas to Iraq.	[]
Cartman	12	0	The people of Iraq deserve a good Christmas just like everyone else.	[]
Mr. Hankey	19	0	Well, gosh, Eric, looks like you really have the Christmas spirit!  I know someone who can help. Santa Claus!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Really?	[]
"Stan, Kyle"	1	0	Really?	[]
Mr. Hankey	10	0	Sure. We should take this stuff to him right away!	[]
Kyle	10	0	But how are we gonna get to the North Pole?	[]
Mr. Hankey	18	1	Oh, that's no problem! We just need a little Christmas magic.  All aboard the Poo Choo Express!	['poo']
Cartman	1	0	Wow!	[]
Stan	3	0	Wuh, that smells.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Mr. Hankey	5	0	Next stop, the North Pole!	[]
Cartman	8	0	Get the rest of the stuff you guys!	[]
Stan	9	0	Uh, I don't really wanna get on there.	[]

Cartman	6	0	Wow, is that where Santa lives?	[]
Mr. Hankey	8	0	That's it. Santa's Fortress of Solitude.	[]
Gnome 1	2	0	Mr. Hankey!	[]
Mr. Hankey	11	0	We need to see Santa right away on urgent Christmas business.	[]
Gnome 1	2	0	Sure thing!	[]
Kyle	8	0	Hey. Aren't you guys the underpants gnomes?	[]
Gnome 1	17	0	Ten months out of the year. But this time of year we help Santa!  Here he is!	[]

Santa	5	0	Mr. Hankey, how are you?	[]
Mr. Hankey	4	0	All ready for Christmas?	[]
Santa	18	0	I was just starting to look over the new naughty and nice list the gnomes prepared for me.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Oh, heh. Are the uh tabulations all closed up then?	[]
Santa	26	0	Oh no, they keep it open until midnight of Christmas Eve. Some kids actually try to cram in a lot of niceness right at the end.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Oh, that's so lame of them.	[]
Mr. Hankey	15	0	Santa, my friends are trying to do something very special this Christmas. Tell him, Eric.	[]
Cartman	44	0	Well Santa, it's just that... I was thinking about the people in Iraq who are afraid that we might bomb them and I just thought, well, maybe it wouldn't hurt to send them a little bit of our Christmas spirit as well.	[]
Santa	27	0	You know you're right. Santa hasn't been to that of the world in a looong time. Perhaps Santa could bring peace to this whole situation.	[]
Cartman	5	0	That's what I thought.	[]
Santa	15	0	Gnomes!  Load up the sleigh with toys! Santa's going to make a special run!	[]
Mr. Hankey	2	0	All right!	[]
Santa	12	0	And you boys can all watch me from our flight control room.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Hooray!	[]
Jimmy	28	0	...and a par-tridge in a... p...pear tree. On the ...fourth day of C...C...Ca...Chriiiistmas my t-true love g-ge-gave to me-mee.	[]
Gnome 1	22	0	This is Santa's flight control center. From here, we can monitor Santa from satellite as he travels the globe delivering presents.	[]

Cartman	10	0	Now I'm never gonna get my Haibo robot doll!	[]
Kyle	21	0	Is that what this is all about?!  You came up with this whole idea so you could get a stupid toy?!	[]
Cartman	24	0	It's not stupid! It's a toy that you can starve! If you don't feed it, it dies. It's sooo cool.	[]
Stan	23	1	Well good going, asshole! Thanks to you, there's not gonna be any Christmas, and there's no one left to help us!	['asshole']

Cartman	11	0	Come on, gang, it's up to us to save Christmas!	[]
Mr. Hankey	16	0	Tell Santa's workers to keep making toys. We'll have Santa back in no time!	[]
Kyle	9	0	Uhhh, how d- how do we start this thing?	[]
Gnome 2	10	0	You just have to call out the reindeer's names.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Oh yeah! On Dasher, on Prancer, on Comet-	[]

Cartman	13	0	I'm having a precious Christmastime moment, Kyle, if you don't mind.	[]
Kyle	27	0	Singing a Christmas song isn't gonna get you nice deductions, Cartman! Don't forget: it's because of you that Santa's sleigh got shot down!	[]
Cartman	12	0	Hey, it isn't my fault that Iraqis are filled with hate!	[]
Kyle	19	0	All I'm saying is that it's gonna take a lot of singing to make up for that!	[]
