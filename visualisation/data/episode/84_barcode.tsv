Ms. Choksondik	18	0	Okay children, step off the bus and form a group next to the nice redneck - I mean, rancher.	[]
Rancher	9	0	Hello, boys and girls. My name is Rancher Bob.	[]
Ms. Choksondik	8	0	Let's all say hello to Rancher Bob.	[]
Kids	3	0	Hi, Rancher Bob.	[]
Rancher Bob	14	0	I'm pleased to show you all the wonderful world of beef. Follow me.	[]
Kyle	14	0	City kids get to go to museums for field trips. We get cow farms.	[]
Rancher Bob	25	0	Now, out here you can see our cattle. This is where the magic begins as the cows eat and sleep and prepare for certain death.	[]
Cartman	4	0	They look so delicious.	[]
Rancher Bob	17	0	Now here we have the slaughterhouse. This is where we turn the cows into steaks and burgers.	[]
Kids	1	0	Eewwww!!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Aw, dude.	[]
Rancher Bob	6	0	Hey, anybody want a free sample?	[]
Cartman	1	0	Memememee!	[]
Rancher Bob	45	0	And in here, boys and girls, we have our...  veal ranch.  You see, with veal the whole key is keepin' the cows chained so they can't walk around or get any exercise. That way, their muscle tissue stays soft, and makes for tender veal.	[]
Stan	8	0	Wait a minute. Veal is... little baby cows??	[]
Rancher Bob	1	0	Yeppir.	[]
Kyle	9	1	Then why the hell do they call it veal??	['hell']
Rancher Bob	13	0	Well, if we called it little baby cow people might not eat it.	[]
Stan	5	0	Yeah, I wouldn't have.	[]
Butters	3	0	Huh, me neither.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Oh, man, look at that one!  It looks delicious	[]
Kyle	1	0	What??	[]
Cartman	13	0	Mm, succulent and juicy.  Can we have a free sample of these, too?	[]
Rancher Bob	30	0	Well, no, but all these veals are goin' to the slaughterhouse tomorrow mornin'. They'll be steaks by tomorrow afternoon and then you can buy them at your grocery store.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Alriiight!	[]
Stan	7	0	Tomorrow morning?  Dude, we gotta help them.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Stan	2	0	Pst, Cartman.	[]
Cartman	4	0	No, Uncle Jesse, no!	[]
Stan	3	0	Cartman, wake up!	[]
Cartman	8	1	What? What the hell are you guys doing??	['hell']
Kyle	6	0	Come on, we've gotta go!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Where are we going?	[]
Stan	11	0	We're gonna go to save the little baby cows, fatass!	[]
Cartman	2	0	What? Why?	[]
Kyle	8	1	'Cause they're gonna get slaughtered tomorrow, butthole!	['butthole']
Cartman	1	0	So?	[]
Stan	16	1	So we can't let 'em die, douchebag! You're our friend; now come help us!	['douchebag']
Cartman	27	2	Well, lessee, in the last three point two seconds you've called me fatass, butthole, and douchebag. I really don't feel like you guys's friend.	['butthole', 'douchebag']
Stan	17	0	We're sorry, you are our friend. We need you to help us because friends stick together.	[]
Butters	19	0	Uh-wait. I thought... yoyou said we needed him because he has the Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset.	[]
Stan	6	1	Damnit Butters, will you shut up?!	['damnit']
Cartman	13	0	Oho! So you indeed me and my Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset!	[]
Stan	15	0	Yes we do. We're those little baby cows' only hope. Will you help us?	[]
Cartman	11	1	Yes. Yes I will. If Kyle will kiss my black ass.	['ass']
Kyle	1	0	What?!	[]
Cartman	10	0	Just give it a little kiss and I'll help.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Screw you, Cartman!	[]
Cartman	18	0	Hokay, but if you want my help you have to give it just a little kiss.  Kiss it.	[]
Stan	8	0	Go on, dude it's the only way.	[]
Kyle	1	0	No!	[]
Cartman	6	0	Kiss it. Come on.  Kiss it.	[]
Stan	9	0	Just do it really fast, and we can go.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Have Butters kiss it.	[]
Cartman	6	0	No, it has to be Kyle.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Awww!	[]
Cartman	6	0	Oh man, that was soho awesome!	[]
Kyle	7	0	Sick! I felt it on my face!	[]
Stan	7	0	Okay, very funny Cartman, now come on!	[]
Cartman	7	1	Hell, I'm not goin' with you!	['hell']
Kyle	1	0	Hyaaaa!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Heeeey!	[]
Butters	34	0	Oh I don't know about this, fellas. It says right here on the Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset: Not for actual breaking and entereing. B-breaking and entering is a cr-riime.	[]
Stan	18	0	Yeah, well killing little helpless baby cows should be a crime, too!  How does this thing work, Cartman?	[]
Cartman	27	0	Jesus, don't you guys have any toys? First you put on the black ski mask  and use the torch to cut a hole in the roof.	[]
Stan	11	0	Okay, that's far enough. I'm going to go delta.	[]
Cartman	17	0	You have to talk louder. I forgot the double-A batteries for the SuperTalk play-action headset.	[]
Stan	34	0	I said that's far enough!  Don't be scared, little baby cow. We're here to set you loose.  There you go. You're free. Run away!  Go! They're gonna murder you.	[]
Cartman	12	1	Stan, could you hurry it up? I'm freezing my ass off.	['ass']
Kyle	9	1	You need to freeze some of your ass off.	['ass']
Cartman	8	2	O! At least I have as ass, Jew!	['ass', 'jew']
Kyle	1	0	What?	[]
Stan	13	0	Come on, you stupid baby cows!  You have to get out of here.	[]
Butters	5	0	Huuh what's the matter?	[]
Stan	4	0	They aren't leaving.	[]
Cartman	10	0	See? Maybe they want to become sweet juicy veal steaks.	[]
Kyle	15	0	Hey. They've never been allowed to walk before. They just don't know how.	[]
Stan	32	0	Oh yeah, they're too weak to move.  Well, we've gotta get 'em out of here. We'll just keep them at Butters' house until they can get their strength back.	[]
Butters	17	0	No no no no no! I can't bring cows into my house. I'll get grounded.	[]
Stan	18	0	Okay, fine Butters! I guess you're not a team player! We'll bring them to my house.	[]
Kyle	12	0	Dude! How are we gonna move twenty three calves to your house?	[]
Stan	4	0	I don't know.	[]
Cartman	18	0	I've got it. We could kill Butters, and then float the calves on a river of blood.	[]
Kyle	14	0	Don't be stupid, Cartman! Butters doesn't have that much blood in him!	[]
Butters	5	0	Eh yeah I do too!	[]
Stan	15	0	We're just gonna have to carry them one by one.  Come on, you guys.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Eh!	[]
Cartman	9	0	Check it out, you guys. I'm calf-curling.	[]
Cartman	21	1	Man, these calves smell like crap! I don't see how you're gonna hide them from your mom much longer.	['crap']
Stan	24	0	We won't have to. Butters said he has something in his house that makes baby cows strong again. He's bringing it over.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Butters has that at his house?	[]
Butters	2	0	Hey fellas!	[]
Stan	5	0	Butters!  Did you bring it?	[]
Butters	15	0	I sure did. We'll have those poor baby cows in shape in no time!	[]
Kyle	2	0	All right!	[]
Butters	4	0	Susanne Sommers' Calf Exerciser.	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Butters	8	0	Makes your calves stronger in just - two days!	[]
Kyle	7	1	Oh, God-damnit! That's your plan?	['damnit']
Butters	16	0	Eh, you thnk it's a gimmick? Susanne promises right on the box that it works.	[]
Officer Barbrady	3	0	Hello, Mr. Marsh.	[]
Sharon	8	0	Officer Barbrady. What can I do for you?	[]
Officer Barbrady	25	0	Well, we've got a little problem. Gent here caught your boy and his friends trespassing on his ranch. They stole some of his property.	[]
Sharon	6	0	Stole? A-a-are you sure?	[]
Rancher Bob	12	0	I followed a calf-curling path right to your house, ma'am.	[]
Shelly	11	1	Ooo, Stan's in trouble. Let me kick his ass, Mom.	['ass']
Sharon	23	0	Not now - my son is not a thief. I'm sure this is just some kind of a misunderstanding.  Stanley, did you see-?	[]
Stan	2	1	Aw crap!	['crap']
Sharon	8	0	Stanley, what are you doing with those calves?	[]
Stan	11	1	That asshole is gonna kill them and feed them to people!	['asshole']
Randy	5	0	Stanley, they belong to him.	[]
Stan	16	0	They don't belong to anybody! Please Mom, we don't want these calves to die.	[]
Shelly	5	0	Let me hit him, Mom!	[]
Sharon	36	0	Stanley, this isn't up for discussion. The rancher is gonna take his cows back and  you don't have a choice!  Stanley! Stanley, you open this door right now or you're gonna get it!	[]
Stan	1	0	No!	[]
Randy	7	0	Stan, you're behaving like a kid!	[]
Stan	28	0	You're the ones who made me eat veal without telling me what it was! You're the one who know we were making little baby animals suffer!	[]
Sharon	4	0	Open this door, now!	[]
Stan	3	1	Kiss my ass!	['ass']
Butters	8	1	Oh Jeez, he said ass to his parents.	['ass']
Kyle	7	0	You're getting in pretty deep, dude.	[]
Sharon	7	0	I apologize for this, Mr. rancher person.	[]
Rancher Bob	25	0	Oh, why, why don't you just tell them that the cows will be safe. And when they come out I can take them back.	[]
Sharon	24	0	I can't lie to my son, okay? If I betrayed him like that, I'd pay for it the rest of my life.	[]
Rancher Bob	34	0	Well that's just too bad. Look it, that's eight hundred dollars' worth of veal up there and I have to ship it out Friday. What are you goin' to do, Officer Barbrady?	[]
Officer Barbrady	8	0	Me?? How did I get into this mess?	[]
Kyle	4	0	So what happens now?	[]
Stan	20	0	I'm gonna lock myself in here with these cows until we have a guarantee of their safety, in writing.	[]
Kyle	5	0	We're with you, dude.	[]
Butters	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Stan	51	0	Don't be so sure. Because I'm gonna tell you: this is gonna get ugly. Real ugly. When all is said and done you could all be looking at being grounded for three, perhaps even four weeks. So if any of you guys want out, just say the word now.	[]
Cartman	3	0	I want out.	[]
Stan	3	0	Shut up, Cartman.	[]
Kyle	5	0	We're with you, Stan.	[]
Butters	24	0	Hey y-yeah. W-w-we can't let those little baby cows down. Why, they've got no one else to turn to.	[]
Stan	13	0	Then it's settled. One for all and all for one! Except Cartman.	[]
"Kyle, Butters"	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Cartman	3	0	Yeah! Wait-what?	[]
Sharon	27	0	And so that's the situation. Our boys have locked themselves in Stan's room until we can promosie them the calves will live free, in writing.	[]
Sheila	22	0	Well, this is ridiculous! I don't know how you raise your kids, but my son does not play negotiator with me!	[]
Sharon	10	0	We excuse me, Sheila, but it wasn't that simple!	[]
Sheila	26	0	HA! Give me fifteen seconds with Kyle and I'll have that door open!  Kyle?!  This is your mother! You will open this door right now!	[]
Kyle	4	0	...No I won't.	[]
Sharon	11	0	Yes, I see what you mean, Sheila.  That was very impressive.	[]
Sheila	17	0	Kyle, if you don't do as you're told, I'm going to be very angry!	[]
Kyle	25	1	Well you made me eat veal and didn't tell me what it was. So go ahead and be angry, you baby calf-killing bitch!	['bitch']
Sharon	2	0	Very persuasive.	[]
Sheila	7	0	AAAAA! Open this door!! Open this door!!	[]
Chris	13	2	Whoa-ho-ho, let, let me try.  Butters?  Butters, this is your father.	['ho', 'ho']
Butters	8	0	Oh, sweet Jesus. Uh, what do I do?	[]
Stan	10	0	Be strong, Butters. You knew it would come to this.	[]
Chris	3	0	Butters? Answer me!	[]
Butters	8	0	But they-ah they're angry at me.	[]
Kyle	14	0	Don't panic. I'll tell you what to say.  You can tell them...	[]
Chris	3	0	Butters! Right now!	[]
Butters	10	1	Dad, uh, why don't you suck my fat one?	['fat']
Chris	1	0	WHAT?!	[]
Butters	3	0	Oh, sweet Jesus.	[]
Chris	5	0	What's gotten into them?	[]
Sharon	13	0	Alright, Stanley, this has gone on long enough! Your little game is over!	[]
Stan	18	0	This isn't a game, Mom. We're not coming out until know the calves will be safe.	[]
Sharon	31	0	Well that's fine! You boys can just stay in there and starve to death. Us parents are going to go to Pizza Shack and have pepperoni pizza and ice cream.	[]
Cartman	5	1	Oh, God-damnit you guys.	['damnit']
Kyle	6	0	Cartman, stay away from that door!	[]
Sharon	21	0	You'll have to come out sooner or later, boys. The longer you wait, the more trouble you'll be in.	[]
Sheila	1	0	Mmmrragh!!	[]
Stan	7	0	Round one is over. We made it.	[]
Cartman	20	1	We didn't make it! Your mother's right, douchebag! What are we gonna do? Stand here until we starve?!	['douchebag']
Stan	26	0	Our parents would never let us starve. They're bluffing. This is a battle of wills. If we hold out long enough, they'll give in.	[]
Kyle	7	0	But we will have to sleep, dude.	[]
Stan	16	0	Three of us can sleep while one keeps watch. We'll shift every couple of hours.	[]
Butters	11	0	Hehey! This is gonna be just like Vietnam, huh fellas! Whoopie!	[]
Stan	16	0	We'll stay in this room with these baby cows for as long as it takes!	[]
Randy	16	0	Well we tried everything. We can't get through the door without tearing apart the house.	[]
Gerald	8	0	Dear God, it's been over thirteen hours!	[]
Liane	19	0	Oh, but my poor little poopsie must be getting so hungry. Maybe we should get them a little food.	[]
Sharon	23	0	Ms. Cartman, this is a battle of wills. We need our boys to know that we're not gonna cave in, at all.	[]
Liane	3	0	Oh, all right.	[]
Sheila	20	0	Let's all just go to bed and let them play their little game for as long as they can.	[]
Butters	3	0	Good night, fellas!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Good night.	[]
Butters	24	0	Good night, Patches. Good night, Halloway. Good night, Nepture. Good night, Davis. Good night, Bud. Good night, Red. Good night, Paulette. Good night, Chastity.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Butters, I'm going to kill you over and over again.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Can't go on. Need... food...	[]
Kyle	10	0	We didn't realize hunger made you feel so bad.	[]
Cartman	15	0	There's only one alternative, you guys. We're gonna have to eat a calf.	[]
Stan	8	0	No, Cartman, we're not eating a calf!	[]
Cartman	10	0	All right. Then we're gonna have to eat Butters.	[]
Kyle	5	0	He might be right, dude.	[]
Butters	2	0	Aw, heck.	[]
Stan	5	0	Wait, what is that?  Dude!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Food!	[]
Sharon	6	0	Ms. Cartman, what are you doing?	[]
Liane	11	0	Oh, I just can't stand to see my baby suffer	[]
Sharon	7	0	Oh dear God, you've ruined everything.	[]
Kyle	2	0	All right!	[]
Stan	8	0	See? Now we can hold out for weeks!	[]
Cartman	5	0	Look you guys! Beef jerky!	[]
Kyle	4	0	Yeah! And fried chicken!	[]
Stan	1	0	Wha?	[]
"Kyle, Cartman"	1	0	Mmmmm.	[]
Stan	6	0	Dude, what are you guys doing?	[]
Kyle	4	0	We're eating, dude.	[]
Stan	17	1	You're eating meat! What the hell do you guys think we're doing all this for?!	['hell']
Kyle	18	0	Hey! I'm doing it to save little baby cows. I'm not gonna stop eating meat altogether.	[]
Butters	2	0	Me neither.	[]
Cartman	13	1	Yeah, if you don't eat meat at all, you become a pussy.	['pussy']
Stan	17	0	That's fine! You guys can live off of flesh, but I'm never eating meat again!	[]
Cartman	26	0	Go ahead, that's more for us.  You want some beef jerky, buddy? Yes, who's the buddy? Who's hungry?  Who's the hungry man?	[]
Kyle	5	0	Dude, that's messed up.	[]
Kyle	5	0	You guys, check this out!	[]
Field Reporter	26	0	Tom, I'm standing in front of the house where three insane boy terrorists have barricaded themselves inside a room with twenty-three live infant cattle.	[]
Butters	13	0	Hey, look. Some other kids are doin' the same thing we are.  Eugh	[]
Field Reporter	24	0	Several attempts to break into the room have proven unsuccessful, Tom, and the crisis is intensifying. Here's what some people have to say.	[]
"Craig's father, Tom"	23	0	We were sleeping when suddenly we heard all the commotion. I mean, to think this could happen right here in our own community.	[]
Randy	12	0	We gave those kids everything, and they turned into little... John Walkers!	[]
Field Reporter	15	0	The police chief of South Park says that there will be no negotiations with terrorists.	[]
Butters	10	0	Oh no. Eh this is big-time trouble now, fellas.	[]
Stan	7	0	No, this is exactly what we wanted.	[]
Kyle	2	0	It is?	[]
Stan	25	0	Yeah, don't you see? This validates everything that we're doing. If we're making the news, then this is obviously important to people.	[]
Field Reporter	63	0	Tom, it looks like I have an update: Yes, it looks like the boy terrorist story is not interesting news to anyone. Uh, nothing else was going on, Tom, so this was the only story we had to make seem important, but people are just simply tuning out. So, HBC will now be switching programming once again to Puppoies from Around the World.	[]
Stan	5	0	...I don't believe it.	[]
Butters	9	0	Ehuh, the Chinese puppy's... my favorite so far.	[]
Stan	9	0	Butters? Buh-Butters! You have your arm around me!	[]
Butters	8	0	Oh, sorry. I thought you were Mr. Pickles.	[]
Voices	10	0	We must help the helpless, we must save the unsaved	[]
Kyle	6	1	Huh, what the hell is that?	['hell']
Hippies	16	0	If we... fight together we can make sure the road is paved.For a... brighter tomorrow...	[]
Cartman	1	0	Hippies!	[]
Stan	5	0	What are they doing here?	[]
Hippie	14	0	We're with you boys! Your message is real and your voice is just.	[]
Hippies	2	0	Hooray! Hooray!	[]
Kyle	7	1	Dude! Those gaywads are on our side?	['gaywads']
Butters	5	0	Ew, they're all dirty.	[]
Cartman	24	1	What did I tell you, Stan! We save some baby cows from being eaten, and now we're no-good dirty God-damned hippies!	['damned']
Field Reporter	20	0	Tom, the calf terrorist standoff continues as now members of the FBI arrive to put an end to the conflict.	[]
Sharon	3	0	Oh Jesus Christ.	[]
FBI Agent	5	0	Who's in charge here?	[]
Officer Barbrady	9	0	I am. But I don't want to be.	[]
FBI Agent	4	0	Where's the negotiator?	[]
FBI Negotiator	6	0	Right here! Glen Dumont, Negotiator Squad	[]
FBI Agent	7	0	All right, see what you can do.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Dude, are you okay?	[]
Stan	20	0	Aw, I just feel so rundown. I don't know what's wrong with me. I've got these sores.	[]
Butters	3	0	What is that?	[]
Kyle	6	0	Dude, maybe we should end this.	[]
Stan	1	0	No!	[]
Glen Dumont	11	0	Give me a hard line to the phone in that house!	[]
Officer Barbardy	12	0	The terrorists already said there's no way they're coming out.	[]
Glen Dumont	26	0	Don't worry, I'm a negotiator. It's my job to talk to freaks like this and bring about a peaceful resolution using clever psychology.	[]
Stan	1	0	Hello?	[]
Glen Dumont	17	0	Hello, my name is Mike. I'm a negotiator. Is it okay if I talk to you?	[]
Stan	13	0	Ah, hold on.  It's some negotiator named Mike. What do I do?	[]
Kyle	5	0	Don't give him anything!	[]
Stan	4	0	What do I say??	[]
Cartman	8	0	Dah, give me that!  Talk to me Mike.	[]
Glen Dumont	16	0	I'm here to make sure we can all end this peacefully. You want that, right?	[]
Cartman	2	0	Sure, sure.	[]
Glen Dumont	14	0	How about we make a trade, just show that we can trust each other.	[]
Cartman	6	0	What do you have in mind?	[]
Glen Dumont	10	0	Well, how about you send out one of the calves?	[]
Cartman	9	1	Oh, Mike, you're breakin' my balls here, Mike.	['balls']
Glen Dumont	7	0	Just one, that's all we want.	[]
Cartman	23	0	All right, how 'bout this? You guys have all the leverage and we have nothing. So how about we give you one calf... -	[]
Stan	2	0	Cartman, no!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Dude!	[]
Cartman	17	0	We'll give you one calf, if you give us... some guns and ammunition of our own.	[]
Glen Dumont	7	0	What? I, I can't do that.	[]
Cartman	20	0	Oh, I'm sorry. I thought we were talkin' here, but I guess you're not talkin' to me. Goodbye.	[]
Glen Dumont	44	0	No no wait, oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Yuh, you're right. What reason do you have to trust me? I'm just a guy from Lakewood trying to make ends meet, you know? Just a blue-collar guy like your dad.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Don't have a dad, Mike. That's not gonna work.	[]
Glen Dumont	15	0	Oh. All right, fine, son of a gun, let me see what I can do.	[]
Glen Dumont	9	0	Okay. Up a little... left a little...  Almost there.	[]
Randy	3	0	What is that?	[]
Glen Dumont	12	0	We're giving the boys some guns in return for our calves	[]
Randy	1	0	What?	[]
Sharon	6	0	You're giving my baby guns?	[]
Glen Dumont	25	0	Hey, this is a negotiation process, okay? Did you people go to negotiator school? No, you didn't!  Get them on the line for me!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Hello.	[]
Glen Dumont	11	0	Alright, you see that? I keep my end of the bargain.	[]
Cartman	12	0	All right, we'll keep ours. We'll send out one calf.	[]
Glen Dumont	9	0	Well, ha- how about you send out two calves?	[]
Cartman	14	0	Oh, Jesus! You know, there's just no talking to you, is there, Mike?!	[]
Stan	2	0	O-ogh...	[]
Cartman	19	0	We had a deal! Do you think I'm stupid?! Don't treat me like I'm stupid here!	[]
Glen Dumont	20	1	I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  Damnit, I'm losing them.  Okay, I'm sorry. Just send out one calf.	['damnit']
Cartman	12	0	Oh nonono, now you're gonna have to get us something else!	[]
Glen Dumont	6	0	What do you have in mind?	[]
Glen Dumont	14	0	A little to the left...  Okay, that's good. A little to the right.	[]
Sheila	6	0	You're giving them a missile??	[]
Glen Dumont	17	0	Stand down, ma'am! Stand down! This is a delicate process! I've almost earned their trust!	[]
Kyle	6	0	Stan's getting worse, you guys.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Mike, speak.	[]
Glen Dumont	4	0	How are we doin'?	[]
Cartman	16	0	We got a real sick kid here, Mike. Did you get the other things for us?	[]
Glen Dumont	19	0	Weh ah I did manage to get the FDA to officially change the word veal to tortured baby cow.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Good, good.	[]
Glen Dumont	10	0	But I couldn't get you North and South Dakota.	[]
Cartman	6	1	Oh, Mike, breakin' my balls, Mike.	['balls']
Glen Dumont	11	0	Now, now please can, can we get you to come out?	[]
Glen Dumont	20	0	All right, everythng has worked out. The boys have promised to come out and bring the cows out with them.	[]
Adults	4	0	Yes! All right! Woohoo!	[]
Officer Barbrady	8	0	Whoops, sorry I doubted your abilities, Mr. Negotiator.	[]
FBI Agent	5	0	They're coming out now?	[]
Glen Dumont	41	0	Yes. All we need to do in return is get a cattle-transporting semi-truck that will take the boys and the cattle to Denver International Airport, where we have a fully-gassed airplane waiting to take them all to Mexico.	[]
Sharon	1	0	What??	[]
Glen Dumont	19	0	And they want the guy that plays Mr. Worf on Star Trek to drive the truck.  In full makeup.	[]
Randy	2	0	Jesus Christ!	[]
FBI Agent	18	0	All right, that does it! You are in fact the worst negotiator I've ever seen in action!	[]
Glen Dumont	16	0	All right, all right, I'll give you that. But in return, I want three staples.	[]
FBI Agent	32	0	Get out of here!  We'll get them the semi, and we'll get them the Worf guy. If they see that, thay'll come out and then, we could take them.	[]
Officer Barbrady	5	0	But isn't that dishonest?	[]
FBI Agent	33	0	Maybe so, but if we don't do something soon, there could be fifty, even sixty people who'll have to go without veal for dinner. Are you prepared to let that happen?	[]
FBI Agent	6	0	All right. Where is Mr. Dorn?	[]
Michael Dorn	27	1	I was woken up at three in the mornng, told I had to put on makeup, and come to this town.  What the hell is gong on?!	['hell']
FBI Agent	20	0	I'm sorry, Mr. Dorn. It's FBI business. We've got terrorists making demands and we need your help.	[]
Michael Dorn	4	0	This is highly unusual!	[]
FBI Agent	18	0	All right boys, we have your truck. And we have an airplane on the tarmac at Denver International.	[]
Cartman	2	0	And Worf?	[]
Michael Dorn	11	0	My name is Michael Dorn. I play a character called Worf.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Stan! It worked!	[]
Stan	2	0	It... did?	[]
Kyle	17	0	They got us a truck, and an airplane, and Mr. Worf! The calves are gonna be okay!	[]
Stan	8	0	Pick me up. I... I want to see.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Step back! Tell those men to step back!	[]
FBI Agent	2	0	Do it!	[]
FBI Agents	1	0	Mmrrrr.	[]
Hippies	4	0	All right! Woohoo! Yeah!	[]
Cartman	26	0	Aw, shut up, you freakin' hippies!  Alright, Mr. Worf, start the engine and put her in gear. Oh, amd you must refer to me as Captain.	[]
Michael Dorn	7	0	Where am I supposed to drive to?	[]
Cartman	12	0	No. See, must say, Captain, where am I supposed to drive to?	[]
Michael Dorn	8	0	Captain, where am I supposed to drive to?	[]
Cartman	22	0	You're going to back the truck up to the door of the house so we can safely load in the calves.	[]
Michael Dorn	5	0	This whole thing is ridiculous!	[]
Cartman	6	0	Captain, this whole thing is ridiculous!	[]
Michael Dorn	6	0	Captain, this whole thing is ridiculous.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Okay, all set!	[]
Field Reporter	26	0	Tom, it looks as though the terrorists are now loading the baby cows into the back of a semi. This is still very uninteresting news, Tom.	[]
Butters	2	0	Okay Cartman!	[]
Cartman	5	0	Step on it, Mr. Worf!	[]
Boys	2	0	All right!	[]
Butters	3	0	We're going!	[]
Kyle	4	0	Mexico here we come!	[]
Cartman	11	0	Wait a minute. They're following us! Full speed, Mr. Worf!	[]
Michael Dorn	9	0	We cannot keep going fast on these icy roads!	[]
Cartman	10	0	Captain, we cannot keep going fast on these icy roads?	[]
Michael Dorn	10	0	Captain, we cannot keep going fast on these icy roads.	[]
Cartman	16	0	Alright, Mr. Worf. Then reduce speed to forty-five and maintain distance from those police cruisers.	[]
Kyle	11	0	Stan, we're almost there. You've got to hold on.	[]
FBI Agent	11	0	Alright, they're in front of the cattle ranch. Hit it!	[]
Cartman	6	0	Oh, it's a double-cross!!	[]
FBI Agent	15	0	Alright, boys! The game is over! Get out of the truck with your hands up!	[]
Kyle	3	0	Oh no! No!!	[]
Cartman	9	0	What are you waiting for? Go kill them, Worf!	[]
Michael Dorn	5	0	I'm NOT killing anybody!	[]
Cartman	7	1	Egh! Some God-damned Klingon you are!	['damned']
Stan	8	0	We're sorry, cows. We tried. We tried!	[]
FBI Agent	10	0	Alright boys, just stay right there until your parents arrive.	[]
Michael Dorn	4	0	Can I go now?	[]
Officer Barbrady	12	0	Here you go, Mr. Rancher. I got your cattle back for you	[]
Rancher Bob	7	0	Oh.  Well, it doesn't matter now.	[]
Officer Barbrady	4	0	What you do mean?	[]
Rancher Bob	40	0	You see, in the six days since the word veal was officially changed to little tortured baby cow the market has gone dry. Seems that people see little tortured baby cow on their menus, they don't feel like orderin'.	[]
Butters	1	0	Really?	[]
Rancher Bob	23	1	Yep, damn things ain't worth spit now. I'll let 'em live outside with the other cows and live a normal life.	['damn']
Kyle	16	0	Do you hear that, Stan? It worked! We've shut down the veal industry!  Stan? Stan??	[]
Dr. Doctor	20	0	He's very lucky you got him here when you did. He was in a very advanced state of vaginitis.	[]
Randy	1	0	Vaginitis?	[]
Dr. Doctor	36	2	It occurs when a person stops eating meat. Those sores on his skin were actually small vaginas. If we hadn't stopped it in time, Stan would have eventually just become one great big giant pussy.	['vaginas', 'pussy']
Kyle	2	0	Whoa, dude.	[]
Dr. Doctor	19	0	We've got an IV of pure beef blood pumping into Stan's veins and the... sores are fading.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Thank God we stopped it in time.	[]
Stan	34	1	Well, I guess we learned somethng today: it's wrong to eat veal because the animals are so horribly mistreated, but if you don't eat meat at all you break out in vaginas.	['vaginas']
Butters	2	0	Hear hear.	[]
Sheila	18	0	All right boys, it's time to go home. You've got some serious grounding time to start.	[]
Chris	3	0	I'll say!	[]
Butters	5	0	Aw, we're still grounded?	[]
Kyle	11	0	But, but we, we learned things, and took up a cause.	[]
Gerald	19	0	Yes Kyle, but you still defied your parents. And you need to learn that terrorism is never the answer.	[]
Chris	19	0	That's right, let's get these terrorists to their rooms.  But first,  maybe we can grab some burgers.	[]
The Boys	2	0	All right!	[]
