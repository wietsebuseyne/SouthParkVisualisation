PewDiePie	14	0	Uh, like I said, um... Look at this. Look at this. Ooohhh, gigrrig!_	[]

Butters	5	0	What's a PewDiePie do?	[]
Kyle	35	0	Google him. He's this guy from Sweden who has over 30 million YouTube subscribers. We didn't even know, but he's a bigger celebrity to kids than anyone. It just seems so lame.	[]
Cartman	14	0	He plays video games and makes millions of dollars, and it's lame how?	[]
Kyle	35	2	Because- because that's not even entertainment! I mean, it's just, just, rehashing shit, isn't it?? It's like everything these kids are into these days, you know, it's just... rehashed shit!	['shit', 'shit']

Record Executive	17	0	I don't think you're really in a position to turn down this kind of gig.	[]
Randy	6	0	What is that supposed to mean?	[]
Record Executive	10	0	I understand your son gave all your savings to Canada.	[]
Randy	3	0	Yes, Freemium gaming.	[]
Record Executive	35	0	I'm sorry. Freemium gaming destroys lives. I lost my father to Candy Crush.__You need this, Lorde. And the girls out there need you. You've got till tomorrow to think it over._	[]

Kyle	26	0	All I wanted was to play one level of_Call of Duty_and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.	[]
Stan	18	0	I don't get it. The whole fun of_Call of Duty_is that you get to do the shooting.	[]

Kenny	1	0	(Commentary?)	[]
Kyle	51	0	Yeah. You used to sit in the living room with family and friends to hear their commentary on things. Now you can get it with a little guy in a window on the screen. Someone who just comments on stuff. I mean, really? Who would even WANT to do that?!_	[]

Record Executive	6	0	You're nervous, it's understandable.	[]
Randy	17	0	No I'm eh... I know for a fact that I don't sound the same live.	[]
Record Executive	29	0	You think those people out there care what you sound like? You're just another female pop star. Just go out there, pump your hips and rub your clit.	[]
Randy	16	0	Hey! That's not what my music is about! I'm not reducing myself to that!	[]
Iggy	13	1	Oh fuck you, Lorde! You think you're so much better than everyone!	['fuck']
Randy	22	0	No, I don't, Iggy. I just think that our younger girl fans need something a little more positive as role models.	[]
Iggy	32	0	That's easy for you to say because YOU don't have a nice body! Is that why you're so high and mighty, Lorde?! Because you're jealous of this booty?!	[]
Randy	13	0	Iggs, I really don't care to go through this again with you.	[]

Wendy	5	0	Hi everybody. I love you!	[]
Audience	8	0	Thanks for loving me. I love you too.	[]
Wendy	65	0	So I guess there's this new trend with young people where the celebrities they look up to most are YouTube commentators. Just ordinary people who sit in front of a mic and blab their opinions about everything while their mindless loyal followers cheer them on.

Randy	4	0	I was told to!	[]
Sharon	26	0	You were told to walk out in front of a hundred thousand people including little girls who look up to you, and start rubbing your clit.	[]
Randy	49	0	Okay, hold on! A, I don't have a clit, so technically, I wasn't rubbing anything! And B, I didn't want to even perform tonight, but Stanley gave all our money to Canada through a freemium game, so if anyone rubbed their clit, it was him!_	[]
Kyle	8	0	It's dying. The living room is... dying.	[]
Randy	16	0	Yeah, it's me. I need to fix this. How can I undo the clit-rubbing?	[]
Record Executive	32	0	What are you talking about? It's great! You're the most commented-on artist in the world right now! You're blowing up twitter and you're trending on CartmanBrah. #clitnubbin	[]
Randy	13	0	Look, this isn't what I want! My music is supposed to be-	[]
Record Executive	20	0	It's not about the music, Lorde! It never was. It's about comments! And sister, you've got 'em!	[]
Randy	10	0	This ends now. I'm gonna tell people the truth.	[]
Passenger	37	0	Will you look at that? Everyone on their cell phones, nobody sayin' a word to each other. Call me a grandpa, but I still like commenting face to face with folks. You know what I mean, buddy?	[]

Passenger	13	0	You know, excuse me for saying so, but you seem kind of... transparent.	[]
MJ Hologram	7	0	...That's ignorant. I'm just cold.	[]
Passenger	14	0	I'm saying it must make it easier to sneak up on your prey.	[]
MJ Hologram	14	0	Allegedly! I'm weary of this conversation! Can we please stop talking, please?! Ignorant!	[]

Tech 4	7	0	Yes. That might be our only option.	[]
Record Executive	4	0	What is Project Alpha?	[]
Tech 4	23	0	The first hologram we ever created to appear on stage. It was a prototype. But perhaps the best thing to stop a hologram-	[]

Randy	18	0	I'm not interested in being talked out of ending this. It's the right thing to do.	[]
Record Executive	60	0	Do you know what an artist is now, Lorde? An artist is a conversation piece, nothing more.__Like a vase, or a kitschy side table. Just something for people to comment on.__The old ways are dying. We're not making money off records, we're making money off tweets. And you've taken it to a whole new level.	[]
Randy	14	0	Well that's not a world Lorde ever wanted to be a part of.	[]
Record Executive	22	2	On the contrary. Lorde is going on the Jimmy Fallon show tonight and exposing her asshole for everyone to freak out about.	['asshole', 'freak']
Randy	6	0	I'll do no such thing!	[]
Record Executive	6	0	Who said anything about you?_	[]
Randy	13	0	You can't just replace artists with holograms. Who will make the content?	[]
