Mr. Mackey	24	0	M'kay, students, we have a very special guest speaker today. Who can tell me the name of our country's last vice-president?	[]
Kyle	2	1	Dick Cheney?	['dick']
Mr. Mackey	4	0	No, the last one.	[]
Butters	2	0	Bill Clinton.	[]
Mr. Mackey	23	0	No, Clinton's vice-president.  He is here today to talk to you students about some very serious issues. Please welcome Al Gore.	[]
Stan	1	0	Who?	[]
Al Gore	55	0	Thank you, Mr. Mackey, students of South Park Elementary.. I'm here to educate you about the single biggest threat to our planet. You see, there is something out there which threatens our very existence and may be the end of the human race as we know it. I'm talking of course about...  ManBearPig.	[]
Kyle	1	0	ManBearPig?	[]
Al Gore	101	0	It is a creature which roams the earth alone. It is half man, half bear, and half pig. Some people say that ManBearPig isn't real. Well, I'm here to tell you know, ManBearPig is very real, and he most certainly exists. I'm serial. ManBearPig doesn't care who you are or what you've done. ManBearPig simply wants to get you! I'm super-serial.  But have no fear, because I am here to save you! And someday, when the world is rid of ManBearPig, everyone will say Thank you, Al Gore. You're super awesome. The end.	[]
Mr. Mackey	6	0	Uhhh, ohhhkay, thank you Mr. Gore.	[]
Al Gore	4	0	Thank you, class. Excelsior!	[]
Cartman	12	0	Check out this sweet move.  Kyle, you can't block like that.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Just play the game, fatass!	[]
Stan	5	0	Pass it to me, Cartman?	[]
Cartman	14	1	Hang on. I'm going to do something killer.  God damnit, stop it, Kyle!	['damnit']
Cartman	16	0	All right, check it out. This is a total Kobe Bryant I'm about to do.	[]
Kyle	13	1	Just take a shot or pass the ball, asshole! It's getting late!	['asshole']
Cartman	15	1	Let's just see who gets the ball this time, Jewboy!  Kyle, knock it off!	['jewboy']
Stan	6	1	Cartman, stop hogging the goddamned ball!	['goddamned']
Beast	14	0	FOOD!  Don't worry, it's not really ManBearPig. It's me, Al Gore.	[]
Kyle	2	0	We know.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Dude, what are you doing?	[]
Al Gore	60	0	I'm spreading ManBearPig awareness. Here, each of you kids take a pamphlet and a bumper sticker.   I hope now you boys see that this is totally serial. The next time, it could be the real ManBearPig. Can I just get you to sign the awareness sheet? Just your name and phone number and where you first heard about ManBearPig?	[]
Randy	2	0	Uhh, Stan?	[]
Stan	3	0	Oh, hey Dad.	[]
Al Gore	1	0	Hello.	[]
Randy	21	0	It's ah, getting late, boys. Why don't you get in the car and I'll drive you all home?	[]
Kyle	3	0	Okay, Mr. Marsh.	[]
Al Gore	2	0	Be safe.	[]
Randy	15	0	Boys, I don't want you hanging out with that ex vice-president anymore, okay?	[]
Stan	15	0	Aw, he's all right, Dad. He was just trying to warn us about ManBearPig.	[]
Randy	1	0	ManBearPig?	[]
Kyle	7	0	He's half man and half bearpig	[]
Cartman	12	0	No, dude, he's half man and half bear and half pig.	[]
Kyle	6	0	That doesn't make any sense.	[]
Stan	7	0	He could be half bear, half manpig.	[]
Randy	17	0	Boys, there's no such thing as a ManBearPig. The vice president is just desperate for attention.	[]
Stan	17	0	But I feel kind of bad for him, Dad. I don't think he has any friends.	[]
Stan	1	0	Hello?	[]
Al Gore	5	0	Hello, this is Al Gore.	[]
Stan	5	0	Oh man... Hi Mr. Gore.	[]
Al Gore	5	0	I was the vice president.	[]
Stan	2	0	I know.	[]
Al Gore	24	0	Can you and your friends make it to an emergency ManBearPig meeting tomorrow morning? I have some evidence he could be in this area.	[]
Stan	12	0	Eh look, I'm sorry but, we're all kind of busy.	[]
Al Gore	10	0	Oh. I get it. You don't believe me either.	[]
Stan	6	0	No, no, it's not that.	[]
Al Gore	31	0	Yes it is. Nobody believes me!  I'm trying to warn everybody and nobody takes me serial!  I just want somebody in the world to take me serial just for once.	[]
Stan	10	0	Ih it's okay, Mr. Gore, I, I believe you.	[]
Al Gore	4	0	No you don't.	[]
Stan	25	0	Yeah, I'm sure ManBearPig needs to be stopped. I'm just... I'm just scared that I can't do anything to stop him.	[]
Al Gore	3	0	Are you serial?	[]
Stan	4	0	...Yes, I'm serial.	[]
Al Gore	21	0	Don't worry! We CAN stop him! Bring everyone you can to my ManBearPig meeting tomorrow at 8 a.m. sharp!	[]
Cartman	11	0	Dude, why are we going to hang out with this guy?	[]
Kenny	6	0	(Yeah, I don't get it.)	[]
Stan	26	0	Come on, you guys, Al Gore doesn't have any friends. We'll just make an appearance at his little meeting and then we'll go.	[]
Al Gore	23	0	Hi kids! Come on in!  Okay, let's get this meeting started. What do you kids think we should do to stop ManBearPig?	[]
Stan	21	0	Yyeah, you know, Mr. Gore, uh, my dad's a geologist, and he said that ManBearPig probably isn't in Colorado.	[]
Al Gore	16	0	What does your dad look like?? Does he have large hooves where his feet should be??	[]
Stan	1	0	NO.	[]
Al Gore	10	1	Damn. For a minute there, I thought we found him.	['damn']
Stan	18	0	Well, this was a great meeting. Wasn't it, guys? But, we gotta get goin' to school now.	[]
Al Gore	22	0	Oh my God!  ManBearPig screen active! What is this area of Colorado! It's a it's a cave of some kind!	[]
Kyle	12	0	Yeah, that's Cave of the Winds. It's a tourist attraction.	[]
Al Gore	13	0	Oh Jesus on ice skates, we've gotta get down there right away.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Ah I don't think so, dude.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Yeah, we've got school anyway.	[]
Al Gore	8	0	I can get you all excused from school.	[]
Cartman	6	0	You... have that kind of power?	[]
Al Gore	21	0	Look! You boys have a chance to help me find and kill ManBearPig once and for all! I'm totally serial!	[]
Tour Guide	91	0	Hello everyone, welcome to Cave of the Winds. Our tour is gonna take us to two chambers in one of the most elaborate cavern systems in Colorado.  Before we get started I do understand we have a special guest in our group today: the ex vice president, Mr. Al Gore.  Mr. Gore asked me to make sure you all knew he was here. Now, once we enter the cave we do ask you that you follow two rules: stay on the path and do not touch anything. Aright, are we ready?	[]
Group	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Tour Guide	4	0	Let's go cavin'.	[]
Tour Guide	27	0	Here we are in the main chamber of the cave; it was discovered in 1892 and first used as a hideout for smugglers of the Old West.	[]
Al Gore	17	0	Have you noticed high deposits of sulfur or a salmon-like odor coming from the caves lately?	[]
Tour Guide	21	0	Ahh, no.  Now, as you can see, the cave is filled with stalagmites and stalactites. Water drips from the cave's...	[]
Al Gore	14	0	All right, kids, I need you to keep an eye out for ManBearPig droppings.	[]
Kyle	6	0	What do ManBearPig droppings look like?	[]
Al Gore	7	0	Similar to pig droppings, but more manbearlike.	[]
Tour Guide	57	1	These rocks often make interesting shapes which we like to name. For instance, this one here we named The Hanging Mushroom.  And over here we have Man With Helmet and Two Bowling Balls.  And finally, of course, the Two Sisters.  Now the cave itself is millions of years old and has a constant temperature of 57 degrees.	['balls']
Al Gore	2	0	Groan! Groan!	[]
Tour Guide	7	0	Sir? Mr. Gore? Is there a problem?	[]
Al Gore	2	0	Not yet.	[]
Tour Guide	18	0	All right, everyone, if you'll step this way, you'll see how the cave gets its name.	[]
Al Gore	5	0	Kids! Kids, over here! Look.	[]
Kyle	1	0	What?	[]
Al Gore	25	0	I bet this is where he's hiding.  This looks like ManBearPig Central. Come on!  Come on! This is where ManBearPig is! I'm serial!	[]
Tour Guide	17	0	In certain areas of the cave, the wind actually blows through, causing a sound you can hear.	[]
Group	1	0	Wow...	[]
Woman	7	0	Take a picture of the sound, Steven.	[]
Stan	12	0	Mr. Gore, I I think we should stay with the tour group.	[]
Al Gore	25	1	Wait! Shhh.  Christ! He's here! Take this rope!  Be ready to tie him up!  I've got you now, you son of a bitch!	['bitch']
Kyle	4	0	What are you doing?!	[]
Stan	2	0	Oh no!	[]
Al Gore	1	0	No!	[]
The Boys	1	0	Aaaah!	[]
Al Gore	6	1	Leave them alone, you Goddamned ManBearPig!	['goddamned']
The Boys	1	0	Help!	[]
Al Gore	7	1	Damn you ManBearPig! They're just children!	['damn']
Tour Guide	13	0	O-kay, everyone, out of the cave. Now!  Go! Go! Go out, now!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Hello?	[]
Stan	1	0	Help!	[]
Kyle	5	0	We're trapped in here!	[]
Cartman	7	0	Somebody get us some help down hyah!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Hello, help!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Hello??	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Hello!)	[]
Stan	1	0	Help!	[]
Kyle	7	0	Forget it! They can't hear us!	[]
Kenny	5	0	(What are we gonna do??)	[]
Cartman	9	1	You'd better get us out of here, asshole!	['asshole']
Stan	1	0	Me??	[]
Cartman	18	0	You just had to go and be nice to Al Gore! Now we're trapped in a cave!	[]
Stan	8	0	Maybe there's another way out of here.	[]
Kenny	3	0	(Oh, no kidding.)	[]
Kyle	26	0	A-all right, let's split up and look for a passageway. E-everyone take a different direction.  Oh man, we're in big trouble here.	[]
Cartman	15	2	This is... bullcrap! If I'm thin- I'm gonna be so... pissed off!  Goddammit!	['bullcrap', 'goddammit']
Kyle	4	0	You see anything, Kenny??	[]
Kenny	2	0	(No, nothing!)	[]
Kyle	5	0	Cartman?? Cartman, you see anything??	[]
Cartman	10	0	No, nothing  No, nothing here! Nothing this way!  Tr... treasure.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Cartman, you okay??  You need help??	[]
Cartman	15	0	I'm fine! This way is just a... dead end! Coming back to you now!	[]
Kyle	8	0	It looks like we're completely sealed in.	[]
Kenny	3	1	(Yeah, No shit.)	['shit']
Stan	23	0	There's a small passageway about 200 yards over there, but... it goes for a long long way and it's pretty steep.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Maybe we should go for it.	[]
Cartman	13	0	You guys go on ahead. I'm gonna... stay here, wait it out.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Why?	[]
Cartman	20	0	I just... I I don't feel very good. I'll just wa-, I'll just weigh you guys down.	[]
Stan	15	0	Cartman's right. First rule of survival is stay put and wait to be rescued.	[]
Cartman	9	0	No, it's okay. You guys go on ahead.	[]
Kyle	28	0	No, we'll stay here too. If we start wandering off, we're gonna get lost or killed. Let's just wait here and hope help comes soon.	[]
Cartman	23	0	That's cool. I just... I just wouldn't go over there  if I were you guys. I just took a huge dump.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Aw, dude!	[]
Miner 1	25	0	The cave-in was massive. It has cut off all access in or out. The children are believe to be trapped somewhere in this area.	[]
Miner 2	7	0	Does anybody know who these kids are?	[]
Miner 1	22	0	No, nobody seems to knew them. Only that they were in the tour group. Digging to them is going to take days.	[]
Al Gore	26	0	Excuse me, Excuse me. This cave-in was no accident, and it isn't going to stop unless we move fast! I am super... duper... serial!	[]
Miner 1	9	0	What do you mean? The cave-in is over.	[]
Al Gore	13	0	I'm afraid you have a much bigger problem than a cave-in.	[]
Miner 1	3	0	What's that?	[]
Fireman	5	0	What is that, a pigbearman?	[]
Al Gore	5	0	No, stupid! It's ManBearPig!	[]
Stan	13	0	I'm sooo hungry. Do you think people even know we're here?	[]
Kyle	13	0	They saw us on the tour.  Dude, where do you keep going, Cartman?	[]
Cartman	14	1	I just... n-need to keep taking a crap. I got diarrhea, really bad.	['crap']
Kyle	18	1	Dude, it's bad enough we have to sit here without you taking a crap every ten minutes!	['crap']
Stan	11	0	Let's just try to sleep. Maybe help will come tomorrow.	[]
Cartman	96	1	All that treasure.  It's all mine!  So long as these greedy assholes don't find out about it!  You would all just looove to get your hands on my treasure, wouldn't you?! Even though I found it, you'd love to think it's somehow yours, too! God, I hate you guys!  Especially you, you money-grubbing snake in the grass!  Well I have news for you, Kyle! You're never going to get my treasure. I've got a little plan going, to get the treasure out of here without you ever knowing.	['assholes']
Kyle	2	0	C-Cartman?	[]
Cartman	7	0	Oh. Hey Kyle. How's it goin'?	[]
Kyle	5	0	Dude, what are you doing?	[]
Cartman	13	0	Not much. You know, just hangin' out. How've you been, man? Good?	[]
Kyle	5	0	Dude, get away from me!	[]
Cartman	11	0	Yeah. It's nice talking with you, Kyle. See you around.	[]
Al Gore	26	0	Why won't anybody listen to me?! ManBearPig is in there and we have to kill him while we all have the chance. I'm serial!	[]
Miner 3	18	0	Mr. Gore, please, we need you to calm down. Now, w-what exactly do you suggest we do?	[]
Al Gore	40	0	I told you we need to fill the cave with hot molten lead, 'cause it's the only way to make sure ManBearPig never comes out! And I'm sane and I'm totally serial, but everyone just keeps digging!	[]
Miner 3	21	0	Well, see, the problem is that if we fill the caves with hot molten lead, it will kill those boys too.	[]
Al Gore	34	0	They're already dead! Didn't you listen to me?? They got attacked by a ManBearPig and ManBearPig leaves nobody alive! I'm super serial! Nobody will listen to me but I'm serial!	[]
Police Officer	13	0	Do you want me to get the ex vice president out of here?	[]
Miner 2	18	0	Naw, I f- I feel kind of bad for him. I don't think he has any friends.	[]
Cartman	14	0	All right. Gotta be strong.  There's still a lot more treasure to go.	[]
Stan	5	0	Dude, he's really sick.	[]
HBC Reporter	33	0	It's been three days since four unidentified children were trapped in a cave-in. Three days without food and time is certainly running out. The digging continues, but progress is fatally slow.	[]
Miner 1	27	0	All right, people, we've gotta work faster! Our best estimate still puts us three days from reaching the area of the cave called Smuggler's Den.	[]
Ranger	3	0	Smuggler's Den?	[]
Tour Guide	23	0	Ih it's a room near the end of the tour where you can get your picture taken with fake treasure. Here, see?	[]
Miner 1	26	0	Based on where the boys were seen last, they're somewhere near this area! Hopefully they've followed the first rule of survival and stayed put.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Stan! Stan, wake up!	[]
Stan	7	0	Huh? What? Have they come for us?	[]
Kyle	10	0	No, it's Cartman. Something's really wrong with him.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Meh, meuh urgh.  Mbeuh.	[]
Stan	9	0	Oh my God.  Cartman? Dude, can you hear me?	[]
Cartman	10	0	I'm fahn. Just a lit-  No big deal.  Beh.	[]
Kyle	21	0	We can't wait here any longer! Dude, we've gotta get him out of here or he's gonna die.	[]
Stan	16	0	How, dude? We c- we don't even know if that passage I found goes anywhere.	[]
Kyle	20	0	Maybe we should get out first. See if we can find a way out and then come back for him.	[]
Cartman	17	1	NO DON'T! Don't leave me here, you assholes. Don't leave me here to die.	['assholes']
Kyle	5	0	Come on come on! Pull!	[]
Stan	5	1	Goddamnit, he's soo heavy!	['goddamnit']
Cartman	11	0	Buh. Hurry you guys. You gotta get me out of here.	[]
Kyle	5	1	What the hell is that??	['hell']
Stan	1	0	Cartman?	[]
Cartman	12	0	You guys, we've got no time! You gotta get me out!!	[]
Al Gore	8	0	This is the end of you, ManBearPig.  Excelsior!	[]
Kenny	4	0	(We're almost there!)	[]
Stan	12	0	I can't keep carrying him, dude! I've got no strength!	[]
Cartman	3	0	Yes you do!	[]
Kyle	8	1	What the hell is that?  Oh my God.	['hell']
Cartman	13	0	No! Let me out of here! Let me out of here, you guys!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Ruuun!	[]
Miner 1	13	0	That's it! Pull everyone out! There's nothing more we can do!	[]
Fireman 2	6	0	You're calling off the rescue?	[]
Miner 1	16	1	We didn't plan on a freak river flood. God must really want those kids dead.	['freak']
Fireman 2	8	0	Well what if the children aren't dead?	[]
Miner 1	17	0	Look, the cavern is completely flooded. Nothing could have survived. There's nothing left alive down there.	[]
Al Gore	30	0	Nothing left alive...  I did it. I killed ManBearPig. I've saved the earth from certain destruction. Everyone is super-stoked on me, even if they don't know it.	[]
Stan	11	0	Kenny! Here, take my hand!  Hurry Kyle, the water's rising!	[]
Cartman	3	0	Grab my hand.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Car... Cartman! You've gotta swim! Kick with your legs!	[]
Cartman	4	0	I can't kick!	[]
Kyle	3	0	Yes you can!	[]
Cartman	8	0	I can't! Kick yourself back to safety!	[]
Kyle	4	0	I need your help!	[]
Cartman	7	0	No, you just have to save me.	[]
Stan	2	0	Kyle! No!	[]
Al Gore	35	0	We are gathered here to say goodbye to four kids whom we all tried to help, but, in the end, could not. But where there is loss, there is hope. For ManBearPig is no more.	[]
Tour Guide	6	0	Oh Jesus, here we go again.	[]
Al Gore	52	0	I have beaten ManBearPig, and we will never forget the names of the brave young kids who lost their lives. Kid 1, Kid 2, Kid 3, and of course, Kid 4.  I remember how Kid 1 used to laugh and play.  And how Kid 2 was always there when I needed him.	[]
Stan	1	0	Agh.	[]
Miner 4	3	0	Oh my God!	[]
Miner 1	4	0	It's the kids!	[]
Miner 4	3	0	They're alive!	[]
Al Gore	4	0	Kids! I saved you!	[]
Stan	52	1	Just stay away from us, asshole! I was nice to you because I felt sorry for you, because you don't have any friends! But now I see WHY you don't have any friends! You just used ManBearPig as a way to get attention for yourself because you're a LOSER!!	['asshole']
Al Gore	11	0	Hyeah right. The man who singlehandedly killed ManBearPig is a loser.	[]
Kyle	11	0	We need to get our friend to a hospital right away!	[]
Cartman	14	0	No! No I'm fine!  I just need to get home, a-and rest.	[]
Stan	8	0	Cartman, seriously, you need to see a doctor.	[]
Cartman	15	0	Noo! I just need to get to a toilet. See you guys. I...  habbeh... HABBEHHHHHHHHHH!	[]
Kyle	6	1	Dude, did Cartman just crap treasure?	['crap']
Cartman	25	0	It's mine! It's mine, you hear me?! I got it out of the cave; it belongs to me! Keep your greedy hands away!	[]
Tour Guide 2	14	0	Hey, that looks like the fake treasure from our Smuggler's Den photo room.	[]
Cartman	7	0	That's right, and I...  Fake treasure?	[]
Tour Guide 2	25	0	Yeah, we put it there for kids to take their picture with. All in all, I'd say that treasure is worth about fourteen dollars.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Noo... NOOO!!  NOO! OW!	[]
Kyle	16	1	You made us pull you to safety because you ate treasure?! You son of a bitch!	['bitch']
Cartman	12	0	Don't you think I'm hurting enough, Kyle?! Ah, ow!!  Dowww!	[]
Al Gore	37	0	Well, my work here is done. I've killed MBP, and now I must save the world from something else. Maybe I'll make a movie. A movie starring me. Then people will take me super-serial.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Eh!	[]
