Pharmacist	10	0	Next please.  You are sure you want to do this?	[]
Man	5	0	Of course I'm sure!	[]
Pharmacist	5	0	Okay, roll up your sleeve.	[]
Cartman	23	0	I can't believe we all got duped. I've been wearin' this stupid things for months! I feel like such a tool.	[]
Clyde	2	1	Lying jerk!	['jerk']
Pharmacist	3	0	Hold still please.	[]
Mr. Mackey	10	0	I don't know what to believe in anymore, okay?!	[]
Cartman	31	1	All right, let's do this! Make me believe in something that's bullshit, will you?!  Oh, hold on.  Aah, let's see... that one.  Stupid fraud!  Good riddance to YOU!	['bullshit']
Man 2	14	0	All right, I'm next! I'm next! Get this thing off of me!	[]
Kyle	4	0	Did you do it?	[]
Cartman	14	0	Yep, it's done. You know I spent five bucks on that stupid thing?!	[]
Kenny	8	0	(I told you it was a bad idea.)	[]
Cartman	30	0	Oh don't even start, Kenny! Just because you guys didn't buy into the bracelets doesn't mean you're smarter than me, okay?!  What's wrong with him?	[]
Randy	7	0	Oh I feel like such an idiot.	[]
Stan	5	0	It's all right, Dad.	[]
Randy	22	0	But I wore that wristband everywhere, and the guy's a complete phoney!  There's even more coming out about it today.	[]
Anchor	65	1	These latest tests are once again confirming that the performance-enhancing drug HGH was in the body of Christ at the time of crucifixion. All over the country people are having their What Would Jesus Do wristbands cut off. It was just last week a team of scientists found traces of HGH on the Shroud of Turin  , along with several other illegal compounds and painkillers.	['drug']
Lead Scientist	30	0	Without a doubt there was uh HGH in the body of Christ at the time of crucifixion. Jesus did not suffer for our sins, he was in fact very high.	[]
Randy	12	0	All the years of being told somethin'. It's just so unfair!	[]
Anchor	19	0	Priests and bishops have been working overtime to remove Jesus from the record books and from The Last Supper.	[]
Randy	18	0	I know people that paid ten bucks for those bracelets. I bet they all feel pretty stupid now.	[]
Butters	15	0	Yeah, and so, and so then, I asked Preacher, Well, what about the New Testament?	[]
Cartman	2	0	Uh huh.	[]
Butters	27	0	And he says, Well you still should oughta read it, but you're gonna need to put an asterisk next to Jesus' name whenever it comes up.	[]
Cartman	21	1	So weak dude. Dark times, brah, dark times.  Dude, what the hell? You're wearing a What Would Jesus Do bracelet!	['hell']
Stan	13	0	All right all right, I got it a few weeks ago. Big whoop.	[]
Cartman	19	0	The big whoop isn't that you have one, the big whoop is that you're still wearing it!	[]
Butters	13	1	Yeah, Stan. Didn't you hear Jesus did all his miracles on drugs?	['drugs']
Stan	3	0	Yeah I know.	[]
Cartman	17	0	Well don't you care?! Jesus Asterisk Christ, Stan! People are feeling really cheated by all this!	[]
Mr. Mackey	9	0	Wuughhhuh. Where do I go? What do I do?	[]
Craig	17	0	Cartman's right. If you care about fairness, Stan, then you really have to lose the bracelet.	[]
Stan	17	0	Look I just don't want to, you guys. Honestly, it's not that big a deal.	[]
Announcer	9	0	It's the Charlie Rose show. Here's Chuck.	[]
Charlie Rose	23	0	We are here tonight with the only person in America who still wears his What Would Jesus Do wristband. Please welcome Stan Marsh.	[]
A Voice	1	1	Dick!	['dick']
Charlie Rose	21	0	Stan, after everything that's come out, after all the facts have been proven, why do you still wear the wristband?	[]
Stan	8	0	I don't know,  I just like it.	[]
Charlie Rose	4	0	You just like it.	[]
Stan	19	0	Yeah. I donno. I've had it a long time, I just don't feel like cutting it off.	[]
Charlie Rose	42	1	Well joining us now is just one of the billions of people who think that anyone who still wears their What Would Jesus Do wristband is doing all of society a disservice. Chris Martin you say that Stan Marsh is... a dick?	['dick']
Chris Martin	88	1	Yeah, yeah, thanks Charlie. My problem with this kid is he doesn't care about the truth! Okay, if Jesus rose from the dead with the help of drugs, that's fine, but then he went on to say it was a miracle, and that is where it became dangerous! What about the Incas?! What about the Aztecs?! Millions of people who were murdered in Jesus's name, and then Jesus turns out to be a fraud! Wearing that bracelet is a slap in the face to everyone!	['drugs']
Charlie Rose	7	0	What do you say about that, Stan?	[]
Stan	7	0	...I don't know.  I like it.	[]
Charlie Rose	48	2	All right, well we searched high and low to find my next guest who actually agrees with Stan Marsh, and thinks he's doing the right thing. Please welcome a retarded fish.  Now, Retarded Fish, you don't see any problem at all with someone keeping their bracelet	['retarded', 'retarded']
Chris Martin	38	1	That that's because, that's because you're a retarded fish, and you don't know any better! What about the Crusades?! The Inquisitions?! How many people were tortured to death for somebody who is a fake?!	['retarded']
Charlie Rose	13	0	What about the Crusades, Stan? Soes that enter into your decision at all?	[]
Stan	7	0	No, I just, I don' know. No.	[]
Charlie Rose	5	1	Anything to add, Retarded Fish?	['retarded']
Retarded Fish	7	0	Nnno, No, I'm good. Thank you.	[]
Mr. Mackey	24	0	Stan! Hey Stan, can I talk to you?  Listen, Stan, ah I just wanna tell you... You've really been an inspiration m'kay?	[]
Stan	2	0	I have?	[]
Mr. Mackey	59	1	Yeah. You know, I can't believe in Jesus anymore, 'cause he's a damned fraud, so what I'm gonna believe in is just bein' me, and bein' independent like you. So what I did is I got this brown bracelet to remind me of standing my ground, uhkay? And just believin' in the cause of bein' me.	['damned']
Stan	9	0	You're wearing a bracelet to think of me?	[]
Mr. Mackey	18	0	Oh I'm not the only one. There's lost of people doin' it.  Hey Butters. Stand ground.	[]
Butters	4	0	Stand ground, Mr. Mackey!	[]
Mr. Mackey	15	0	Anyway, thanks Stan. And... you know, just keep on, keep on standing your ground, okay?	[]
Stan	7	0	You're wearing a brown bracelet, Butters?	[]
Butters	36	0	Well yeah.  It helps remind me that I shouldn't back down anymore when I feel pressure from other people. I just got really moved when I saw what did for all those farmers in Belarus.	[]
Stan	3	0	...Farmers in where?	[]
Worker	9	0	Move aside, farmers! This land is no longer yours!	[]
Farmer	18	0	We will not move aside! We will stand our ground!  Like the child on the Charlie Rose show!	[]
Stan	9	0	Dude, where are people getting all the brown wristbands?	[]
Butters	12	0	I donno. I got mine down at 7-11.  See? Right here.	[]
Clerk	14	0	Hello, you interested in the Stanground braceleh-OH! Wow, it's you!  Stanground, brah!	[]
Stan	6	0	Wow, this is happening so fast.	[]
Steve Nelson	14	1	Hello Stan, Steve Nelson with Endorsement Management. Are you ready for your Nike commercial?	['endorsement']
Stan	34	0	My friends told me I was crazy,  that I was wasting my time.  But my cause is to stand my ground.  When others sat, I kept my bracelet on, because I stand...  for standing.	[]
Waiter	6	0	Would you like to be seated?	[]
Stan	5	0	No thanks. I'll stand.	[]
Moviegoer	4	0	Hey, you wanna siddown?	[]
Stan	3	0	I'm good.	[]
Flight Attendant	10	0	Sir, the captain has asked everyone to take their seats.	[]
Stan	28	0	Tell the captain to take off.  People ask me, You never took the bracelet off? Not once?  No. Never. Not. Ever.  What do I do? I Stan ground.	[]
Mr. Garrison	25	0	Now, when Dr. Drew told Jeff Conway he was on a one-way street to nowhere, what tactics did he use to try and convince-?	[]
Lawyer	14	0	Mr. Marsh, if you don't mine, we'd like to see your bracelet.	[]
Stan	2	0	For what?	[]
Lead Scientist	13	0	If you have nothing to hide, then please hand it over, Mr. Marsh.	[]
Kyle	6	0	What are you people talking about?	[]
Field Reporter	62	0	Are we good? We live? Tom, I'm here at South Park Elementary, where officials have barged their way in after reports of Stan Marsh of the Stanground Foundation did in fact at one point remove his yellow bracelet. Rumors have surfaced that Stan did not stan his ground as previously stated, and that the wristband is in fact superglued back together.	[]
Lead Scientist	8	0	Please let us check your wristband for superglue.	[]
Stan	4	0	No! This is stupid!	[]
Butters	19	0	He's the one person who doesn't do stuff like that! Why don't you leave him alone!	[]
Lead Scientist	12	0	Are you afraid we might find glue on your bracelet, Mr. Marsh?	[]
Stan	6	0	No! I never cut if off!	[]
Lead Scientist	6	0	Then, let us ah-see it.	[]
Jimmy	16	0	This is an outrage! Who out there is saying that our friend Stan is a liar?	[]
Lead Scientist	17	0	I cannot say, but he is a reliable and credible source who is of the utmost prestige.	[]
Butters	1	0	Who?	[]
Lead Scientist	5	0	All right, it was Craig.	[]
Cartman	3	1	Craig?! You asshole!	['asshole']
Stan	6	0	What's the big idea, Craig?!	[]
Craig	11	0	It just looked like you cut it off, that's all.	[]
Stan	22	0	You got nothin' better to do than try and knock me down?! You can't just say anything you want about people!	[]
Butters	8	0	Ooo, look at him go, Stanning his ground!	[]
The Class	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Stan	13	0	You know what happens when you lie, Craig?! You hold that lie inside!	[]
Butters	2	0	Go Stan!	[]
Stan	17	1	And it grows and it grows, right in your balls, until they have to cut it out!	['balls']
Butters	6	0	...A little unnecessary, but go Stan!	[]
Stan	18	0	Go ahead and test it! Then let's just see what happens to this money-hungry, alcoholic prostitute!	[]
The Class	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Butters	1	0	Prostitute!	[]
Announcer	4	0	This is breaking news.	[]
Anchor	32	0	The tests are done and the results are in. The little boy who claimed he never cut off his What Would Jesus Do bracelet did cut it off, and lied about it.	[]
Lead Scientist	29	0	Not only did we find traces of ah-superglue, but of yellow magic ah-markeur as well. This is a dark ah-day for honest French-Swedish people everywheure.	[]
Anchor	12	0	Though the tests seem conclusive, Stan Marsh continues to deny any cheating.	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Hey dude, people are kind of pissed off at you.	[]
Stan	2	0	Thanks Kyle.	[]
Kyle	14	0	You probably should come clean and tell the truth. Did you superglue your bracelet?	[]
Stan	4	0	Why does it matter?!	[]
Kyle	7	0	Because you kind of made it matter.	[]
Stan	26	0	You know, I'm just, I'm just through with this whole thing! I just, I can't put my family through any more of this!	[]
Kyle	6	0	S-so you did superglue it.	[]
Stan	41	1	Ugh, you know what's really sad?! That this is what matters to people! What nobody seems to remember are the farmers in Belarus! STANground is bigger than me! You wanna tell all those farmers in Belarus it's all bullcrap?!	['bullcrap']
Kyle	27	0	Dude, the sooner you eat your peas, the sooner you can try to win some of your friends back. Eh ya you need to Bill Clinton this.	[]
Stan	49	0	You really think I went through all that trouble, lying about my wristband and claiming to be something I wasn't, for what, Kyle?! For what?!  This is a witch hunt, dude! It's all that stupid French scientist! He's the fraud, and I'm gonna prove it!	[]
Wife	8	0	Would you mind getting me some water, darling?	[]
Lead Scientist	12	0	Can't you see I'm trying to do ah-my calisthenics?	[]
Wife	13	0	But my throat is parched, dear, and I'm so scared of burglars.	[]
Lead Scientist	28	0	Is ah-tap water going to be okay, or do you want me to go down to Crystal Geyser and bring Her Highness some right from the spring?	[]
Wife	4	0	Tap is fine, dear.	[]
Wife	11	0	What was that? I could have sworn I saw something outside.	[]
Lead Scientist	5	0	It's ah-your imagination	[]
Wife	13	0	Oh darling, could you change the channel for me? The remote is dead.	[]
Lead Scientist	22	0	You just want me to change the channel or should I go and make a TV program written ah-just for you?!	[]
Wife	7	0	No, just change to channel 10, thanks.	[]
Lead Scientist	14	0	It's ah-starting to feel like ah-The Carole Burnett Show in here.	[]
Wife	8	0	What was that?! I think somebody's here!	[]
Lead Scientist	17	0	Maybe it's ah-the peepee fairy so somebody can ah-take a peepee for you too.	[]
Wife	9	0	Please I'm terrified. Please go check it out.	[]
Stan	1	0	Jesus!	[]
Jesus	1	0	Shhhh.	[]
Stan	5	0	What are you doing here?	[]
Jesus	27	0	My child, the man who lives here has led a witch hunt to destroy my legacy. I am simply here to search for something I can use...	[]
Stan and Jesus	4	0	...to discredit him too.	[]
Jesus	6	0	That's what I'm doing.	[]
Lead Scientist	18	0	Oh, it's ah-Tweedle Dumb and ah-Tweedle Dee trying to break in-ah-to my house!	[]
Stan	16	1	Jesus, everyone is claiming you were using drugs to resurrect. Why didn't you say anything?	['drugs']
Jesus	9	0	Sometimes it is best to say nothing, my son.	[]
Stan	8	0	Yeah, I've been kind of seein' that.	[]
Lead Scientist	27	0	Ah-excuse me, I'm sorry to intrude, but do you want to please ah-leave or should I make you some kofel bread and ah-sausages?!	[]
Stan	16	0	It all just happened so fast. The next thing I knew I had a Nike commercial.	[]
Jesus	6	0	Yeah, I know how it goes.	[]
Stan	9	0	Everyone hates me now, and it isn't fair.	[]
Jesus	24	0	I know. I just feel like if people could see me in action again, they'd they'd realize I'm not a fraud.	[]
Lead Scientist	10	0	Here you go, kofel bread and some sausage for you.	[]
Stan	12	0	Thanks a lot.  Jesus, did you take HGH to do your miracles?	[]
Jesus	21	0	NO! Pff! That's just... no! Okay? No. Everyone just lost their faith. Did you cut your wristband off, my son?	[]
Stan	16	0	NO! Pff! No, that's no, okay? No. And anyway, it's not even the issue.	[]
Jesus	4	0	Pff, I know, right?	[]
Stan	8	0	Pff it's like, that's here  and...	[]
Jesus	10	0	Pfyeah and we're, like, you know, p-yeah, here.	[]
Stan	22	0	Pff, there's there's farmers in Belarus who are in a life and death struggle. THAT's what should be important!	[]
Jesus	21	0	P-yeah! Instead of focusing on us, we need to get everyone focusing on what matters! Where's Belaruh-ruh-roos?	[]
Stan	9	0	Exactly! People don't even know where it is.	[]
Jesus	25	0	Maybe, if we could get people to care about it, then I could go and save it, and people would be stoked on me again!	[]
Stan	5	0	How can we raise awareness?	[]
Jesus	6	0	We need to get some bracelets.	[]
P.F. Pityef	15	0	Welcome, welcome, to the P.F. Pityef Bracelet Factory. How can I be of service?	[]
Stan	18	0	Well, we wanted to start a new movement, and we thought since your company makes all the bracelets...	[]
P.F. Pityef	23	0	Ah, I see you're wearing one of our brown scauses already. Delightful. What color would you like your new scause to be?	[]
Stan	2	0	Our... scause?	[]
P.F. Pityef	22	0	Well of course! You came for a scause to wear on your paws. And you want others to wear yours upon thaurs.	[]
Jesus	3	0	I'm confused.	[]
P.F. Pityef	197	2	Hm. Perhaps I should start from the beginning.  In the modern age there are those who believe That a cause is a thing to be worn on one's sleeve.  And so, we sell a cause. It's called a scause. And wearing a scause gets you lots of applause.  We start with some plastic which is shirped by our shirpist Then dip it in colors that show off your purpose. There are green scauses for recycling, blue scauses for kitties,  And pink scauses that focus on nothing but titties.  Do you hate abortion? Ah! Then a white scause is for you!  Why not champion your scause with some sparkles and glue? We make scauses for this! We make scauses for that!  Why there's even a scause for just being fat!  What's the matter? Can't think of a scause?  How about raising awareness for the hairs in your schnozz? Let's just think of the thing that you care about most.  Then let's make it orange, like marmalade toast! And now I'd like to say thank you for your coming down. I'm off to go sell these in your little town!	['titties', 'fat']
Stan	5	1	Dude, the hell just happen?	['hell']
Mr. Mackey	45	0	Kids? Kids, okay, I need to talk to you about a serious matter.  You probably all noticed my orange wristband , mkay? It's to show my solidarity with the people of Belarus.  Mkay, you should know that the Belarusian government is right now trying to-	[]
Craig	11	0	We know, Mr. Mackey. We all have our Belarus bracelets too.	[]
Mr. Mackey	29	0	Oh you do? Ya you got you got those? Okay, okay, that's good! Good you're doin' something about it, m'kay.  Uh hey kids. Kids over here...	[]
Cartman	12	0	Dude, what's this about orange bracelets? Where do you get them?	[]
Clyde	15	0	There's a guy selling them downtown. But they're not made from recycled plastic.	[]
Cartman	11	1	Dude, I don't give a crap about using recycled plastic!	['crap']
Clyde	3	0	Yes you do.	[]
Cartman	9	0	...Oh, I guess I do care about that. Huh.	[]
Butters	33	0	Hey Stan, well, some people are sayin' that you knew what you were doing all along. That, that you, you cut off your wristband on purpose to shed light on the Belarusian farmers.	[]
Stan	4	0	People are saying that?	[]
Butters	4	0	Yeeah. Is it true?	[]
Stan	29	0	Wow! You know, whatever it takes, Butters. People are aware of the problems in Belarus; maybe I did it all on purpose or maybe it was just a coincidence.	[]
Butters	22	2	Heyah, whatever Stan. Yeah I thought you were a butthole,  but n-now I think you're a good sneaky little butthole.	['butthole', 'butthole']
Stan	3	0	We did it.	[]
Anchor	35	0	It has become the biggest concern for most people. The farmers of Belarus and their plight against their government. And now one person is taking it upon himself to end the crisis. His name? Jesus.	[]
Jesus	29	0	These are very troubling times and these farmers are literally fighting for their lives. You know I'm uh, ah-I'm here just to do whatever I can.	[]
Field Reporter	27	1	Jesus, some people might be thinking you're doing this as some kind of a publicity stunt to put to rest the rumors of your drug use?	['drug']
Jesus	55	0	You know, ah I don't even have time to think about that. This is a crisis that needs my attention and I'm just here to do whatever I can. I've talked to the government here and I've talked to the farmers, and I think we have everything just about worked out.	[]
Farmers	1	0	AAAAH!!	[]
Jesus	24	0	You know, whatever stupid rumors people wanna believe about me, it doesn't change the fact that the people of Belarrus need my help.	[]
Field Reporter	7	0	Ah I believe it's Belarus, Jesus.	[]
Jesus	13	0	Yes, it very well may be if we don't do something now.	[]
Field Reporter	17	0	Um, so you think you've something here to keep the conflict from escalating, is that right?	[]
Jesus	34	1	I'm just doing what I've always done. People wanna know what I'm on. What am I on? I'm on a farm in Belarrus busting my ass! What are you on?!	['ass']
Field Reporter	16	0	Uh huh, and now that the Belarusian farmers are all dead, what will you try next?	[]
Jesus	3	1	What?  Aw, shit!	['shit']
P.F. Pityef	9	0	One at a time, please. One at a time.	[]
Mr. Mackey	14	0	Look, I want to return this orange bracelet, m'kay?!  It's worthless now!	[]
P.F. Pityef	19	0	Not a problem, you can return your scause and for just five dollars I'll give you two more!	[]
Cartman	25	0	Okay, I need a violet one for domestic violence, a lime one for herpes, and a jade green one for how much I hate Kyle.	[]
P.F. Pityef	4	0	Absolutely! Five dollars please.	[]
Kyle	11	0	Heidi Turner said you asked her to borrow superglue last week.	[]
Stan	14	0	Are you still on that dude?! Have you ever heard of ends justifying means?!	[]
P.F. Pityef	6	0	Oh my, it's the sound!	[]
Butters	3	0	Wu-what sound?	[]
P.F. Pityef	93	0	Of all sounds in all sounddom this one's most profound.  That's the sound that means I must pack up my tent. It's the sound of the last cent being spent.  My work here is done, and just look at you now! You're all covered in scauses from your hoof to your brow. Enjoy all your scauses. You look great in your cause. Be sure to give each other lots of applause. I'm off to the next town in my little truck. Have a nice day! Toot a loo!	[]
Cartman	3	1	...Fuck! Dude, weak.	['fuck']
Stan	13	0	It's almost like... like, that guy had this figured out all along.	[]
Jesus	1	0	Yeah...	[]
Stan	15	0	We were trying to do good. But we got everyone duped by a bracelet company.	[]
Jesus	21	0	Yeah, well, I guess we're just gonna have to accept that people aren't gonna think very highly of us.	[]
Stan	15	0	Well... we can't just let that guy get away with taking everyone's money.	[]
Jesus	5	0	What can we possibly do?	[]
Stan	5	0	What would Jesus do?  Yeheah!	[]
Jesus	3	0	Vengeance is mine!	[]
P.F. Pityef	5	0	No please! Please show mercy!	[]
Jesus	2	0	Get out!	[]
Jesus	120	2	Thank you my children.  We've all been through a lot. We got caught up in scauses... that didn't mean squat. They turned my message away from the teachings it hid, and made it about me and the things that I did. Which of course I didn't do. And even if I did use performance-enhancing drugs, so did all the other prophets. But I didn't. So what have we learned from this great wristband theft? Maybe, that when stripped of our scauses, only causes are left. And causes shouldn't be worn on our wrists with a sneer. Let's keep our causes where they belong, which is  right here. On T-shirts!  Free Pussy Riot!	['drugs', 'pussy']
Mr. Mackey	3	1	Free Pussy Riot!	['pussy']
The Boys	1	0	Yeah!	[]
