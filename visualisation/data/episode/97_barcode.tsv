Protesters	2	0	Yeah! Right!	[]
Stuart	22	0	If the Founding Fathers saw you burning your flag an' callin' the President a Nazi, they'd roll over in their grave!	[]
Supporters	2	0	Yeah! Right!	[]

Mr. Garrison	44	0	Well, I hope you little Commies are pretty pleased with yourselves!  Going out there and protesting America, and then saying on national television that you don't even know who the Founding Fathers are! You kids don't know squat about America, do you?!	[]
Butters	5	0	Mmuh well, not really, no.	[]
Mr. Garrison	25	0	Well that's just jingles! Because I'm assigning all you little flag-burners a full report on seventeen seventy-siyix, and the Founding Fathers!	[]
Class	1	0	Awwwwww!	[]
Mr. Garrison	40	0	SHUT UP! I want you all in your study groups of four, and if you can't give an outstanding report on what the Founding Fathers would have to say about all this protesting, then it's Fs for you!	[]
Cartman	18	0	Ugh. UGHuh.  I can't do it! This is waaay too much material for a nine-year-old!	[]
Kyle	29	1	Oh no you don't, Cartman! Every time we get put in a study group, you sit on your ass while the rest of us do all the work!	['ass']
Cartman	16	0	But you guys are such better studiers than me. I know you can pull it off.	[]

Kyle	4	0	What are you doing?	[]
Cartman	7	0	I'm trying to have a flashback.	[]
Kenny	2	0	(A what?)	[]
Cartman	17	0	You know. If I have a flashback, then I can see what 1776 was like first-hand!	[]
Stan	6	0	No, you just have to study.	[]
Cartman	86	0	Nonono. I've seen this work before. Just give me a second.  Oh okay, okay. How about this: Say guys, 1776 was so long ago. I wonder what life would have been like back then?  Back then? Back then? Back then?  Um... Oh waitwait, I know, I know! Heheh, you know guys, I don't even care about 1776. It was so long ago, that I don't think it has anything to do with me.  With me. With... anything to do with me. With me.	[]
Kyle	6	1	That isn't gonna work, dumbass!	['dumbass']
Mr. Slave	18	0	Kids, let's keep it down for study group, or else Mr. Garrison is going to punish me.	[]
Stan	10	0	Just face it, Cartman. You're gonna have to study!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Maaaaa. Meh mameh, Maaaaa!	[]
Skeeter	20	0	There! All finished. From now on, this is the pro-war side of town, and that's the unpatriotic side.	[]
Randy	15	0	How about we call this the rational side of town, and that the redneck side?!	[]
Protesters	2	0	Hahahaha, yeah.	[]
Jimbo	19	0	You just keep all your flag burnin' and your hippie-rock protest songs on YOUR side o' the town!	[]
Protester	12	0	Hey wait a minute, your side of town has the post office.	[]
Stuart	7	0	Well your side has the grocery store.	[]
Jimbo	26	0	Well you can come to our side of town to use the post office and we can go to your side to use the grocery store.	[]
Gerald	12	0	Aaah, can we cross the line to take our kids to school?	[]
Jimbo	24	1	W-hell, naturally you could cross the line for that. Just like ...we could cross the line for hardware, supplies, gas, and pharmaceutical needs.	['hell']
Townsfolk	7	0	Yup, yes sir, yeah, right, uh huh.	[]
Skeeter	40	1	Hey everybody, this is never going to work. Don't you see? All this dividin' up the town, it's just ridiculous. What we really should be doing, is just beatin' the hell out of each other like we were.	['hell']
Randy	10	0	He's right.  Boy, do I feel like a fool.	[]
Kyle	13	1	Cartman, what the hell are you doing?! You're suppsoed to be studying!	['hell']
Cartman	19	0	That's what I'm doing. I'm about to find out all about what happened back in 1776.	[]
Stan	1	0	How?!	[]
Cartman	44	0	All I have to do is be thinking about American history when I walk through this doorway. I'll trip the rope, causing the rock to fall on my head. And then I will have a flashback to the times of our Founding Fathers!	[]
Kyle	9	1	Cartman, you are hereby declared a full-fledged retard!	['retard']
Cartman	38	0	Haha, make fun of me all you want, Kyle! But I will have the last laugh. Gentlemen, if you will clear the doorway, please?  Oh Gee. I wonder what it used to be like in the year 1776.	[]

Randy	26	1	Mayor, our peace rally has always been set for this Saturday! Now, these pro-war bastards are suddenly trying to say they get the town square.	['bastards']
Skeeter	15	1	That's bullcrap, Mayor! Our rally to support the war was set up months ago!	['bullcrap']
Gerald	6	0	There was no war months ago!	[]
Skeeter	12	0	Hey, if you don't like America, then you can git out!	[]
Randy	13	0	Look, nobody wants to hear a bunch of twangy country music prowar proopaganda!	[]
Stuart	11	0	Well nobody wants to hear a bunch o' rock protest songs!	[]
Mr. Mackey	4	0	Well up yours, rednecks!	[]
Townsfolk	9	0	Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble!	[]
Mayor McDaniels	35	0	Quiet people! The town square is public space. That means if neither group will nicely and maturely move the day of its rally, I'll just have to give the town square to both groups.	[]
Jimbo	16	0	All right, that's fine! Because our war support songs will be a thousand times better!	[]
Randy	7	0	Oh, you think so? Bring the shizzle!	[]
Skeeter	9	0	We'll trizzle the shizzle all over the hizzle!	[]
Gerald	10	0	Yeah?! See you Saturday, makizzer shanna sharilla shaz biuznatch gazizzah!	[]

Stan	2	0	Oh no...	[]
Cartman	16	0	Oh yes! I am just about to flash back to the days of our Foundig Fathers!	[]
Kyle	13	1	Cartman, you're supposed to be studying! What the hell is all this?!	['hell']
Cartman	39	0	I have programmed TiVo to record over fifty hours of the History channel. When TiVo is full, both TiVo and I will be dropped into the water, combining our electrowhatever fields and sending me into a flashback of history!	[]
Stan	10	0	Uh Cartman, I think that's a really bad idea.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Or a really sweet one.	[]
TiVo	4	0	Your TiVo is full.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Whoa, here it goes!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Cartman?  Cartman??	[]

Cartman	8	0	Oho yes! I did it I did it!	[]

Cartman	5	2	Oho kick fucking ass, dude!	['fucking', 'ass']
Driver	12	0	Never seen you around here, friend. Might you be from up North?	[]
Cartman	13	0	No, I'm not from here at all. I'm having a flashback.	[]
Driver	6	0	A flashback? Why, what is that?	[]
Cartman	65	1	Well you know, it's a...  H-ho, awesome! 'Look at me, I'm back in time, in 1776.'With gaslight corners, cobblestone streets, and humble houses made of bricks.'What a special magic time, and it's all alive for me'I'm so glad Stan and Kyle aren't here. I hate those guys, seriously.'Seriously hate those guys. Hate Stan and Kyle.	['ho']
Liane	8	0	Is he going to be all right, doctor??	[]
Dr. Doctor	26	0	Your son tried to kill himself in a ritualistic fashion I've never seen before. His chances of surviving are very slim. I'm so sorry.	[]
Liane	7	0	Oh baby baby, you can't die.	[]
Kyle	12	1	Yeah. We have a report to do, asshole! Get up! Get up!!	['asshole']
Liane	3	0	Whoa. Easy, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	24	0	But it's not fair! We have to do a full report on the Founding Fathers, and Cartman got out of helping us again!	[]
Stan	18	0	I gues we're just gonna have to do it with the three of us! Come on, guys!	[]
Liane	22	0	I know you're in a very dark place now, sweetie. But you must come toward the light! Come toward the light!	[]
Driver	11	0	Here we are, then. The current residence of Master Thomas Jefferson.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Super neato!	[]
Driver	9	0	I'm afraid you'll have to wait here.	[]
Cartman	13	0	But, I need to talk to the Founding Fathers to do my report.	[]
Driver	13	0	Sorry. Only the official messenger boy is allowed to talk to Mister Jefferson	[]
Cartman	28	0	Oh, okay.I guess I understand. 'I don't wanna wait for our life to be over...''I don't wanna wait for our life to be over...	[]
Jefferson	5	0	Hello. I am Thomas Jefferson.	[]
Cartman	9	0	And I am the official messenger boy, I am.	[]
Jefferson	9	0	Very well. Take this document to the Continental Congress.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Wow, the Declaration of Independence Day.	[]
Jefferson	16	0	Some favir going to war with England and others want to avoid war at all cost.	[]
Cartman	7	1	It's a bitch, ain't it?	['bitch']
Jefferson	19	0	Perhaps this document will make the reasons for war obvious to all. Good luck, young messenger!  Now make haste!	[]
Stan	13	0	Okay, so Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, then the Continental Congress-	[]
Protesters	6	0	No war! No war! No war!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Oh, Jesus...	[]
Randy	18	0	Uh, boys, would you mind clearing the living room. We have to practice our big war protest song.	[]
Stan	23	0	Dad, we have to study. Mr. Garrison is making us do a presentation on what the Founding Fathers would say about the war.	[]
Mr. Mackey	6	0	Hey... That's a terrific idea!	[]
Gerald	17	0	Yeah! We could have the boys do their presentation as part of our peace rally on Saturday!	[]
Stan	3	0	Oh, no, nononono.	[]
Supporters	9	0	Support our troops! Support our troops! Support our troops!	[]
Skeeter	8	0	See? I told you they had your son.	[]
Stuart	13	0	Kenny. What are you doing over here with all these un-American traitors?!	[]
Kenny	5	0	(I'm doing my homework.)	[]
Randy	23	0	The boys are going to give a presentation at our rally about how the Founding Fathers would agree with our right to protest!	[]
Stan	9	0	Actually, we hadn't really come to a decision-	[]
Stuart	13	0	Look! My son is a patriot and LOVES his country!  Come on, Kenny!	[]
Kenny	3	0	(But Dad, I-)	[]
Stuart	1	0	NOW!	[]
Skeeter	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Supporters	12	0	Support our troops! Support our troops! Support our troops! Support our troops!	[]
Stan	13	0	Kenny, no- ohhh! Awww.  Awww, now we lost two in our study group!	[]
Kyle	2	1	God damnit!	['damnit']
Randy	16	1	Can you believe those hick sons of bitches? Manipulating those kids to be on their side.	['bitches']
Gerald	22	0	Disgraceful! Stan and Kyle, it's up to you to show all those war-mongerers that the Founding Fathers agree with us!	[]
Protester 1	4	0	Yeah, that's right!	[]
Protester 2	3	0	Come on, guys!	[]
Protester 3	4	0	Get back to work!	[]
Kyle	13	1	Do you think kids in every town have to deal with this crap?	['crap']
A voice	11	0	Enter, young messenger.  I am John Hancock, President of the Congress.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Wow.	[]
Hancock	3	0	Mr. John Adams?	[]
Adams	1	0	Aye.	[]
Hancock	12	0	Will you do the honors of reading the document to Congress, please?	[]
Adams	40	1	WHEN in the Course of human Events, it becomes necessary for one Penis to rise up-  -we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.P.S. - Every Thursday should be Free Ice Cream Day.	['penis']
A Congressman	17	0	Excuse me, but does this Declaration actually suggest that we should go to go war with England?	[]
Adams	6	1	We have no choice, Mr. Dickinson.	['dickinson']
Mr. Mackey	15	0	All right everyone, thank you all for comin' out to protest the war, m'kay? .	[]
Skeeter	14	0	Don't kid yourselves. These people have come out to support our troops, right?!	[]
Mr. Mackey	15	0	And now, Randy Marsh is gonna sing a protest song he wrote about the war.	[]
Skeeter	13	0	Oh no you don't! We're doing our pro-war song first!	[]
Jimbo	14	0	Yeah! The last thing these people want is a bleedin'-heart rock protest song!	[]
Mayor McDaniels	10	0	People, I told you, you have to share the stage.	[]
Randy	9	0	Nobody wants to here another pro-war country song!	[]
Skeeter	10	0	Well excuse me if... I'm a little bit country.	[]
Randy	10	0	Well I'm a little bit rock-n-roll-AH!	[]
Skeeter	8	0	I'm a little for supportin' our troops.	[]
Randy	9	0	And I'm a little for bringin' 'em home.	[]
Skeeter	6	0	I believe freedom isn't free.	[]
Randy	8	0	No, but war shouldn't be our goal.	[]
Skeeter	5	0	We must defend our country.	[]
Randy	8	0	If it means war, then we say NO!	[]
Somebody	1	0	Yeehaw!	[]
Skeeter	33	0	'Did you forget them towers in New York?'Did you forget how it made you feel'To see them towers come down?'Were you like me? Did you think it weren't real?	[]
Randy	29	0	I like to rock, but I don't wanna rock Iraq! The only kind of rockin' America should do, is the kind that we can all dance to, yeah!	[]
Skeeter	25	1	We got GPS, ICBMs, and good old-fashioned lead. We're gonna show Saddam what America means; that son of a bitch'll be dead.	['bitch']
Randy	31	0	Why are we fightin' this war?'There's a man in the office we didn't vote for.'They didn't give me a choice.'War is not my voice! Yeaaaaahhhh!	[]
Adams	5	0	We must go to war!	[]
Dickinson	21	0	But what about the violence?! The lives lost?! If we found a country, it should be founded on peace and diplomacy.	[]
Congressman 1	7	0	England will only understand one thing: Force.	[]
Congressman 2	19	0	I must state again for the record that South Carolina, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Georgia are against war!	[]
Congressman 3	32	0	Yeah, because you don't care about the fate of the Colonies like we do! You're all unpatriotic! And if you don't like the Colonies, then you can git out!	[]
Dickinson	40	0	Don't you call us unpatriotic! We're protesting this war because we care so deeply for the fate of our Colonies! You are all unpatriotic for leading the Colonies into a war that half of them don't want!	[]
Cartman	5	0	Whoa, how very very relevant.	[]
Tom	50	0	Tom, I'm standing in the town square where the war rally has been going on for an incredible eighty-seven hours. The crowd still appears to be split right down the middle - half of them support country music, and the other half rock-n-roll. Let's listen in.	[]
Mr. Mackey	32	0	And now we'd like to bring out a couple of very special South Park students who did a report on what the Founding Fathers would have to say about the war.	[]
Protesters	1	0	Booooo!!	[]
Randy	20	0	For you people who still think war is the answer, perhaps you can listen to the voices ... of the children.	[]
Stan	6	0	Uh, we didn't do it.	[]
Mr. Mackey	1	0	What?	[]
Kyle	6	0	We didn't do our homework.	[]
Sharon	15	0	Boys! You were supposed to come out here and tell everyone about the Founding Fathers!	[]
Stan	46	0	Well, first we lost one study partner when Cartman put himself in the hospital, and then they took Kenny away, and then Kyle forgot to set his clock ahead for Dalight Saving, so we couldn't find anything in the history books about Iraq and then-	[]
Skeeter	11	0	That's because the Founding Fathers would have supported the war!	[]
Mr. Mackey	8	0	The Founding Fathers would have protested like us!	[]
Supporters	1	0	Support!	[]
Protesters	1	0	Protest!	[]
Supporters	1	0	Country!	[]
Protesters	3	0	Rock-n-roll!	[]
Congressmen	12	0	Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble!	[]
Dickinson	8	0	We cannot found a country based on war!	[]
Adams	10	0	We cannot found a country that is afraid to fight!	[]
Congressman	1	0	Rabble!	[]
Congressmen	21	0	Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble!  Oh my, it's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin.	[]
Cartman	13	0	Oh, it's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin.	[]
Hancock	10	0	Mr. Franklin, where do you stand on the war issue?	[]
Franklin	60	0	I believe that if we are to form a new country, we cannot be a country that appears war-hungry and violent to the rest of the world. However, we also cannot be a country that appears weak and unwilling to fight to the rest of the world. So, what if we form a country that appears to want both?	[]
Jefferson	17	0	Yes. Yes of course. We go to war, and protest going to war at the same time.	[]
Dickinson	26	0	Right. If the people of our new country are allowed to do whatever they wish, then some will support the war and some will protest it.	[]
Franklin	46	0	And that means that as a nation, we could go to war with whomever we wished, but at the same time, act like we didn't want to. If we allow the people to protest what the government does, then the country will be forever blameless.	[]
Adams	10	0	It's like having your cake, and eating it, too.	[]
Congressman 2	14	0	Think of it: an entire nation founded on saying one thing and doing another.	[]
Hancock	11	0	And we will call that country the United States of America.	[]
Cartman	28	0	Wow, I get it now! I get it!  Whoa, here it goes. I wish I could go back to my time. To my time, to, to my time.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Wow!	[]
Cartman	3	0	Everyone, stop! Please!	[]
Townsman	8	0	The-the child! The child, from the hospital.	[]
Cartman	22	0	If you all don't mind, I would like to do my report now. I know what the founding fathers would say.	[]
Stan	2	0	He does?	[]
Kyle	2	0	He does?	[]
Cartman	125	1	I learned somethin' today. This country was founded by some of the smartest thinkers the world has ever seen. And they knew one thing: that a truly great country can go to war, and at the same time, act like it doesn't want to.  You people who are for the war, you need the protesters. Because they make the country look like it's made of sane, caring individuals. And you people who are anti-war, you need these flag-wavers, because, if our whole country was made up of nothing but soft pussy protesters, we'd get taken down in a second. That's why the founding fathers decided we should have both. It's called having your cake and eating it too.	['pussy']
Randy	18	0	He's right. The strength of this country is the ability to do one thing and say another.	[]
Skeeter	26	0	Yeah, but... if it weren't for all you guys protesting, why everyone around the world would hate the American people instead of just the President.	[]
Gerald	22	0	And if it weren't for you people flexing your arms, America could easily get taken over by terrorists or... or China.	[]
Mr. Mackey	7	0	I guess we... owe you an apology.	[]
Stuart	8	0	Eh-ah, I guess we owe you one.	[]
Townsfolk	1	0	Awww.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Cartman? Cartman saved the day?	[]
Stan	3	0	Can't be	[]
Cartman	24	1	The Founding Fathers want you all to know that we can disagree all we want, as long as we agree that America kicks ass.	['ass']
Skeeter	7	0	Hey I'm a little bit country	[]
Randy	10	0	And I'm a little bit rock-n-roll-AH!	[]
Skeeter	7	0	I'll be the muscle of America	[]
Randy	8	0	And me, I'll be the caring soul.	[]
Together	25	0	And when you put us together you get a nation with one goal  To thrive and prosper, with a little country and rock and roll.	[]
Randy	5	0	Come on up here, everybody!	[]
Everybody	15	0	We're a little bit country, and we're a little bit rock-n-roll	[]
Stuart	9	0	We can be a nation that believe in war,	[]
Mr. Mackey	9	0	And still tells the world that we don't.	[]
Everybody	26	0	Let the flag for hypocrisy fly high from every pole  Cuz we're a little bit country, and we're a little bit rock-n-roll.	[]
Randy	13	0	Well, goodnight everybody. It sure has been great bringing you a hundred episodes.	[]
Skeeter	15	0	We want to thank our guests, the pro-war people.  And the anti-war people.	[]
Stan	7	1	What the hell are they doing now?	['hell']
Kyle	5	0	I-I don't know.	[]
Everybody	11	0	For the war, against, the war, WHO CARES?? One hundred episodes!	[]
Kyle	9	0	I hate this town. I-I really really do.	[]
