Butters	11	0	Fellas! Fellas! It's- Ohmygod! You're not gonna believe this!	[]
Stan	4	0	Dude, Butters, calm down.	[]
Butters	39	0	Okay.  Okay. I was talking to Pete Wetchney, and he said that Danny Chadwick said that his sister told him that the girls in our class have a list that rates every boy's looks from cutest to ugliest.	[]
Craig	8	0	So who do they say is the cutest?	[]
Butters	2	0	I donno.	[]
Token	7	0	Who do they say is the ugliest?	[]
Butters	21	0	I don't know. Ih it's like a girl thing. They won't let anybody see the list but them.	[]
Cartman	15	0	They can't do that. Who are they to judge us on how we look?	[]
Stan	15	0	Yeah. You think they rate us just for looks, or they take personality into account?	[]
Clyde	11	0	If it's just looks then I think I'm safe.	[]
Kyle	18	0	You guys, who cares if the girls make some stupid list? Girls make dumb lists all the time.	[]
Cartman	13	0	Yeah, Kyle's right. Screw it; we have better things to worry about.	[]
Craig	17	0	You're just saying that because you know you're gonna be very last on the list!	[]
Cartman	16	0	Oh please, I don't think so, Craig! Chicks think I'm way hotter than you!	[]
Craig	14	1	You don't think they put the fat tub of tard at the bottom?	['fat']
Cartman	33	2	No, because people know I'm not fat! I'm buff. They probably put you at the bottom of the list because you have fucked up teeth! Or Kenny cause' he's poor	['fat', 'fucked']
Kenny	10	0	(They didn't put me at the bottom, did they?)	[]
Cartman	17	0	Kenny, face it: Girls don't wanna Pop Tarts for dinner every night when they get married.	[]
Butters	25	0	You don't think they said I'm the ugliest boy in the class, do ya? Well if they did, my parents will ground me.	[]
Kyle	20	0	You guys, do you really care what a bunch of girls have to say about how you rank in looks?!	[]
Cartman	8	0	All right, Bebe, let's see the list.	[]
Bebe	1	0	What??	[]
Cartman	21	1	You know what I'm talking about, bitch! The list where you rate the looks of each boy in the class!	['bitch']
Bebe	20	0	That's not for boys to look at! It's a secret girl list and YOU can't see it!	[]
Cartman	23	0	Craig is on the bottom, right? Or is it Kenny 'cause you'd be eating Pop Tarts for dinner if you married him.	[]
Bebe	25	0	I'm not...  telling! And anyway, I'm not the list keeper, Nelly is! And Nelly will never let you look at it, so there!	[]
Cartman	6	3	Fuck you Bebe! Fuck you bitch!	['fuck', 'fuck', 'bitch']
Butters	13	0	Well, I guess we're never gonna get that list from the girls.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Screw that, dude! We're guys. We can outthink them.	[]
Cartman	51	0	All right, here's what we know. That chick Nelly is the one who's in charge of holding the list, right. She apparently keeps it in a purple Pee Chee folder, and we need a plan to get it from her.  This is what I call Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail	[]
Butters	1	0	Neato!	[]
Cartman	60	1	At 1. p.m. tomorrow, Nelly will have to walk from Home Ec to Social Studies. That's our best time to strike. As she makes her way through Hallway 3, Craig will be ready with a distraction device here.  When she stops and turns to Craig in the hallway, Butters will run up and kick her in the balls.	['balls']
Butters	2	0	O-kay!	[]
Cartman	34	1	Once Butters kicks her in the balls, she'll fall to the floor, dropping the Pee Chee, and Kenny will swoop in from Corridor 3-Delta, and grab the Pee Chee. Are we good?	['balls']
Nelly	12	1	Ow! What'dja do that for?!  Hey, what's your problem, asshole?!	['asshole']
Cartman	2	0	Bail, bail!	[]
Cartman	17	1	Okay, our mission failed, but we've learned a lot. Primarily that girls do not have balls.	['balls']
Butters	4	0	They sure don't.	[]
Cartman	39	0	Never mind, because we are going to Plan B, one that I call Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail A Second Time. When Nelly leaves the cafeteria for recess, Kenny will jump in front of her and spit on the ground.	[]
Butters	13	1	You think maybe girls keep their balls on the inside of their tummies?	['balls']
Cartman	12	1	Butters, we're done talkin' about girls' balls right now! Pay attention!	['balls']
Cartman	6	0	We got it! We got it!	[]
Craig	7	0	We got the list from the girls!	[]
Nelly	6	0	Give that back you dirty buttholes!	[]
Cartman	10	0	Tape it to the wall, Kenny! Jason, watch the door!	[]
Clyde	11	0	All right, hurry! Get it up there! Let's see it!	[]
A Boy	2	0	Hurry hurry!	[]
Craig	8	0	Whoa, what's this thing? Where am I?	[]
Clyde	5	0	What number am I on?	[]
A Boy	4	0	Is it set up?	[]
Stan	13	0	It's listed in order from cutest to ugliest. Clyde's number one.	[]
Clyde	5	0	Me?  I'm the cutest?	[]
Stan	6	0	And then Token, and then me.	[]
Token	5	0	I'm number two? Wow.	[]
Butters	14	0	Come on, let me see!  Oh boy! I'm number 11! Whoopie! Number 11!	[]
Craig	10	1	Ah! Look at that! I'm hotter than you, fatso!	['fatso']
Cartman	4	1	What?! That's bullcrap!	['bullcrap']
Kenny	1	0	(Woohoo!)	[]
Kyle	31	0	Oh, so big deal, guys! Do you feel better now? Clyde's the best looking kid in the class. And then Token and Stan, and last is Francis, Cartman, and...  Me?	[]
Cartman	4	0	You're last, dude!	[]
Kyle	2	0	No way.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Yes way! Check it out!	[]
Stan	8	0	Cartman, lay off! You're next to last.	[]
Cartman	23	0	So? I'm hotter than Kyle.  I'm better looking than Kyyyle!  Yes! I'm hotter than Kyyyle! I'm hotter than Kyyyle!	[]
Kyle	4	0	I'm last? Last?	[]
Stan	8	0	Dude, it's just a stupid list, remember?	[]
Kyle	10	0	I got voted the ugliest boy in the whole class?	[]
Stan	7	0	Who cares what dumb girls think, right?	[]
Butters	14	0	Mom, Dad! I'm not the ugliest kid in the class! Kyle Broflovski is!	[]
Steven	5	0	Well good for you, Butters.	[]
Linda	4	0	Way to go, champ.	[]
Butters	1	0	Whoopie!	[]
Steven	9	0	Well, guess we don't have to ground him.	[]
Sheila	10	0	Kyle, what's the matter? You barely touched your knishes.	[]
Kyle	14	0	The... girls at school. They made a list and voted me the ugliest boy.	[]
Sheila	9	0	Wwwhat? That's ridiculous. My little bubbeleh is adorable!	[]
Kyle	23	0	Llook, I know I'm not the best-looking guy in town, but I I didn't think I was the very ugliest.	[]
Sheila	17	0	You're not ugly, Kyle. You're my perfect little man. You look just like your father.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Oh God! I do?	[]
Gerald	7	0	But he has his mother's nose.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Ahahah!	[]
Sheila	10	0	Kyle, you are very handsome and perfect in every way.	[]
Kyle	30	0	Ike, Ike, you have to be honest. Am I ugly, yes or no?  You ALL think I'm ugly. Jesus Christ, the least you could have done is told me!	[]
Sheila	4	0	Kyle, come back here!	[]
Cartman	16	0	I'm better-looking than you!  The girls think I'm better-looking than you, Kyle!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Hrrgh!	[]
Cartman	22	0	Dude, Kyle. Can you hear me? They totally think I'm hotter than you are.  Kyle! Kyle, I'm more attractive.  Kyle?	[]
Martha	9	0	Clyde, it's time to be getting to bed.	[]
Clyde	19	0	Hey, what's goin' on?  What's goin on? Hey.  Oh yeah, hey, whassup? What's goin' on? Nice.	[]
Clyde	5	0	Hey, what's goin' on?	[]
Two Girls	2	0	Hey Clyde.	[]
Clyde	1	0	Hey.	[]
Anne	2	0	Hi Clyde.	[]
Clyde	4	0	What's goin' on?	[]
Butters	2	0	Hey ugly!	[]
Clyde	33	0	Hey, Kyle. Look man, it doesn't matter what people think, okay?  You know, Abraham Lincoln was pretty ugly too, but look what he accomplished.  Chin up, cowboy.  Hey, what's goin' on?	[]
Girl	6	0	Oh, not much, just hanging around-	[]
Butters	8	0	Hehehe. Hey, nice... nice ears, haha. Pizza Face!	[]
Clyde	13	0	Butters, that's not cool, man.  He can't help how he looks.	[]
Cartman	36	0	Kyle, I was going to suggest that maybe you should... hang out with the other ugly kids in the school. Because if you hang out with them, you won't stand out so much. Right?  Cool.	[]
Blonde Boy	1	0	Hey.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Hello.	[]
Bushy Eyebrows Boy	7	0	Are you going to eat your pickle?	[]
Craig	14	0	Could somebody toss the football back? Its over there next to the ugly kids.	[]
Big-Eared Boy	10	0	I hate coming to this school. It makes me angry.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Big-Eared Boy	16	0	Sometimes I just want to burn it down. Burn the whole school down to the ground!	[]
Kyle	10	0	No. You know what? Screw this! We aren't ugly!	[]
Fat Girl	3	0	We're not?	[]
Kyle	15	0	No! Maybe we all just need a little image change, you know? Like a makeover.	[]
Bushy Eyebrows Boy	2	0	Hey yeah.	[]
Kyle	28	0	Like you! Maybe you just need to let your hair down. And let's see how you look without those glasses.  Let's just... put those back on.	[]
Lola	7	0	I know, that song is so awesome.	[]
Stan	7	0	Uh Wendy. Could I talk to you?	[]
Wendy	3	0	Of course, Stan.	[]
Stan	6	0	Just for a minute. Over here.	[]
Lola	12	0	You think he's gonna beg her to come back to him?	[]
Wendy	14	0	This is a nice surprise. I thought you were never speaking to me again.	[]
Stan	13	0	Yeah well, I wanna talk to you about this list you girls made.	[]
Wendy	8	0	Which one? We make lists all the time.	[]
Stan	25	0	The one where you rated the boys' looks in the class. Look, it really messed Kyle up, okay? How could you vote him the ugliest?	[]
Wendy	26	0	Look, personally, I didn't vote him the ugliest. My vote was for Eric Cartman. But enough of the other girls must have felt he was-	[]
Stan	12	0	So it wasn't unanimous. Maybe you can just change the list.	[]
Wendy	35	0	Change the list?! Do you have any idea what that would take?! Maybe you don't understand how important list-making is to girls! It's just not something we do flippantly! There's protocol!	[]
Stan	21	0	Can't we just talk to all the girls who made the list and find out why they voted Kyle last?	[]
Wendy	20	0	All right, I'll try and get you into our next list-making meeting. But it won't be easy.	[]
Bebe	13	0	Today's list meeting is called to order. Rebecca, you have the floor.	[]
Rebecca	19	0	If it pleases and sparkles I suggest we continue deliberations on List 47D: Which Girl Has The Cutest Purse?	[]
Bebe	14	0	Rebecca moves we work on List 47D. Does that sparkle with all the girls?	[]
Girls	1	0	Sunshine.	[]
Lola	11	0	Deliberating Which Girl Has The Cutest Purse? Millie has the floor.	[]
Millie	24	0	If it pleases and sparkles, I would like to submit that  Jennifer's purse is by far the cutest. Definitely cuter than Teresa's.	[]
Blond Girl	24	0	I don't think anyone here disagrees that Jennifer's purse is cuter than Teresa's, but it doesn't make it the cutest.	[]
Bebe	17	0	The committee has already decided that nothing with stripes can be in the Top 5 cutest purses.	[]
Lola	6	0	Sunshine sparkle Wendy has the floor.	[]
Wendy	21	0	If it pleases and sparkles, I would like to suggest that we...  That we reopen last week's list for debate.	[]
Girls	9	0	What'd she say? She's gotta be kidding!	[]
Heidi	3	0	Is she crazy?	[]
Bebe	9	0	All right, all right, come before the Rainbow Railing.	[]
Wendy	2	0	Go ahead.	[]
Stan	16	0	Aaah, I was just thinking that maybe you voted a little... hastily on the cutest boy?	[]
Rebecca	7	0	You thought you should be number one?	[]
Stan	1	0	NO.	[]
Bebe	13	0	Let me assure you that no list is made hastily by this committee!	[]
Wendy	18	0	He didn't mean that. He was just saying maybe we should open it up again for discussion.	[]
Bebe	34	0	I cannot by Sparkle Law move to have an old list investigated. However, if you can find recourse for such an inquiry, Wendy, I would review it. Does that sparkle with all the girls?	[]
Girls	1	0	Sunshine.	[]
Kyle	20	0	They all laugh at me!  And the girls giggle behind my back!  unable to even glance at my disfigured face.	[]
A Voice	7	0	Do not burn down the school, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Who said that?	[]
A Voice	8	0	I did.  Do you know who I am?	[]
Kyle	2	0	Abraham Lincoln?	[]
Abraham Lincoln	203	0	I am Abraham Lincoln. Burning down the school will not solve your problems. You think you've been cheated because you are ugly, but I am here to show you otherwise. Come! There is much to see.  I want you to look in here.  This woman is Nancy Pinkerton. As a child she was consistently the most beautiful girl in her entire school. Her life as a youth was filled with praises, and everything being handed to her. Boys told her she was special. She was funny. She was interesting. But that's only because she was hot. It wasn't until she reached age 40, when her looks started to fade, that she learned she was actually about as interesting and special, as a wet carrot.  This is the home of your new ugly friend, Yamal.  Because he's ugly, he gets nothing handed to him. He has to work at making something of himself. But that work is gonna pay off when he's an adult. He will have character, something that kids who are hot rarely develop. Like your classmate, Clyde.  Now that he knows he's good-looking, he doesn't have to make any effort to be special.	[]
Clyde	21	0	Naw, Rebecca's just a friend. I wanna be with you now. Sure, yeah, I'll buy you some shoes too.	[]
Abraham Lincoln	50	1	Now his life will be about girls. Chatting with them on the phone and buying them shoes. He will most likely marry very young, and not realize until age 40 that he's a total douche. And so you see, Kyle, it is actually the beautiful kids that are cursed.	['douche']
Kyle	17	0	But I can't wait to be an adult to be happy. That's forever from now.	[]
Abraham Lincoln	4	0	You must be patient.	[]
Kyle	14	0	Just take me home! I don't wanna be here anymore! Take me home!	[]
Abraham Lincoln	2	0	Very well.	[]
Abraham Lincoln	11	0	Kyle, you need to think about what I've told you.	[]
Kyle	16	0	I don't want to! I don't want anybody telling me how to feel anymore!	[]
Abraham Lincoln	8	2	Well then you're just a fucking asshole!	['fucking', 'asshole']
Wendy	36	0	Wait a minute. Wait, Stan, I think I've got something!  Take a look at this: during final deliberation of the list for cutest boy, seven girls gave Clyde a glitter rating of only one sparkle.	[]
Stan	9	0	I have no idea what you're talking about.	[]
Wendy	23	0	It doesn't add up. It is possible that Rebecca made a mistake when she tallied the sunshine votes onto the final list.	[]
Rebecca	3	0	Oh, hey Wendy.	[]
Wendy	17	0	Hey Rebecca. Do you still have the voter cards for the list that rated the boys' looks?	[]
Rebecca	8	0	Oho Wendy, we're done with that list.	[]
Wendy	32	0	I know, but I think there's been a mistake. Six of the girls I've talked to didn't vote Clyde the cutest. That means that mathematically he should have been-	[]
Rebecca	41	0	All right, you need to stop. Digging. Around, Wendy!  You might not like... what you find!  Just back off and stop asking questions!  You're getting close to a secret that I don't think you can handle! Let it... go!	[]
Stan	8	0	That didn't sparkle with her, did it?	[]
Clerk	26	0	One canister of propane, six cans of lighter fluid,  seven gallons of high-octane kerosene, and a box of matches.  Okay, is that everything, little boy?	[]
Kyle	6	0	That should just about do it.	[]
Jerry	12	0	Do you like to put this on your True-Value card today?	[]
Wendy	48	0	Nonorary Chair, Mrs. Secretary, I believe a member of our committee has tampered with one of our lists. I've compiled a full report, and it turns out that nobody voted Claude the cutest in the class. I believe Rebecca changed the list to make him number one.	[]
Lola	5	0	Why would she do that?	[]
Wendy	25	0	Right after the list was made, Rebecca started going out with Clyde. You can read all the discrepancies here.  We need to remake that list.	[]
Jenny	7	0	You just couldn't let it go!	[]
Wendy	9	0	Uh, what do you mean? Call the girls in.	[]
Jenny	9	0	I'm afraid we can't do that, Wendy!	[]
Lola	39	0	Did you know, Wendy, that Clyde's father own the shoe store at the mall? A lot of us have always wanted to date Clyde to get free shoes, but we couldn't, because he wasn't popular enough.	[]
Wendy	2	0	You knew!	[]
Lola	30	0	Unfortunately, the members voted Clyde in the bottom five of the list! That's why we had to manipulate the votes, forge a new list, and... hide the real one!	[]
Wendy	33	0	So that you all could justify dating Clyde and get shoes?! How dare you take advantage of your position! I'm gonna tell Bebe and have you both disbarred from the list committee!	[]
Jenny	8	0	Bebe?! Who do you think authorized the buyout?!	[]
Wendy	3	0	No. Not Bebe.	[]
Jenny	11	0	She's dating Clyde now. Nobody loves shoes more than her.	[]
Stan	4	0	What's going on?	[]
Wendy	13	0	When the other girls find out you ignored their votes, they're gonna-	[]
Jenny	29	0	Do you really think they'll believe you over the heads of the committee?! We'll simple generate a new list! Biggest Liars! And put you at the top!	[]
Lola	15	0	Do yourself a favor, Wendy! Just let it go! And keep your little mouth shut!	[]
Wendy	5	0	I don't think so!	[]
Lola	1	0	AAGH!	[]
Wendy	2	0	Stan, run!	[]
Stan	2	0	Jesus, dude!	[]
Stan	17	0	Hey, kid, have you seen Kyle? We've looked everywhere and we have to show him something.	[]
Yamal	6	0	He's burning down the school.	[]
Wendy	1	0	What?	[]
Yamal	11	0	He said he gonna burn the school down to the ground.	[]
Kyle	21	0	All the cruel jokes and ridicule will finally be over! Are you happy now, God?! YOU made me look like this!	[]
Stan	4	0	Kyle! Kyle, don't!	[]
Kyle	19	0	Don't try and stop me, Stan! You don't know how it feels to be a deformed monstrosity!	[]
Stan	6	0	The list was a forgery, Kyle!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Huh??	[]
Stan	13	0	It didn't sparkle with all the girls. We have the real list.	[]
A Girl	10	0	That's about far enough!  Give me that list, Wendy!	[]
Kyle	5	0	Stan, what is going on?!	[]
Stan	14	0	It was about shoes, Kyle. The girls wanted shoes, so they set you up.	[]
Bebe	26	0	Kyle was simple a casualty! To move Clyde meant that Craig has to be moved to number twelve, which moved Jimmy down and moved Jason up!	[]
Kyle	5	0	So what number was I??	[]
Wendy	7	0	You've compromised everything! Our lists' integrity!	[]
Bebe	9	0	Did you seeee these shoes, Wendy?!  They're incredible!	[]
Wendy	17	0	It doesn't matter how incredible they are; you can't- Oh my God, those are amazing.	[]
Bebe	1	0	Right?	[]
Wendy	7	0	Is that a lace across the top?	[]
Bebe	6	0	No, it's a little strap.	[]
Stan	1	0	Wendy!	[]
Wendy	11	0	Oh, but it doesn't matter. You took it too far!	[]
Bebe	16	0	If you hadn't gone all Nancy Drew on us, this would have just gone away!	[]
Kyle	5	0	She's gonna kill us?	[]
Wendy	22	0	It's too late, Bebe. I've already made a full report and sent a copy to the police. People will know.	[]
Bebe	5	0	Oh please, you're lying.	[]
Officer	23	0	Give it up, Bebe. We know all about it. The list was compromised. Kyle Broflovski is not the ugliest boy in the class.	[]
Stan	1	0	Wendy!	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Aah-)	[]
Bebe	8	0	Wait, I, I didn't do anything wrong.	[]
Officer	6	0	You can explain all that downtown.	[]
Stan	20	0	Here, Kyle.  We've been through a lot, but, you can finally see where you really are on the list.	[]
Stan	9	0	Are you sure you're okay with this, Kyle?	[]
Kyle	26	1	I'm sure. Abe Lincoln was right: I don't wanna find out I'm good-looking and become a total shithead when I grow up.	['shithead']
Stan	2	0	...Abe Lincoln?	[]
Wendy	23	0	Stan, it's been really great hanging out with you again. I feel like you've changed somehow. In a really awesome way.	[]
Stan	14	0	Yeah well, I guess a lot of things... change, don't they?  Bwaaaagh! Bwaaaagh!	[]
