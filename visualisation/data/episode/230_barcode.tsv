Kyle	4	0	Just tell us, Butters.	[]
Butters	17	0	There's a new girl that started school here today. And she's joined the cheerleading squad.	[]
Craig	6	0	Oh, we have a new cheerleader?	[]
Clyde	5	0	What's she look like?	[]
Kenny	5	0	(Yeah, what's her name?)	[]
Cartman	37	0	Alright guys, alright! If there is a new girl at our school, we're not gonna start putting claims on her and getting into big fights! It's gonna be her choice who she likes the most.	[]
Butters	5	0	Theh theh, there she is.	[]
Cartman	18	0	Oh my God. Token, aren't you stoked?  Aww, that's awesome, Token. I'm happy for you.	[]
Token	7	0	Why?! Why are you happy for me?!	[]
Cartman	19	0	Dude, I'm being seriously. You guys will be really cute together. What are you gonna say to her?	[]
Token	1	0	Nothing!	[]
Cartman	12	0	What the? ...Oh, Token's shy. Oh my God, that is adorable.	[]
Mr. Garrison	163	0	And so what we start to see now is a pattern in world history much like the Greeks and the Romans. Remember that there were seven families fighting for control of the land of Westeroth. The king of Westeroth was who? Robert Baratheon , and he asked Eddard, also known as, of course, Lord Stark, to serve as hand of the king. You remember that Lord Stark accepted, or course. The queen's family - that's the Lannisters - were really trying back then to take control, weren't they? But where were the Targaryens at this time? Well, they were across the sea. We all talked about how they were also trying to take the throne. So we've got the Greeks, the Romans, the Starks, Lannisters, Baratheons, Targaryens, all headed for a big blowout right in Season 2. Now, what I really wanted to get into today is what was going on in the north, because that's just a whole other mess-	[]
Cartman	16	0	Dude... Token!  Token. Dude.  Psst. Token.  Go ahead. Go ahead dude. Token! Yeah, get in there.	[]
Kyle	6	1	Will you shut the hell up?!	['hell']
Cartman	11	0	...Token. Do you want me to pass her a jelly bean?	[]
Token	1	0	No!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Huh?	[]
Token	1	0	NO.	[]
Mr. Garrison	5	0	Token, is there a problem?	[]
Cartman	15	1	Ah he's just a little sick, Mr. Garrison. He's got boneritis.  Right guys?	['boneritis']
Mr. Garrison	41	0	Everyone pay attention!  Now, what I really wanna get into today is what was going on in the north, because that's just a whole other mess that's pretty hard to keep straight, isn't it? The Night's Watch-	[]
Cartman	4	0	Token.  Dude, dude. Dude.	[]
Red	19	0	So then Kelly I guess told Stacey that she wasn't invited, so now Stacey's pissed at us.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Hey, guys? Can I talk to you?	[]
Bebe	1	0	Why?!	[]
Cartman	19	0	Just, could I talk to you, real quick?  What kind of stuff is the new girl saying about Token?	[]
Red	3	0	About Token? Why?	[]
Cartman	18	0	Well, Token's really shy, so, I'm just here, sort of on his behalf 'cause, you know.	[]
Bebe	3	0	Token likes Nichole?	[]
Cartman	4	0	W-yeah, of course.	[]
Red	10	0	Oh yeah, I don't think she has any idea.	[]

Red	3	0	That boy Token.	[]
Wendy	13	0	Oh he's really nice, Nichole. I dated him for a little while.	[]
Nichole	18	0	Oh gee, thanks you guys, but to be totally honest, I kinda think this other boy is cute.	[]
Bebe	2	0	Who? Whowhowhowho?	[]

Nichole	6	0	Oh no, who told you that?	[]
Cartman	29	0	Just, the grapevine. Um, there's something you should probably know.  Oh man this is hard. Um, the thing is, me and Kyle are kind of, you know, ...together?	[]
Nichole	1	0	Ohhh.	[]
Cartman	45	0	Yeah, he's my man. I'm more out than Kyle is, but... it's tough, because he acts like we're not a couple at school because he's embarrassed, but... we get home and he's the best boyfriend I've ever had.	[]
Nichole	16	0	Wow, ah I'm sorry. I totally respect that.  Hey, thanks a lot for telling me.	[]
Cartman	21	0	Cool, just, you know, don't touch me 'cause I'm not into girls, so it kind of grosses me out.	[]
Nichole	4	0	Oh, I'm sorry.	[]
Cartman	16	1	Yeah, kewl. Anyway, thanks a lot and just, you know, stay away from my man, bitch.	['bitch']
Nichole	19	0	Hey, uh, I just wanna let you know, if you ever need somebody to talk to, I'm here.	[]
Kyle	9	0	Oh, thanks.  Dude, that new girl's into me!	[]
Cartman	24	0	Psst Butters. Butters!  At the end of PE class, tell Nichole that the gym teacher wants some towels delivered to the boys' locker room.	[]
Butters	2	0	How come?	[]
Cartman	17	0	Let's just say that by this time tomorrow, Token and Nichole are gonna be practically married.	[]
Butters	15	0	Are you sure, Eric? I mean, maybe they just aren't meant for each other.	[]
Cartman	26	0	No no.  Love is like taking a dump, Butters. Sometimes it works itself out, but sometimes, you've gotta give it a nice hard slimy push.	[]
Butters	14	0	Oh hey, Nichole? Coach wants you to take these to the boys' locker room.	[]
Nichole	4	0	Oh, he does?  Okay.	[]

Stan	8	0	Dude, why are you so into their relationship?	[]
Cartman	9	0	I don't know, it's just so... perfect.	[]
Kyle	2	1	You motherfucker!	['motherfucker']
Cartman	3	0	Kyle, Jesus Christ!	[]
Kyle	14	2	What the hell are you doing telling people that we're a gay couple?!	['hell', 'gay']
Cartman	8	0	Oh, heard that through the grapevine, did you?	[]
Kyle	11	0	The new girl liked me, and so you lied to her!	[]
Cartman	18	0	Somebody had to intervene, Kyle! You were standing in the way of Token and Nichole! They belong together!	[]
Kyle	21	2	Just because two people are the same race doesn't mean they belong together, you fat racist piece of fucking garbage!	['fat', 'fucking']
Cartman	38	0	Oh! Oh, I'm a I'm a racist, huh?! I'm a racist! It's how nature works, Kyle! Look! Look, what about Luke Covina and Maria Sanchez?  Is it a coincidence that they ended up together?!	[]
Stan	19	0	Actually, I heard they're together because they got locked in the school gym overnight a few months ago.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Oh did they? Uh I hadn't heard about that.	[]
Cupid Me	6	0	Teehee, that was us, remember, Eric?	[]

Nichole	8	0	His name is Token. He's really nice.	[]
Dad	14	0	Well that's good. But... your mother tells me that this boy is... black.	[]
Nichole	1	0	So?	[]
Dad	46	0	Well, Nichole, it's just... You know, just because you're black doesn't mean you can only date black boys. It's just a little weird that we moved to this whole new place and you're immediately drawn to the one other black person.	[]
Mom	13	0	Oh stop, William. There's nothing wrong with her dating a black person.	[]
William	39	0	But I'm not saying it's wrong, I'm just saying... she's gonna have to deal with racist people out there! People turning their heads and saying, Oh, look at the two black people together. That figures!	[]
Nichole	27	0	It's not like that, Dad. We just happen to like each other. I know it seems like a strange coincidence, but it really is. A coincidence.	[]
Mom	13	0	And we are very happy for you, sweetheart. Here, have some more turkey.	[]
William	21	0	Yeah, just try the white meat. I know it's a little dry, but... there's a lot more of it.	[]
Cartman	17	0	Come on!  Other people have to use the bathroom, you know? Can you hurry up in there?!	[]
Cupid Me	2	0	Teeheeheehee, heeheehee.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Jesus Christ, Cupid Me, you givin' birth in there?!	[]
Cupid Me	1	0	Sorry.	[]
Cartman	14	1	That-s al- Oh, Cupid Me!  Sick! What the fuck have you been eating?!	['fuck']
Cupid Me	1	0	Heeheeheeheeheehee.	[]
Cartman	15	0	Dude, at least flush the toilet!  Aww, it's cute, it's little chocolate hearts.	[]

Token	1	0	Oh.	[]
Nichole	20	0	I'm so sorry. It's just... I don't believe we're really on the same page, you know?	[]
Token	1	0	Okay...	[]
Nichole	9	0	I think you're really great... Ww-we just...	[]
Token	6	0	I think, you're really great.	[]
Nichole	3	0	...I'm sorry.	[]
Token	10	0	Yeah. I'm sorry too. I'll see you around.	[]
Nichole	1	0	Okay.	[]
Cartman	8	0	It's not fair! They were so... happy!	[]
Butters	6	0	It's gonna be okay, Eric.	[]
Cartman	17	0	It's NOT gonna be okay! Why did they break up?! They were meant for each other!	[]
Butters	6	0	They'll find love somewhere else.	[]
Cartman	4	0	No, they won't!	[]
Butters	3	0	Yes, they will.	[]
Cartman	11	2	No, they won't! Fuck you Butters, you're an asshole!	['fuck', 'asshole']
Cupid Me	11	0	Teeheehee. Looks like somebody could use a little arrow of sunshine.	[]
Cartman	9	0	And you! I should never have believed in you!	[]
Butters	4	0	In...in who, Eric?	[]
Cartman	12	0	I never wanna see you again!  Take! Your sunshine! And frakin'! Die!	[]

Man	62	0	I work hard, so I need a laxative that works hard too!  I can't be constipated on the job.  That's why I need... Soft Serve.  Because when I'm constipated, sometimes even a hard push isn't enough.  Don't give up. Get back in there and get to work!  'Cause when the going gets tough, the tough gets going!	[]
Cartman	40	0	That's right... That's right!  Ohhh.  I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have doubted you. Please come back. I know I got a little angry but... I believe in you. Do you hear me? I believe in you.	[]
