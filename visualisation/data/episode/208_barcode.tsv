Mint-Berry Crunch	195	0	Sit back, justice believers, and listen to another edition of America's favorite superhero, Mint-Berry Crunch!  Our story begins in a remote corner of the Gulf of Mexico.  The BP Oil Company drills into the ocean floor,  but they drill too much, and the BP Oil Company accidentally unleashes Cthulhu, an ancient evil god from another dimension. Halfway across the country,  a mild-mannered attractive fourth-grader, Bradley Biggle, hears of the disaster on the news while with his friends.  But Bradley Biggle is no ordinary fourth-grader! Not long ago, he realized he had superpowers he could call upon by turning in place and saying the magic word, Shablagoo! And in a flash, Bradley is transformed into the thrilling superhero, Mint-Berry Crunch! Joined by the other Coon Friends, Mint-Berry Crunch went to investigate the Gulf spill crisis! The superheroes came across a cult, in existence for years, that had been waiting for Cthulhu's arrival. They are the key to stopping Cthulhu from taking over the world! Sometimes, when everything seems hopeless, that's when you need to bring it all.  That's when you need... to bring the Crr-runch!	[]
Toolshed	18	0	Dude, I'm sorry, but we still aren't getting it. You're half man and half berry?	[]
Mint-Berry Crunch	1	0	Rrright!	[]
Human Kite	7	0	But then what exactly is your superpower?	[]
Mint-Berry Crunch	12	0	The power of mint and berries yet with a satisfying tasty crunch!	[]
Toolshed	26	0	...Nah, see, that's the problem dude, that's not really a superpower. Like, I have mental command over all power tools, Human Kite can fly-	[]
Human Kite	7	0	And shoot lasers out of my eyes.	[]
Toolshed	16	0	And shoot lasers out of his eyes. And Mysterion can...  Wait, what's your superpower Mysterion?	[]
Mysterion	4	0	I can't die!	[]
Toolshed	13	0	...Oh yeah, good one. Mysterion can't die, and Iron Maiden is indestructible-	[]
Mysterion	12	0	No, Stan, I'm being serious! I really, really can't die!	[]
Toolshed	2	0	...Woo-hat?	[]
Mysterion	30	1	Like last night, in the alley, the cult leader stabbed me and I bled all over the place! And you screamed Oh my God, and you called him a bastard!	['bastard']

Mysterion	13	1	All the time! I die all the time! And you assholes NEVER REMEMBER!	['assholes']

Mint-Berry Crunch	10	0	Nono. Mint-Berry Crunch doesn't ever pee his pants!	[]
Mysterion	11	0	I knew there'd be no point in telling you guys.	[]
Human Kite	35	0	Alright. dude, let, let's just say you're not crazy and it's true. What's the big deal? I mean, I think it'd be pretty cool not to be able to die.	[]
Mysterion	21	0	Pretty cool?! Do you know what it feels like to be stabbed?! To be shot?! Decapitated?! Torn apart?! Burned?! Run over?!	[]
Toolshed	4	0	Kenny Kenny, calm down.	[]
Mysterion	27	2	It's not pretty cool, Kyle! It fuckin' hurts! And it won't go away, and nobody will believe me!  Remember this time! Try and fuckin' remember!	['fuckin', 'fuckin']
Toolshed	6	1	Oh my God! Holy shit, dude!	['shit']
Human Kite	1	0	Dude!	[]
Mint-Berry Crunch	4	0	Is he? Oh Jesus!	[]
Toolshed	3	0	Kenny? No! No!	[]
Coon	216	2	Gather around, believers in good, and listen to the newest installment of The Coon. It all began when the BP Oil Company drilled into the ocean floor and ripped open a hole into another dimension. Seeing the disaster on Coon-Vision, the Coon immediately called together his trusty Coon Friends. As the Coon explained how the disaster could be stopped, something terrible happened. Without warning, the Coon friends changed. Their superpowers morphed somehow, turning them into... supervillains.  The Coon tried to reason with them, tried to bring them back to the side of good,  but it was too late.  Their black hearts had been tainted by hate and rage. The Coon was alone, turn by the ultimate dilemma.  He had to put a stop to the evil villains, even though they had once been his friends. Sometimes, to fight the ultimate evil, you must make friends with enemies.  The Coon teamed up with Cthulhu, because even Cthulhu knows what evil assholes Kyle and Stan and those guys are! And that they are manipulative, uncaring, vagina faces! They're all planning to destroy the world. Only one thing can stop them: the Coon. With Cthulhu's help, I can try to banish them to a dark oblivion, for all eternity.  I will not rest until that happens.	['assholes', 'vagina']

Liane	1	0	What?	[]

Human Kite	20	0	Cartman, if you team up with the most evil thing in the universe, then clearly you are the bad guy!	[]
Coon	16	0	No, because it's for the greater good, like when Superman teamed up with Lex Luthor!	[]
Human Kite	7	0	Superman never teamed up with Lex Luthor!	[]
Coon	36	0	Well, that's why Superman isn't around anymore, isn't it? Cthulhu! Banish them to a dark oblivion, please!  Aww! Dude, that was awesome! You're all like Mehhhh and they were all like Nooo!	[]
Coon	120	0	All right, now, we've taken out most of the synagogues, destroyed San Francisco, sent my friends into a dark oblivion, and so our next order of business will be Burning Man.  Burning Man is the biggest hippie festival in the world, and tomorrow, we're gonna wipe them all out. Pretty soon, the whole wold will be transformed thanks to the Coon!  Yes yes, the Coon and Friend. Now after Burning Man we'll take down Whole Foods alright?  The dark lord is agitated and the LeBron James technique might not work. The Coon will have to use an even more manipulative technique. Time to bust out: Cute Kitten.  Meow meow meow meow meow meow meow.  Meow meow meow.	[]
Toolshed	6	1	Dude, where the fuck are we?	['fuck']
Mysterion	13	0	I don't know, but... I feel like... I've... been here before.	[]
Mint-Berry Crunch	50	0	And so, the Coon had returned with the dark lord Cthulhu! Upon seeing Cthulhu in person, Mint-Berry Crunch heroically dashed off, to, to save the day!

A Voice	5	0	How to I fight him?	[]
Tall Goth	7	0	Oh joy, it's Underwear Boy again.	[]
Mysterion	11	0	That god you pray to just took away all my friends.	[]

Mint-Berry Crunch	29	0	How was it that mint and berry came together delivering full flavor in an intense crunch?  We must find out answers Mysterion.  Mu-Mysterion, I'm going with you.	[]
Coon	81	2	After the triumphant victory over the evil hippies of Burning Man, Coon and Friends turned their attention to the next villainous scourge, bravely taking out every Whole Foods left in the country! No more organic crap for America! Thanks to Coon and Friends the country would soon be rid of all evil, but first, they would come up against their most challenging and most evil opponent, Justin Bieber. In order to save the Earth, this little butthole had to be stopped.	['crap', 'butthole']

Coon	26	0	It isn't just Cthulhu, Mr. Reporter. He's merely a small piece of Coon and Friends, who will continue to fight for good and justice.	[]
Reporter 2	15	0	Good and justice? J-Justin Bieber and most of his fans have just been massacred.	[]
Coon	38	0	Yes, Coon and Friends are happy to help. We do not need thanks for our deeds. We do not want gifts, all we want is for people to buy our Coon and Friends T-Shirts for $14.95.	[]

Mysterion	7	2	Come back, you fat piece of shit!	['fat', 'shit']
Alien Man	113	0	Hello my son. If you are seeing this message, then it must be dark times. And you must have many questions. Your true name is Gok'Zarah. The power given to you comes from a planet far away. You are from that planet, Gok'Zarah. It is for that reason you have a power that normal humans do not have. I know you must sometimes see this power as a curse, but you were sent here to stop evil from taking over the Earth and now, that time has apparently come. You must now harness and focus your power, Gok'Zarah. The power of mint and berries yet with a tasty, satisfying crunch.	[]
Mint-Berry Crunch	6	0	...Uh yes. Yes, please go on.	[]
Alien Man	56	0	Your home planet, K'oh Kajan, is known throughout the universe for its berry mines. Berries that have the power to fuel nearly anything. Needless to say, when the mint hunters of Kogenrah got word of them, our fate was already sealed, Gok'Zarah. But our two worlds collided and soon, mint and berry were one.	[]
Mint-Berry Crunch	1	0	Wow!	[]
Alien Man	19	0	Your mother and I sent you as far away as we could. Use your power, son. Save Earth. Shablagoo!	[]
Mint-Berry Crunch	34	0	I will, father. No more running away for... Mint-Berry Crunch!  Hello, Cthulhu, I heard you haven't been berry nice!  Not enough, huh? Maybe the intense flavor of mint will freshen things up!	[]
Mint-Berry Crunch	71	1	I reached the Gulf of Mexico in no time, and with all my strength, I dragged Cthulhu back to the depths from whence he came! My trusty hero companions were there, still alive. I returned them to their world encased in a protective berry bubble. Then it's back down to fill up the hole created by the BP Oil Company, returning home only momentarily to flip off my fat sister.	['fat']
Toolshed	13	0	Dude, thanks for getting us out of that dark oblivion, Mint-Berry Crunch.	[]
Mint-Berry Crunch	18	0	Oh no, we worked as a team! All the Coon and Friends stopped the BP drilling spill crisis.	[]
Human Kite	10	0	And finally the evil Coon is right where he belongs.	[]
Coon	11	2	Come on you guys, this is fucking bullcrap! Let me out!	['fucking', 'bullcrap']
Human Kite	9	0	You're not going anywhere for a long time!	[]
Coon	19	1	This is inhumane! There's a big bucket with Butters' poop in here, and there's nothing to eat!	['poop']
Toolshed	6	1	Ya got poop, don't ya?	['poop']
Mint-Berry Crunch	21	0	Well, I'm off. There are still many more questions left unanswered. I need to know what happened to my parents.	[]
Human Kite	8	0	Well, come back and visit any time, dude.	[]
Mint-Berry Crunch	3	0	I will. Shaaablagoo!	[]
Coon	5	2	Fuckin' Mint-Berry fuckin' Crunch.	['fuckin', 'fuckin']
Toolshed	14	0	Wow, can you believe it Kenny? Bradley actually had superpowers. Isn't that cool?	[]
Mysterion	13	0	Yeah. I'm tired, guys. I think I'm gonna go to bed.	[]
Toolshed	6	1	Oh my God! Holy shit dude!	['shit']
Human Kite	3	0	Kenny? No! Nooo!	[]
Stuart	2	0	What? Whaaat?!	[]
Mrs. McCormick	4	0	It's happenin' again!	[]
Mrs. McCormick	10	0	We should have never gone to that stupid cult meetin'.	[]
