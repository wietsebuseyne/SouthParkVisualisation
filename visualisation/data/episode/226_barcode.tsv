Mitt	19	0	I know the people are going to say, oh you should only practice it this way or that way.	[]
Rick	11	0	I believe in capitalism too. I believe in capitalism for everybody.	[]
Newt	21	0	What he said, which I find mildly amazing, was that he thought I would have a hard time debating Barack Obama.	[]
Ron	31	0	We faced something much much greater after World War II.  We had ten million coming home at once. What did we do then? Some liberals said we need more work programs-	[]
Stan	6	0	Tango, Tango, I'm in position.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Copy, tango. Clear vantage point?	[]
Stan	10	0	It will have to do. We're not getting closer.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Alright, Butters. Bring it in.	[]
Butters	6	0	Equipment is flying in, ten seconds.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Copy that. 10 seconds, Cartman.	[]
Cartman	10	0	I can hear Kyle, just tell me when to go.	[]
Agent 1	5	0	We might have a problem.	[]
Agent 2	3	0	What's that?	[]
Agent 1	12	0	We just got word somebody might try to Faith Hill this event.	[]
Agent 2	13	0	Lock down the whole perimeter. Nobody is Faith Hilling, not on my watch!	[]
Stan	14	0	I think they're onto us guys. Let's do this.  I got it.	[]
Agent 3	6	0	Hey, somebody is under the stage.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Go Cartman!	[]
Butters	6	0	We got it. We got it!	[]
Stan	3	0	Go, go, go.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Hehe hehe, that was sweet you guys.	[]
Reporter	95	1	First, there was planking.  People taking pictures of themselves in a planked position and putting the photos on the Internet. Planking was soon replaced by owling.  And after the super bowl by bradying.  But the newest meme involves pulling the shirt out to look like boobs.  It's called Faith Hilling. And all around the world people are doing it.  Kids, adults, and even notable celebrities are getting into the act.  But as Faith Hilling is more and more popular, the question on everyone's mind, who will be the first to die doing it?	['boobs']
Lamont	28	0	I have been sent here because you children are playing with fire!  Faith Hilling is nothing more than an evolution of bradying. From football quarterback to football singer.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Oh, please. Bradying is to 2000 and lame.	[]
Lamont	47	0	I know you all think what you're doing is new and hip and cool. But the truth is memeing has been around a long time. We're gonna watch a film strip now, that's a little dated but I think it gets the point across.	[]
Speaker	28	0	For many young people today taking pictures in silly poses becomes a dangerous past time. The latest meme has also become the most deadly. It's called tebowing.	[]
Speaker	15	0	This is Ryan and Barkley. They're about to learn how dangerous tebowing can be.	[]
Ryan	11	0	Here is a good place. I'll do it right here.	[]
Barkley	12	0	I don't know, Ryan, you sure this is a good idea?	[]
Ryan	16	0	Stop being a scaredy-cat. It will just take a second, how could I get hurt?	[]
Barkley	6	0	Okay, hold still.  What's that?	[]
Ryan	3	0	A traaain! AAAAAA!	[]
Barkley	1	0	RYAN!	[]
Ryan	8	0	No, no! Nooo! No, no, no, no, noooo!	[]
Barkley	1	0	Ryan!	[]
Ryan	3	0	Learn from me.	[]
Woman 1	19	0	This sure is a nice car, Tommy.  Would you like to get a picture of me tebowing in it?	[]
Tommy	4	0	Sure.  What is that?	[]
Woman 1	6	0	Oh my God, it's coming!	[]
Tommy	4	0	God no!  No, no!	[]
Woman 1	7	0	Tommy, d-did you get the picture?	[]
Tommy	5	0	Hold on, wait, hold on!	[]
Woman 1	4	0	Hurry, hurry! AAAAA!  Eeeaaah!	[]
Man 1	5	0	Be careful up there, Pete.	[]
Pete	7	0	Just go on and take the picture.	[]
Speaker	101	2	These youths paid with their lives for tebowing. When they posed for pictures they should have remembered there are only three approved memes: peace signs , bunny ears  and fake wiener  Maybe you think this doesn't apply to you, maybe you think your memes are safe. Or maybe you're watching this in the future and tebowing has been replaced by some other meme. Well, if you are watching his in the future,  get off your flying cellphone scooters and THINK. Just remember.  Use the approved poses if you want to be a memer. Peace signs, bunny ears, and fake wieners.	['wiener', 'wieners']
Cartman	5	0	Oh, God. That was boring.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Totally!)	[]
Kyle	8	0	So, what do you want to do now?	[]
Cartman	17	0	Well, there is the nice French cafe downtown. Maybe we should get some Faith Hilling pictures there.	[]
Stan	6	0	Oh, that's a good idea.	[]
Butters	15	0	What?! You mean you guys still plan on Faith Hilling after what we just saw?	[]
Cartman	6	0	Butters, Faith Hilling defines our generation.	[]
Butters	4	0	Well, count me out.	[]
Kyle	15	0	You're gonna give up on Faith Hilling just like that, Butters? How could you?	[]
Butters	4	0	Well, I'm scared.	[]
Craig	7	0	Hey, did you see today's newspaper?	[]
Cartman	8	1	Why would we look at a newspaper, retard?	['retard']
Craig	6	0	You guys made the front page.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Really?	[]
Stan	7	0	Dude, we are on the front page!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Yes!	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Yeah, dude!)	[]
Stan	7	0	Can we get a different pose, please?	[]
Cartman	8	0	What's it say, what's it say?	[]
Stan	15	0	It says... Oh, oh no. It says Faith Hilling is now all like 2000-late.	[]
Cartman	5	0	What? Let me see that.	[]
Kyle	5	0	How can that be? Already?	[]
Stan	22	0	Public reaction was the stunt pulled off by five elementary school students was not only dangerous and disruptive but also completely passe.	[]
Kyle	11	0	How can we be passe? We're only in 4th grade.	[]
Stan	24	0	Faith Hilling is pretty stale, said Republican candidate Newt Gingrich. If they had crashed the debate by Taylor Swifting that would have been impressive.	[]
Cartman	7	1	Taylor Swifting? What the fuck is that?	['fuck']
Stan	5	0	That's all it is?	[]
Cartman	16	1	You pull down your pants and wipe your butt on the ground like an old dog.	['butt']
Kyle	17	0	But that's stupid.  How can that replace Faith Hilling? It doesn't even make any sense.	[]
Cartman	19	0	I can't believe people take the time to do this garbage.  This has to be stopped, you guys.	[]
Boy 1	11	0	Okay. Hold it there. Okay. That's good, don't move.	[]
Cartman	6	0	How is this Kyle? This good?	[]
Kyle	4	0	Yep, that's great.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Cool, these will be good uploads.	[]
Boy 2	5	0	Hey, what are you doing?	[]
Cartman	12	1	Faith Hilling. Why don't you get the fuck out of here?	['fuck']
Boy 1	8	0	Oh God. Faith Hilling is so February 2012.	[]
Stan	14	1	Saying something is so 2000 and anything is so 2009, you stupid ass wipe.	['ass']
Boy 2	19	0	Come on guys. It's not worth it. We can do our Taylor Swifting somewhere else.   Knock it off!	[]
Cartman	6	0	Why don't you make me?	[]
Lamont	72	0	Yesterday afternoon four kids went to the hospital for injuries resulting from memeing in front of a local cafe.  Faith Hilling, Taylor Swifting. These are things that will get you killed!  That's a loaded .38. How many of you think it's a smart idea to put a loaded .38 on a 9-year-old's desk? Well, if safety doesn't matter to you go ahead, pick the gun up.	[]
Butters	6	0	Oh, that's okay. I think...	[]
Lamont	24	0	Pick the gun up! You might as well. Swifting and hilling is like playing with a loaded gun! Do you all understand my point?	[]
Kids	2	0	Yes, sir.	[]
Lamont	8	0	Good. Now put the gun in your mouth.	[]
Butters	1	0	HA?!	[]
Lamont	42	0	Hey! You're following plankers and tebowers, so put a loaded gun in your mouth! DO IT!  Everybody take a good look.  This is what you're doing every time you play with Internet memes. You're playing roulette with your lives!	[]
Man 2	6	0	Professor Lamont, we need to talk.	[]
Lamont	5	0	I will be right back.	[]
Man 2	8	0	You're an expert on memes, Professor Lamont.	[]
Lamont	5	0	Yes, what is this about?	[]
Man 3	5	0	We need your expertise, sir.	[]
Man 2	11	0	Have you ever heard of another species, memeing on the Internet?	[]
Lamont	7	0	Another species? What are you talking about?	[]
Man 3	48	0	We were hoping perhaps you could help us understand...  this.  Cats have started to put pictures of themselves on the Internet, with bread around their heads. Cat breading, it's called. It's just such an odd thing to do, we thought would you explain it to us.	[]
Lamont	6	0	They're evolving. Cats are evolving.	[]
Man 3	1	0	Sorry?	[]
Lamont	22	0	There are two ways a species evolves. Physically from genes and culturally from memes. Just like genes, memes replicate, mutate and adapt.	[]
Man 2	9	0	We're having a hard time following you here.	[]
Lamont	57	1	Look. In the 70s there was fonzing.  Which replaced the outdated mustaching.  In the 60s cultural ideas were passed on by everybody poodle-fisting.  But even that evolved from people ass wedging in the 40s.  Even before photographs humans memed for portraits. All the way back to the Egyptians who had pictures painted of themselves donkey ticking.	['ass']
Man 2	14	0	You are saying cats are showing signs of evolution with their cat breading meme?	[]
Lamont	24	0	If they're putting slices of bread on their heads and taking pictures,  they're proving to be almost as intelligent as we are.	[]
Cartman	60	0	Mr. Kitty, do you mind explaining this?  You wanna tell me why you're putting pictures of yourself on the Internet with bread around your face? This is a bad kitty. Bad! You're taking the idea of Faith Hilling and making it stupid. Bad kitty.  Bad Mr. Kitty.  Bad kitty! No more memeing!  Come on, guys.  Bad Mr. Kitty!	[]
Stan	9	0	Well, I'm glad we took care of that.	[]
Kyle	8	0	Yeah, what do you guys wanna do now?	[]
Cartman	14	0	I was thinking of maybe Faith Hilling at the place they do AA meeting.	[]
Stan	5	0	That's a cool idea	[]
Kenny	4	1	(Oh, fuck it, dude.)	['fuck']
Kyle	6	0	W-what's the matter, Kenny?	[]
Kenny	8	0	(I don't know. That seems quite pointless.)	[]
Stan	3	0	What seems pointless?	[]
Kenny	9	0	(Hey, just accept Faith Hilling is out of style!)	[]
Kyle	9	0	Hey!  Faith Hilling is not out of style, alright?	[]
Kenny	9	0	(Well,... ...and I can't take any of that!)	[]
Stan	18	1	No, no, no! These stupid fads are only that, okay? We can't give in to this crap.	['crap']
Cartman	15	0	Don't give up on Faith Hilling, Kenny. Don't you give up on her.	[]
Reporter	51	0	Two Boulder children died today while Oh Long Johnsoning in a battling cage. Oh Long Johnsonning is of course the latest Internet meme which involves putting oneself in a risky situation and then seeing how many times you can say Oh Long Johnson on video before getting out of the way.	[]
Boy 3	4	0	You ready, you ready?	[]
Boy 4	4	0	I'm recording, go.	[]
Boy 3	9	0	Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson. O-Oh Long-	[]
Boy 4	1	0	Larry!	[]
Reporter	37	0	This latest Internet meme is shocking. But most shocking of all is the person who started the meme isn't a person at all, but a cat who seems to have no regard for people's safety.	[]
Cat	9	0	Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson.	[]
Reporter	17	0	The cat is now under arrest and awaiting trial for its part in the teenager's death.	[]
Stan	6	0	Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson.	[]
Boy 1	10	0	Yeah, that's good. Now go back the other way.	[]
Stan	5	0	Oh Long Johnson, Oh Long-	[]
Cartman	5	0	Dude, what's going on?	[]
Stan	7	0	Oh, hey, guys. How's it going?	[]
Kyle	16	0	We thought you were meeting us at Cartman's. What are you doing here, Taylor Swifting?	[]
Boy 1	9	0	He's not Taylor Swifting, that's old stuff.	[]
Stan	24	0	Yeah, now you're doing to see how many times you can say Oh Long Johnson. I thought just, you know, try it out.	[]
Cartman	19	0	Guys, remember when we heard about that pollack with one testicle in the revolutionary war? What was his name?	[]
Kyle	2	0	Benedict Arnold.	[]
Stan	26	0	Oh, come on. You guys need to realize that Faith Hilling is over, okay?  You can pretend all you want, but it's not coming back.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Kenny?	[]
Kenny	12	0	(I'm sorry guys. Faith Hilling is just a stupid fad, right?)	[]
Boy 1	20	0	If you guys wanna keep Faith Hilling, I'm sure people are still doing it at the old folks home.	[]
Stan	9	0	You will like this, Kenny. Pull down your pants.	[]
Kyle	4	0	You guys are sellouts.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Come on, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	4	0	You're freaking sellouts!	[]
Cartman	6	0	It's okay, man, come on.	[]
Lamont	24	1	What the hell do you think you're doing? Do you have any idea when you play with memes you're playing with fire?	['hell']
Cat	3	0	Oh Long Johnson.	[]
Lamont	13	0	Oh, very funny. People are dying out there. Is that what you want?	[]
Cat	3	0	Oh Long Jeeea-	[]
Lamont	14	0	You cats want a war? Because that's what you're going to get!	[]
Cat	3	0	Oh oh oh.	[]
Reporter 2	63	0	Long ago there was tebowing, which evolved into Faith Hilling. But the latest memeing craze, Swift-Johnsoning, may now also have its rival.  A brand new meme, where people video themselves wearing trench coats and talking about the dangers of memeing. They call it reporting. And safety officials say that it's dangerous and potentially fatal.  Oh! Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson.	[]
Kyle	16	1	Yeah, yeah, that's cool. Bring the left titty out some more.  Yeah, yeah freeze there.	['titty']
Little Boy	6	0	What are those boys doing, daddy?	[]
Dad	15	0	Oh, I think they're Faith Hilling, Bobby. It's a little before your time.	[]
Little Boy	2	0	How droll.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Get a couple facing the other way, brah.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Yeah, good idea.	[]
Doctor	28	0	Hey, you kids Faith Hilling in front of my clinic? 'Cause I got a couple of patients in here that could use a good time machine.  Get it?	[]
Man 4	6	1	Go back to the 90s! Faggooots!	['faggooots']
Kyle	6	0	We have to face it, Cartman.	[]
Cartman	5	0	I know. I know Kyle.	[]
Kyle	7	0	I really thought it was gonna last.	[]
Cartman	20	0	I guess the only thing that doesn't change in life... is that things change.  The sun hurts my eyes.	[]
Kyle	11	0	It wasn't like Faith Hilling was that great. I mean-	[]
Cartman	8	0	No, no. It was kind of stupid, really.	[]
Kyle	9	0	I-It's good that it became something else.	[]
Cartman	10	0	And we'll have a blast doing the new stuff.	[]
Reporter	40	0	Household cats have evolved into a species as intelligent as humans. Will this mean war between our two life forms? In an attempt to try and communicate with the leader of cats, experts have sent in the ambassador of people.	[]
Ambassador	1	0	Hello.	[]
Cat	3	0	Oh Long Johnson.	[]
Ambassador	2	0	Meow, meow.	[]
Cat	3	0	Oh Long Johnson.	[]
Ambassador	2	0	Long Johnson.	[]
Cat	3	0	Oh Long Johnson.	[]

Cat	4	0	Oh- Oh Don Piano.	[]
Ambassador	3	0	Oh Don Piano.	[]
Cat	3	0	Oh Long Johnson.	[]
Ambassador	3	0	Oh Don Piaaano.	[]
Cat	5	0	Oh Long Jon-Jon-Johnson.	[]
Ambassador	10	0	Oh lala lionde. Oh long John- Don piano. Don piaaaano.	[]
Cat	3	0	Oh Long Johnson.	[]
Ambassador	55	0	I'm not sure but I think it said war between our species is inevitable, that evolution cannot be stopped and cats will rise. It said we cannot coexist and then said oh don piaaano and then and then something about seeing the streets of human cities running red with the blood of their children.	[]
Stan	7	0	Okay, that's good, a little higher.	[]
Cartman	12	0	Okay, cool. I'm gonna go left to right, is that good?	[]
Kyle	4	0	Yeah, that's awesome.	[]
Stan	5	0	OK, whenever you're ready.	[]
Mr. Kitty	1	0	Meow.	[]
Cartman	7	0	No, kitty, you have to be quiet.	[]
Mr. Kitty	1	0	Meow.	[]
Cartman	7	0	No kitty! That's a bad kitty!	[]
Boy 1	4	0	Wow, what's this?	[]
Kyle	16	0	What, you been living under a rock? This is the new meme, Cat Taylor Swift Reporting.	[]
Stan	3	0	Alright, go Cartman.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Taylor Swift is dangerous. Taylor Swift is dangerous!	[]
Girl 1	4	0	That's pretty cool.	[]
Stan	7	0	Yeah, that's cool. It's awesome.	[]
Kyle	4	0	It's super awesome.	[]
Cartman	16	0	Yeah, yeah, we got it down, you guys. Think we're ready for the big time.	[]
Mr. Kitty	2	0	Meow, meow.	[]
Cartman	3	0	SHUT UP, KITTY!	[]
Reporter 3	45	0	With the inevitable species war looming, our country's brightest leaders have come together to debate and reason with the ambassador of cats. It's called putty-whistling. And the question on everyone's mind... Who will be the first person to die from it?	[]
Mitt	23	0	W-well, you know, I ran for president four years ago. This was the position I described when I ran four years ago...	[]
Rick	14	0	If you wanna be an American the first thing you should do is respect-	[]
Newt	18	0	To ask a very simple question. How big of a scale of change do we want in Washington.	[]
Cat	3	0	Oh Long Johnson.	[]
Newt	9	0	I started working in the governor wing in 1974.	[]
Cat	9	0	Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Piaano.	[]
Newt	6	0	I'm gonna say two things...	[]
Cat	3	0	Oh Long Johnson.	[]
Mitt	19	0	I have five sons, five daughters in law, sixteen grand kids, and they're the joy of my life.	[]
Cat	2	0	Oh Lalalonde.	[]
Newt	15	0	I was wrong when I figured it out. You were wrong when you didn't.	[]
Cat	3	0	Oh Long Johnson.	[]
Rick	29	0	It's, It's not the most attractive thing to go out there and say, look it took me ten or twelve years to figure out it was wrong-	[]
Stan	7	0	Fox trot standing by at position alpha.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Copy, Fox trot, let's fly in the goods Tango.	[]
Kenny	7	0	(This is Tango. I have the goods.)	[]
Stan	5	0	Standing by in three seconds.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Two, one. Go Cartman!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Let's do this.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Cartman? Go, Cartman.	[]
Stan	4	0	Come on, dude. Hurry.	[]
Cartman	46	1	No. NOO!  I won't do it. I won't do it, you hear me! I'm better than this.  And to hell with you, Mr. Kitty. You're a bad kitty! Bad, bad kitty! It's time somebody stood up, and did the right thing.	['hell']
Kyle	4	0	Yeah. Do it, Cartman.	[]
Cartman	16	1	Alright, football night, what do you do? Get out your camera and a boobie or two.	['boobie']
Stan	1	0	Wow!	[]
Cartman	10	0	We gotta get serious while we're in our prime.	[]
Man 5	8	0	Have you ever seen Faith Hilling so good?	[]
Cartman	24	1	Come on everybody, It's Faith Hilling time. Dancin', rappin', titties flappin' where are you? This is the only memeing I'll ever do.	['titties']
Cat	3	0	Oh Long Johnson.	[]
Cartman	17	0	Is a meme I will fight 'Cause I'm Faith Hilling 'til the day that I die.	[]
Reporter 3	60	1	And so in the face of war a little boy reminds us all what being human really means. The message is unclear. But it doesn't matter as long as you give the audience a song, celebrity bashing, and Republican hopefuls dancing around with boobies. It's called pandering and all over the country people are-  Oh! Oh Long Johns-	['boobies']
