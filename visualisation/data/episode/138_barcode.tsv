Cartman	8	0	Haha! I'm totally wet! This is awesome!!	[]
Announcer	71	0	How about that, folks! A full body flip! And now, Kelly's gonna show us how she makes Jambu do his tricks.  When Kelly slaps her hand three times, Jambu comes to her. Jambu will stay and wait until Kelly gives him a command.  Oh, what trick are we gonna see? Get those cameras ready!  That's Kelly riding on Jambu's nose!  I wish Kelly would ride on my nose.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Yes! Yeehehehes!	[]
Announcer	24	1	We hope you enjoyed Jambu's orca show, and enjoy the rest of your day at Denver's Sea Park!  You bunch of retards.	['retards']
Stan	4	0	Okay, where to next?	[]
Cartman	11	0	I think there's a sea lion show at 2:30.	[]
Kyle	13	0	Let's just stay here and watch the whale swim around some more.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Why?	[]
Kyle	16	0	Dude, everyone's leaving! We can walk right up to the tank and really study him.	[]
Cartman	17	0	Kyle, the show is over! The whale isn't gonna splash us any more, so who cares?	[]
Stan	16	0	Let's go see the stingrays, and then we can go to the sea lion show.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Killer.	[]
Kyle	19	0	I'll meet up with you guys in a little bit. I-I wanna hang out here some more.	[]
Cartman	22	0	Okay, Kyle. We're gonna get splashed some more, but if you wanna go make love to the whale, that's fine.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Jambu? Jambu?  Cool! It worked! Hey, Jambu.	[]
Jambu	7	0	Hello, little boy.  You like my flippers?	[]
Kyle	3	0	Who said that?	[]
Jambu	2	0	I did.	[]
Kyle	2	0	No way!	[]
Jambu	16	0	This is very exciting! Usually when I talk, nobody can hear me. Where are you from?	[]
Kyle	2	0	South Park.	[]
Jambu	16	0	It sure is nice to have somebody to talk to. Can't we talk more? Please?	[]
Kyle	6	0	What do you wanna talk about?	[]
Jambu	6	0	Let's talk about rocket ships.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Rocket ships?	[]
Jambu	33	0	Yeah. I love rockets, but I can't see them 'cause I'm stuck in this tank. . You know, someday, I wish that I could go up in space in a rocket ship.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Why? Aren't you happy here?	[]
Jambu	18	0	I try to be, but my wish is to one day blast off in a big rocket ship!	[]
Kyle	16	0	This is amazing! But wait right here. I've gotta go tell my friends about this!	[]
Jambu	8	0	Oh God, it's funny every single time.	[]
Stingray Announcer	40	0	And for those of you just joining us, this is the stingray tank. Stingrays are members of the shark family, but they're extremely peaceful creatures. We invite you to gently touch the top of them as they swim by.	[]
Cartman	18	0	Heh! Come on, stingray!  Splash me! Ha! Hey, splash me!  Dude, these things are dumb. Let's go!	[]
Kyle	10	0	Hey you guys! You guys are not gonna believe this!	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Kyle	7	0	Dude, he talks! The orca whale talks!	[]
Kenny	7	1	(What the fuck are you talking about?)	['fuck']
Kyle	34	0	I went up to Jambu's tank and I tapped three times like the trainer did. Jambu swam up and started talking to me about rocket ships! Come on! You gotta check it out!	[]
Kyle	25	0	Jambu! Jambu, I'm back!  How are you feeling?  Huhm. Jambu, you wanna talk about rocket ships?  Ja- Jambu? Are you still feelin' lonely here?	[]
Cartman	6	0	Kyle, Kyle. Let it go, man.	[]
Kyle	13	0	He talked! I swear to Abraham he talked, and he loves rocket ships!	[]
Partner	7	0	Dude, he's back, he's back!	[]
Kyle	3	1	Goddammit, say something!	['goddammit']
Cartman	11	0	Come on, guys, let's leave Kyle with his stupid whale.	[]
Jambu	6	0	Please don't call me stupid.	[]
Kyle	9	0	Jambu! Jambu, why didn't you speak up before?	[]
Jambu	18	0	I'm sorry. Sometimes I can't talk. It's because I'm very very sick, you see.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Sick?	[]
Stan	5	0	I don't believe it.	[]
Jambu	24	0	Yes, because I'm not used to the earth atmosphere. You see, my name is actually Willzy-x, and I'm from the moon!	[]
Partner	2	0	The moon?	[]
Jambu	23	0	The... that's where all orca whales are from. If I don't get back to the moon, I'm going to die.	[]
Cartman	5	0	You live on the moon?	[]
Jambu	21	0	I used to. I wish I could return and dance in the moon castle with my wife and three children again.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Oh my God...	[]
Stan	13	0	Why don't you just tell the people here at the sea park?	[]
Jambu	33	0	I can't tell them, because they're evil communists from the Horsehead Nebula. They want to kill all us zypods, so they keep us in these horrible tanks and make us perform.	[]
Kyle	3	0	That's terrible!	[]
Partner	6	0	Dude, dude, the boss is coming!	[]
Jambu	18	0	Uh, uh, sorry boys, I can't talk anymore. I'm too sick.  Can't. Talk. Any. More.	[]
Kyle	29	0	Alright guys, listen up! This may sound a little strange, but, the whale, at the Denver Sea Park, is going to die, unless we get it to the moon,	[]
Butters	6	0	Well okay! Let's do it!	[]
Kyle	37	0	The whale's name is Willzy-x, and he told us he's dying on our planet. We've come up wth a plan, but we're gonna need all of your help to make it work.	[]
Clyde	5	0	...A whale. Talked to you.	[]
Stan	17	0	It's true. The whale talked to all of us. In between shows at his orca tank.	[]
Craig	22	0	Hey, that whale talked to me too. After everyone left the show I walked up to the glass and he started talking.	[]
Kyle	8	0	Weh-well, why didn't you tell anybody?	[]
Craig	23	0	Well I thought I was crazy. He said my dad was gonna sneak into my room naked one night and beat me up.	[]
Kyle	20	0	Well you're NOT crazy. The whale talked to all of us. And he needs our help getting him home.	[]
Craig	4	0	...So it's true.	[]
Kyle	24	0	Nobody else is going to help him, you guys. We've got a chance to do something pretty special here. Are you with us?	[]
Token	4	0	...What do we do?	[]
Kyle	1	0	Stan?	[]
Stan	32	0	All right. In order to make our plan work, we're going to need the pool from Clyde's back yard, Timmy's wheelchair, the Russian government, and all of our skateboards.	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmihhhhh...	[]
Stan	6	0	Craig, Token, get the slings ready.	[]
Kyle	15	0	Shhh. Willzy-x, don't say anything. We're gonna bust you out of here.	[]
Announcer	21	1	Dude, did you see that episode of Trading Spouses last night? That was insane. Yeah, well ha- whoa. What the hell?	['hell']
Owner	15	0	How could you not have seen anything?? It's a whale, for Christ's sake!	[]
Guard	12	0	It must have been taken while I was going to the bathroom.	[]
Owner	7	0	Were you in there for three hours?!	[]
Guard	5	0	Don't yell at me!	[]
Announcer	2	0	What happened?	[]
Kelly	10	0	Somebody kidnapped Jambu, took him right out of the park.	[]
Partner	2	0	What? How?	[]
Guard	4	0	I DON'T KNOW!	[]
Sergeant	24	1	All right, people, it's obvious we're dealing with a highly intelligent animal-rights group. Those bastards have done stuff like this before.	['bastards']
Nelson	7	0	Sir! Sir, we've found a note!	[]
Owner	25	1	A note? Let me see that.  We're taking Willzy-x home to the moon. Long live the zypods!  What the hell does that mean?	['hell']
Sergeant	27	0	Harris, run a fingerprint on that note!  Nelson! Find out what kind of crayon it was written with.  We'll find out who was responsible for this!	[]
Partner	12	0	We have to tell them! We know what those boys look like!	[]
Announcer	17	0	We can't tell them, then they're, they're gonna think this is all our fault	[]
Partner	5	0	It IS all our fault!	[]
Announcer	13	0	How were we supposed to know that they were gonna actually do it?!	[]
Partner	24	0	I shouldn't have laughed. All those times we've messed with those kids' heads, I shouldn't have just sat there and laughed.	[]
Announcer	23	0	Don't you say that! It was funny! It was really funny! We've just...  we've just gotta make this right ourselves.	[]
Partner	1	0	How?	[]
Announcer	11	0	We've gotta track down those kids. Before the police do!	[]
Putin	24	0	Comrades, I'm afraid our situation is dire. The economy is stale and I... Very soon, Mother Russia... will no longer be a country.	[]
Aide	14	0	Sir! Sir, somebody is on telephone! Another rich American wants to fly into space!	[]
Putin	6	0	Hello? Hello, this is Russian President.	[]
Kyle	17	0	Hi. My name's Kyle. Uh, I understand that your country flies people into space for money.	[]
Putin	9	0	Yes, we certainly do!  What were you looking for?	[]
Kyle	12	0	I need to book one trip to the moon, please. Right away.	[]
Putin	15	0	The moon. That is quite large trip, but I'm sure we can do it!	[]
Kyle	3	0	You can? Awesome!	[]
Putin	15	0	It sounds like we're in business! We will just need, say, twenty million dollars?	[]
Kyle	13	1	Twenty... million?  Are you nuts? We don't have that kind of money.	['nuts']
Putin	1	0	...What?	[]
Kyle	21	0	But you need to understand: we have a whale here that needs to get back to his family on the moon.	[]
Putin	15	2	Goddamnit it is prank call again!  Kiss my ass, George Bush! This is not funny!	['goddamnit', 'ass']
Stan	2	0	What happened?	[]
Kyle	5	0	They want twenty million dollars.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Twenty million? Just to go to the dumb moon?	[]
Craig	18	0	That was it? That was you guys' whole plan? Ask the Russians to take the whale to space?	[]
Stan	11	0	They were going to do it for that 'N Sync guy.	[]
Tweek	8	0	Oh, Jesus, now what are we gonna do?!	[]
Kyle	26	0	All right, look, there's gotta be other Third-World countries with space programs. We've gotta split up and find someplace cheaper, that's all.	[]
Clyde	15	0	Well we can't keep the whale out here anymore, people are gonna see it!	[]
Anchor Tom	32	0	A beloved performing orca whale has been stolen from the Denver Sea Park. A full investigation is underway, but tracking down the kidnappers is proving to be one WHALE of a problem.	[]
Field Reporter	28	0	Thanks, Tom, I'm here at the Denver Sea Park where, believe it or not, dozens of people have come to show support for whoever took the whale.	[]
ALF Leader	33	0	That's right. We are members of the Animal Liberation Front! Whales do not belong in tanks, they belong in the ocean! We applaud whoever did this noble deed! Set the whales free!	[]
Protesters	4	0	Set the whales free!	[]
Field Reporter	14	0	One thing for certain: something is certainly FISHY here at the Sea Park. Tom?	[]
Anchor Tom	19	0	Thank, Mitch. It seems that this problem is almost un-BEAR-able.  Let's hope that whale is found.	[]
Partner	18	0	This is so bad, man. How do we even know this is the right town to look in??	[]
Announcer	27	0	Will you relax? Those kids said they were from South Park. We've just gotta go door to door. Do you have the composite sketch we did?	[]
Partner	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Announcer	3	0	Let's go!	[]
Partner	16	0	Maybe you should start with the houses on the left, a-and I'll take the-	[]
Announcer	12	0	Wait a minute. Check that out!  Come on!  Oh my good, look!	[]
Partner	2	1	Whale poo.	['poo']
Announcer	7	0	We're close. We're really close!	[]
Mrs. Donovan	4	0	Can I help you?	[]
Announcer	13	0	Oh... h-hello ma'am. We're just here to examine your pool.	[]
Mrs. Donovan	1	0	Oh.	[]
Partner	10	0	Have you noticed any whales in your pool at all?	[]
Mrs. Donovan	34	0	No, I don't believe so. But we've been out of town for a couple of days and came back to find the fence broken. Do you think somebody's been using it?	[]
Announcer	9	0	Ma'am, do you recognize any of these boys?	[]
Mrs. Donovan	22	1	The fat one in the middle... kinda looks like Dakota Fanning. Excuse me, gentlemen, I have to get back to the oven.	['fat']
Partner	11	0	We're too late. They've moved on to another town!	[]
Announcer	5	0	We don't know that!	[]
Partner	37	0	If they've moved on, then we have no leads! This is fate, Brian! It's fate! For telling the kids their naked dads were gonna beat them up! For thinking that screwing with kids was funny!	[]
Announcer	47	0	It WAS funny!! It was funny, Bob! And it will be funny again, I swear to you! If those boys took the whale out of here, we would have seen them on the road! I'm telling you, we're close. It's going to be funny!	[]
Sheila	15	0	Kyle bubbe, we're taking Ike to the new Harry Potter movie. Wanna join us?	[]
Kyle	11	0	I can't, Mom. We're working on our school project.	[]
Sheila	16	0	All right. Well, there's pizza in the fridge if you and your friends get hungry.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Okay ma, thanks!	[]
Butters	9	0	Shouldn't we get him back in the water?	[]
Clyde	12	1	Whales are mammals; they don't need water to breathe, dumb-ass.	['ass']
Cartman	8	0	Yeah, we just have to keep him wet.	[]
Kyle	57	0	Yes, yes, hello? Is this Mr. Su-gi-yama with the Japanese space program?  How much to take a whale into space?  Nu-no, we don't want you to eat the whale, we want you to send it to the moon. How much? Jesus Christ! Uh hang on.  Hello? Jimmy, any luck at the Chinese Embassy?	[]
Jimmy	14	0	The Ch-Chinese will take someone to space for t-t-ten million dollars.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Ten million?? Well that's more than the Germans want!	[]
Jimmy	15	1	Yeah. We told them that, a-and they told us to go f-fuck ourselves.	['fuck']
Kyle	14	1	Damnit!  Tell me what to do, Willzy-x! How do we get you home??	['damnit']
Cartman	11	0	He hasn't said a word since we brought him here.	[]
Kyle	27	0	Yeah... He must be really sick.  Hang on Willzy-x. There's still hope. Stan and Craig might still luck with the space program down in Mexico.	[]
Clyde	5	0	Mexico has a space program?	[]
Stan	13	0	Uh, 'xcuse me, we're looking for the Mexican... Aeronautica y Spacia Administrashown?	[]

Stan	3	0	Two hundred? Million?	[]
Man 2	3	0	Two hundred... dollars.	[]
Stan	3	0	Quick, call Kyle.	[]
Announcer	19	0	Eh hello ma'am, uh, the teacher at the school said she recognized this boy to be your son?	[]
Sheila	12	0	Oh yes, that's my bubbe. Kind of a bad drawing though.	[]
Announcer	14	0	Ma'am, we need to talk to your son, please! It's very urgent!	[]
Sheila	13	0	I'm sorry, he just left. He's on his way to Mexico.	[]
Both men	1	0	Mexico??	[]

ALF Leader	13	0	I'm afraid you're too late! The whale's been set free.	[]
Owner	1	0	No!	[]
ALF Leader	53	0	Now you see that your ways of captivity and exploiting animals will never prevail.  Not as long as there are children like these who still believe in the beauty and magic of freedom.  For it is children, with their innocence and their spirit, who know what is truly best for all the world.	[]
ALF Leader	3	0	Oh my God!	[]
Kyle	3	0	We did it!	[]
Stan	5	0	Thanks for the ride, Manuel.	[]

Clyde	3	0	Yeah, me too.	[]
Kyle	23	0	All right. Thanks for your help, dudes.  Well, we did it, guys. It wasn't easy, but... we did a really amazing thing.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Yeah, I feel pretty awesome right now.	[]
Stan	11	0	I wonder... if he'll ever come back and visit us.	[]
Kyle	34	0	I don't know, but at least from now on, every time we look at the moon, we can know that Willzy-x is up there, dancing with the other zypods in his castle.	[]
