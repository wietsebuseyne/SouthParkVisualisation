Mr. Garrison	5	0	Eric, is there a problem?	[]
Cartman	12	0	Yeah, I can't get this stupid song out of my head.	[]
Mr. Garrison	5	2	Stinky Britches by Alanis Morissette?	['stinky', 'britches']
Cartman	4	3	Yeah. Stinky, stinky britches	['stinky', 'stinky', 'britches']
Mr. Garrison	8	0	Children, did you say hi to Mr. Twig?	[]
Mr. Twig	5	0	Hi, boys. How are you?	[]
Kyle	6	0	When is Mr. Hat coming back?	[]
Mr. Garrison	10	0	I told you never say his name in my presence.	[]
Stan	8	0	But we hate Mr. Twig. Mr. Twig sucks.	[]
Kid	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Cartman	5	3	Stinky britches, you got stinky--	['stinky', 'britches', 'stinky']
Mr. Garrison	24	0	It just so happens that Mr. Twig is far more stable than Mr. Hat could ever be, so he's the better puppet now--	[]
Kyle	9	0	He'd be better used as a coat rack.	[]
Mr. Garrison	7	0	How dare you! Come on, Mr. Twig.	[]
Chef	3	0	Hello there, children.	[]
Boys	2	0	Hey, Chef.	[]
Cartman	5	3	You got stinky britches, stinky--	['stinky', 'britches', 'stinky']
Chef	4	0	What did you say?	[]
Kyle	6	0	He singing some new hit song.	[]
Chef	7	0	Eric, where did you hear that song?	[]
Cartman	11	0	It's all over the place. On the radio, MTV, everywhere.	[]
Chef	7	0	Well, I'll be sodomized on Christmas.	[]
Stan	2	0	What, dude?	[]
Chef	8	0	Children, I wrote that song 20 years ago.	[]
Cartman	3	0	You wrote it?	[]
Chef	26	0	Yeah. Back when I used to be in the rock business. And now it looks like some big record company has published one of my songs.	[]
Kyle	8	0	Wow, then you should get money for it!	[]
Chef	20	0	Aww, I don't want any money. I just like to see my name on the credits, that's all.	[]
Kyle	23	0	Then we should go to the record company. My dad's a lawyer, dude; he tells me about this stuff all the time.	[]
Chef	16	0	Well, all right. Maybe I will go. I'll play them my version of the song.	[]
Chef (recording)	7	4	Stinky britches, you got those stinky britches.	['stinky', 'britches', 'stinky', 'britches']
Chef	16	2	So you see, Mr. Big Record Producer,  Stinky Britches was something I wrote several years ago.	['stinky', 'britches']
Producer	17	2	Hmm... I really so no resemblance between that song and Stinky Britches by our artist, Alanis Morissette.	['stinky', 'britches']
Chef	1	0	Huh?	[]
Kyle	6	1	It's the same goddamn song!	['goddamn']
Chef	25	0	Now, look, I'm trying to be cool about this, but you just can't rip people's music off! It's against the law!	[]
Producer	21	0	I am above the law!  Mr. Chef, I'm afraid you leave me no alternative. We're going to sue you.	[]
Chef	14	0	Sue me?! You stole one of my songs, and you're gonna sue me?	[]
Producer	17	0	Yes. I suggest you get a real good lawyer. We'll have the best in the business.	[]
Kyle	10	0	We'll get my dad to be Chef's lawyer!	[]
Cartman	5	1	Yeah, and he's Jewish.	['jewish']
Alanis Morissette	5	5	Stinky, stinky britches, stinky britches	['stinky', 'stinky', 'britches', 'stinky', 'britches']
Mr. Garrison	20	0	Mr. Twig, is that you?  Mis-Mr. Twig?  Aagghh!! Mr. Twig! No!  Who did this to you, Mr. Twig?! Who?!	[]
Gerald	16	1	Now, just let me do all the talking, Chef. We're gonna bring these bastards down.	['bastards']
Chef	1	0	Right.	[]
Judge Moses	11	0	This court is now in session. Who's representing the defense?	[]
Gerald	6	0	I am, Your Honor. Gerald Broflovski.	[]
Judge Moses	4	0	And representing the prosecution?	[]
Prosecutor	6	0	I am, Your Honor. Johnnie Cochran.	[]
Gerald	2	0	Uh-oh.	[]
Chef	3	0	Why uh-oh?	[]
Gerald	14	0	Chef, that's Johnnie Cochran. He's the guy who knocked O. J. off.	[]
Chef	2	0	Uh-oh.	[]
Mr. Garrison	16	0	I need some help over here! Please help! I think he's got third-degree burns!	[]
Dr. Doctor	5	0	Give the child to me.	[]
Mr. Garrison	8	0	Is he going to be all right, doctor?	[]
Dr. Doctor	1	0	Uhhh...	[]
Mr. Garrison	5	0	Is he going to live?	[]
Dr. Doctor	4	0	It's a stick.	[]
Mr. Garrison	18	1	Dammit, don't give me that medical jargon! Just tell me straight, is he going to be okay?!	['dammit']
Reporter	38	0	And so on this 15th day of what is considered to be the most important trial of the...day, Johnnie Cochran has appeared to defend Capitalist Records. The question now is, will Cochran use his famous Chewbacca defense?	[]
Cartman	5	0	What's a Chewbacca defense?	[]
Kyle	4	0	I don't know.	[]
Stan	11	0	That's what Cochran used in the O. J. Simpson trial.	[]
Cartman	37	3	Goddamn,  I hate that Cochran guy! If he was in front of me, I'd be like, Hey! You stupid son of a bitch! You-- How... How'd you like me to kick you in the nuts?!	['goddamn', 'bitch', 'nuts']
Kyle	12	1	I'm sure that would scare the hell out of him, Cartman.	['hell']
Gerald	62	0	And so, in summation, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you've heard the version of my client's song recorded over twenty years ago. You've heard the exact same song produced by those cheats in the past month. I'd say it's pretty much an open-and-shut case. Make the right decision. Thank you.  We've got 'em.	[]
Judge Moses	6	0	Mr. Johnnie Cochran, your closing arguments.	[]
Cochran	85	3	Ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury, Chef's attorney would certainly want you to believe that his client wrote Stinky Britches ten years ago. And they make a good case. Hell, I almost felt pity myself. But ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury, I have one, final, thing I want you to consider.  Ladies and gentleman, this is Chewbacca.  Chewbacca is a Wookie from the planet Kashyyyk. But Chewbacca lives on the planet Endor. Now think about that. That does not make sense.	['stinky', 'britches', 'hell']
Gerald	1	1	Dammit..!	['dammit']
Chef	1	0	What?	[]
Gerald	6	0	He's using the Chewbacca defense.	[]
Cochran	144	0	Why would a Wookiee, an 8-foot-tall Wookiee, want to live on Endor with a bunch of 2-foot-tall Ewoks? That does not make sense! But more important, you have to ask yourself: What does this have to do with this case? Nothing.  Ladies and gentlemen, it has nothing to do with this case! It does not make sense! Look at me, I'm a lawyer defending a major record company, and I'm talkin' about Chewbacca. Does that make sense? Ladies and gentlemen, I am not making any sense! None of this makes sense! And so you have to remember, when you're in that jury room deliberating and conjugating the Emancipation Proclamation... does it make sense? No! Ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury, it does not make sense! If Chewbacca lives on Endor, you must acquit! The defense rests.	[]
Judge Moses	3	0	O-kay, then.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Wow, he's good.	[]
Reporter	33	0	In a teary-eyed courtroom, Johnnie Cochran has just finished his closing arguments, and, as anticipated, he did use the Chewbacca defense.  Whether or it worked... is up to the jury to decide.	[]
Judge Moses	6	0	How find you find the jury?	[]
Foreman	10	0	We find the defendant, Jerome Chef McElroy... guilty as charged.	[]
Gerald	1	0	Whoops.	[]
Chef	1	0	Whoops?!	[]
Judge Moses	26	0	Mr. Chef, you have been found guilty of harassing a major company label. The full fee of $2 million will be handed over within 24 hours.	[]
Chef	8	0	Do I look like I have $2 million?	[]
Judge Moses	20	0	Well, you have 24 hours to find it, or else you have to go to jail. For eight million years.	[]
Bailiff	7	0	Uh, it's actually for four years.	[]
Judge Moses	10	0	Oh, sorry. You'll got to jail for four years.	[]
Chef	5	0	This can't be happening..!	[]
Stan	9	0	Oh, no, dude. Chef's gonna go to jail.	[]
Producer	8	0	And that chair, too. I want that chair.	[]
Chef	6	0	Hey, that's my favorite chair!	[]
Producer	26	0	You heard the judge. Since you lost the case, I can seize whatever I want to pay my legal fees. Yeah, take that water cooler, too.	[]
Stan	3	0	Hello there, Chef.	[]
Chef	2	0	Hey, children.	[]
Kyle	4	0	What's going on?	[]
Chef	25	0	Children, that record company guy is takin' all my belongings. And if I don't come up with $2 million, I'm going to jail.	[]
Stan	11	0	Well, don't worry. We came over to cheer you up.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Yeah. Ready, Cartman?	[]
Cartman	43	1	Ready. I will do the German dance for youIt's fun and gay and tra-la-laI hope my will enjoy my danceFiddle-e-aye, fiddle-e-aye ayWould you like some sauerkraut, German boy, German boy?Yes, I'd like some sauerkraut--	['gay']
Chef	11	0	Okay, okay, children, thank you very much. I feel much better.	[]
Stan	2	0	You do?	[]
Chef	4	0	Sure. Just please stop.	[]
Cartman	8	0	See? I told you guys it would work.	[]
Kyle	4	0	What's that, dude?	[]
Chef	14	0	This? This is my photo album of all my times in the rock business.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Did you ever know any famous people?	[]
Chef	28	0	Did I? Janis Joplin, The Beatles, Elton John... I got to travel all around the world, hanging out with bands, going to lavish parties, lovin' many, many women.	[]
Cartman	3	0	What's that?	[]
Chef	2	0	Nothing.  Anyway--	[]
Producer	3	0	Take this, too.	[]
Chef	14	1	Hey! That has no monetary value! What the hell are you taking that for?!	['hell']
Producer	6	0	I can take whatever I want.	[]
Chef	15	0	But I have 24 hours to come up with your money! That's the law!	[]
Producer	13	0	I am above the law!  I told you not to mess with me.	[]
Chef	43	0	That does it. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna raise that $2 million, but I'm not going to use it to pay you back. I'm going to use it to hire Johnnie Cochran myself and sue you!	[]
Producer	3	0	You wouldn't.	[]
Chef	10	0	Watch me. Now get the fudge out of my house!	[]
Mr. Garrison	63	1	I brought you some more juice, Mr. Twig. Are you feeling any better?  I don't know who would want to hurt you like this, but I promise nobody will ever hurt you again, ever.  Mist-Mr. Twig... are you okay? Mist-Mr. Twig..?  Aaaggghhh!! Mr. Twig is broken in half! Who did this?!  You won't get away with this, you bastards!	['bastards']
Chef	21	0	Okay. Thank you, Mr. Cochran.  Well, Johnnie Cochran will take my case if I can pay his legal fee, $2 million.	[]
Stan	19	0	Hey, why don't you ask all those famous people you used to know for money? They're rich.	[]
Chef	13	0	Oh, they wouldn't remember me. All I did was cook for them.	[]
Kyle	10	0	You can raise $2 million, dude. We'll help you.	[]
Chef	31	1	I appreciate that, children,  but raising $2 million is not an easy thing to do.  My only hope is to whore myself to every woman in town.  Wish me luck, children.	['whore']
Stan	6	0	We've gotta help him, dude.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Yeah, b-but how?	[]
Stan	16	0	Come on. Maybe those rock stars will remember Chef. Let's go pay them a visit!	[]
Kyle	6	0	Whoa, dude, this house is huge.	[]
Stan	8	1	Yeah, it's bigger than Cartman's ass.	['ass']
Cartman	6	0	No, it isn't, you guys.	[]
Butler	4	0	Can I help you?	[]
Cartman	20	0	We're trying to raise money for our friend, Chef.  Would you like a Moon Crunchie or a Snacky Cake?	[]
Kyle	4	0	Are you Elton John?	[]
Bulter	7	0	No, I'm one of his butlers.	[]
Kyle	19	1	Oh. Then what the hell are we talking to you for? Come on, guys.  Hi, are you Elton John?	['hell']
Elton	8	0	Sir Elton John. I was knighted, you know.	[]
Kyle	10	0	We're trying to raise money for our school chef.	[]
Cartman	8	0	We have Chocolate Nuggies and S'more Crunchies...	[]
Elton	12	0	I'm sorry, but I'm not a big candy bar fan.	[]
Cartman	1	0	What?!	[]
Stan	12	0	Could you just buy a couple anyway? Our friend Chef is really--	[]
Elton	5	0	Chef? You mean Chef-Chef?	[]
Kyle	2	0	Yeah, dude.	[]
Stan	4	0	Wow, you remember him?	[]
Elton	23	0	Of course. I haven't seen him for so long. I remember when I first met him. It was about 25 years ago.	[]
Elton	11	0	I was a struggling musician who couldn't get a break.	[]
Elton	25	0	Oh, oh, you're my cheddar cheese girlYou're soft but firm, and you go well with wineOh oh, cheddar cheese girlCheddar, cheddar cheese girl	[]
Man	1	0	Boo!	[]
Chef	19	0	Hey, Elton, don't feel so down, baby. Have some of my Scottish haggis. It'll cheer you up.	[]
Elton	12	0	Thanks, Chef. I just don't understand what my music is missing.	[]
Chef	15	1	Look, Elton, you are a great singer, but a retarded monkey could write better lyrics.	['retarded']
Elton	12	0	I really thought I had it this time with Cheddar Cheese Girl.	[]
Chef	34	0	What you need is a guy to write really good lyrics for you. I know a guy named Bernie Taupin who's working at Moth Burger right now. I'll give him a call.	[]
Elton	5	0	That's a great idea!	[]
Chef	18	1	And, Elton, why don't you get yourself some new threads? You know; some slick glasses and shit.	['shit']
Elton	25	0	And so I got Bernie to write my lyrics. And if it wasn't for Chef, I would never have had a career in music.	[]
Stan	13	0	So will you buy some of our candy bars to help him out?	[]
Elton	10	0	Yes, of course. I'll buy three Crispy Yum Yums.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Three Crispy Yum Yums.	[]
Stan	17	0	Hey, Elton, if I give you these lyrics, will you write a song for my girlfriend, Wendy?	[]
Elton	32	0	Sure, kid. But I would retain exclusive worldwide rights,  including but not limited to Asian territories, with a 20% commission from all domestic sales, and sole ownership of any and all publishing.	[]
Stan	1	0	'Kay.	[]
Elton	5	0	Tell Chef I said hi.	[]
Stan	2	0	Thanks, dude.	[]
Kyle	11	0	Dude, we'll have Chef's $2 million in no time!	[]
Sheila	4	0	Oy..! Thank you, Chef.	[]
Chef	10	0	No problem, Ms. Broflovski. Uhh, now, about that hundred bucks?	[]
Sheila	9	0	Oh, of course!  Here you go.  Leaving so soon?	[]
Chef	22	0	I have a lo-o-o-o-o-ong way to come to go to raise the kind of money I need.	[]
Sheila	7	0	Well, best of luck to you, then.	[]
Gerald	4	0	How was it, honey?	[]
Sheila	5	0	Pretty much what I expected.	[]
Stan	5	0	Hello, are you Meat Loaf?	[]
Meat Loaf	7	1	Yeah. What the hell do you want?	['hell']

Kyle	5	0	Yeah. Do you know him?	[]
Meat Loaf	2	0	Do I?	[]
Cous-Cous	3	0	Nobody came again.	[]
Chef	17	0	There, there, Cous-Cous. It'll be all right. Maybe you just need to change your image.	[]
Cous-Cous	4	0	What do you mean?	[]
Chef	16	0	Nobody wants to see a guy named Cous-Cous. You need a big, strong beefy name.	[]
Cous-Cous	5	0	Beefy? Like, uhh... Tri-tip!	[]
Chef	9	0	That's not bad. Here, have some meat loaf.	[]
Meat Loaf	5	0	I owe everything to Chef.	[]
Stan	6	0	Wow! So you'll help him?	[]
Meat Loaf	16	0	You bet. Give me a box of Nilla Yum Yums and a couple of Berry Bars.	[]
Boys	1	0	Cool!	[]
Ms. Crabtree	13	0	All right, let's get this show on the road! Come here, baby!	[]
Chef	17	1	Uh-uh, hold on a second, Ms. Crabtree. How would you like to use some... sex toys?	['sex']
Ms. Crabtree	4	1	Sex toys? Like what?	['sex']
Chef	12	0	Like this very special device.  I call it Chef's pleasure bag.	[]
Ms. Crabtree	4	0	How does it work?	[]
Chef	18	1	Now, all you do is put this paper bag over your head, and it increases your sexual pleasure.	['sexual']
Ms. Crabtree	9	1	Really? Well, hell, let's give it a shot.	['hell']
Chef	6	0	Ahh, yeah. That's much better.	[]
Rick James	15	0	Sure. I'll do anything for Chef. Give me a box of those Choco-Numbers.	[]

Stan	19	0	Yeah, thanks.  That's $35. Come on, you guys, we've gotta hurry and give this money to Chef!	[]
Mayor	7	0	Ohh, that was wonderful, Chef. Good show.	[]
Chef	10	0	I can't keep doing this. It's killing me.	[]
Mayor	7	0	Oh, come on, buck up, little fella.	[]

Barbrady	4	0	Can I go now?	[]
Mr. Garrison	5	0	Yes-Yes, I'm sorry.	[]
Barbrady	1	0	Weirdo.	[]
Mr. Garrison	11	0	It can't be. These can't be right.  Mr. Hat!	[]

Chef	22	0	It's over, children. I couldn't raise the $2 million to hire Johnnie Cochran. Now I have to go to jail.	[]
Stan	4	0	No, you don't!	[]
Chef	1	0	Huh?	[]
Kyle	19	0	We went to a bunch of rock stars and sold them candy bars to raise the money you needed.	[]
Chef	8	0	Did what?! Wow! How much did you make?	[]
Kyle	1	0	Cartman?	[]
Cartman	20	0	Well, you can see here that we raised approximately $95, falling well short of our $2 million goal illustrated here.	[]
Chef	1	0	Oh.	[]
Kyle	23	0	But we can put our money together with the money you made whoring yourself to all the women. How much did you make?	[]
Chef	6	0	I made about $410,300, but--	[]
Producer	10	0	That doesn't matter, because that money belongs to me!	[]
Stan	10	0	You can't take Chef's money! It's illeg--!	[]
Producer	5	0	I am above the law!	[]
Officer	8	0	All right, you, it's time to go.	[]

Kyle	6	0	But what are we gonna do?	[]
Stan	6	0	It's easy, dude. Chef Aid.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Chef Aid?	[]
Stan	19	0	Yeah. We set up a stage, and have Cartman do the German Dance. Then we charge people for tickets.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Hey, that's a great idea!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Mr. Garrison	93	4	Did you think I would just take you back? Like you can just, walk out and then, come back like nothing happened? Oh, don't look at me like that, Mr. Hat. Remember, you're the one that left.  I'm not going to take you back.  You can just go to hell!  You go to hell and you die!  You are a lying bowl of turd, Mr. Hat!

I know he seems guilty, but ladies and gentlemen, this... is Chewbacca.  Now think about that for one minute. That does not make sense. Why am I talkin' about Chewbacca when a man's life is on the line?  Why? I tell you why. I don't know. It doesn't make sense. If Chewbacca does not make sense, you must acquit!  Here, look at the monkey. Look at the silly monkey.	[]
