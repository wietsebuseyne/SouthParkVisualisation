Stan	2	0	Wow, dude.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Man, Indians have it good, huh?	[]
Randy	11	0	Now, Eric, they're called Native Americans, remember? Show some respect.	[]
Native American Chief	24	0	Welcome to the Three Feathers Casino. I'm your host, Chief Runs With Premise. Please try your luck at one of our many games.	[]
Cartman	5	0	All right, let's go!	[]
Runs With Premise	11	0	Halt.  I am afraid minors cannot go onto the casino floor.	[]
Cartman	14	1	I'm not a miner, dumbass! Do you see a shovel in my hand?!	['dumbass']
Runs With Premise	9	0	You kids can enjoy our Native American Comedy Club.	[]
Gerald	19	0	All right, we're gonna hit the tables. Why don't you kids run along to the comedy club?	[]

Sheila	7	0	Well I don't wanna play here!	[]
Sharon	11	0	Yeah. Come on, Sheila, let's go to the nickel slots.	[]
Randy	18	0	Oooo, the nickel slots! You might win the thirty-dollar jackpot! Ahh, women, huh? God I hate 'em.	[]

Announcer	15	0	Welcome to the Three Feathers Comedy Club. Please put your hands together for Johnny Manymoons!	[]
Kyle	6	0	What is Native American comedy, anyway?	[]
Manymoons	29	0	Thank you, thank you. Bear walked into a bar. Bear said to Deer, May I please... have a drink? And so Deer said to Bear, Why the big paws?	[]
Audience	16	0	Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha!	[]
Manymoons	46	0	Many moons ago, Pony and Eagle walked up to Coyote. Pony said to Coyote, I am very mad at Eagle. Will you yell at him for me? Coyote said to Pony, Why can you not yell yourself? And Pony replied, Because I am a little horse.	[]
Audience	8	0	Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha!	[]
Randy	5	0	How's it goin', Gerald?	[]
Gerald	4	0	Ohh, not so good.	[]
Randy	12	0	Yeah, I know what you mean. I'm down three hundred bucks.	[]
Gerald	7	0	Yeah. I'm down twenty-six thousand.	[]
Randy	10	0	Yeah, well, maybe we should- ...wait. Twenty-six thousand dollars??	[]
Gerald	11	0	I forgot to tell you, ah I have a gambling problem.	[]
Randy	4	0	Gerald, twenty-six thousand-!	[]
Gerald	11	0	Sshhhh! I have to win it back before Sheila finds out!	[]
Randy	8	0	Where did you get that kind of money??	[]
Gerald	20	0	The casino gave me credit! I put the house up as collateral! But I still have this ten-dollar chip.	[]
Blackjack Dealer	4	0	Dealer, twenty one.  Sorry.	[]
Gerald	23	0	That's it. I'm destitute.  Loan me money! You've gotta have money in the cup!  Wha- what's in the cup?	[]
Randy	3	0	Just six quarters!	[]
Gerald	4	0	Oh God. Oh Jesus.	[]
Blackjack Dealer	18	0	Thank you for playing at Three Feathers. May your life be filled with the song of the sparrow.	[]
Gerald	10	1	Oh, shove the song of the sparrow up your ass!	['ass']
Gerald	28	0	How am I going to tell my family?  How do I tell them that tomorrow, we have to ...pack up our things and ...get out of the house?	[]
Sheila	3	0	There's daddy!	[]
Gerald	2	0	Oh, Jesus.	[]
Sheila	11	0	Where have you guys been? We've been looking all over.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Yeah. Come on, Dad, this place sucks. I wanna go.	[]
Gerald	5	0	What, What did you say?	[]
Kyle	5	0	I said I wanna leave.	[]
Gerald	28	0	Oh, you wanna leave, huh?! Okay, fine, Kyle, when we get home, we'll just pack up our things, load them in the car, and we'll leave!	[]
Kyle	6	0	What?? No, no, I mean, I-	[]
Gerald	14	0	No, no, no, if you wanna leave South Park, fine! Tomorrow we're leaving!	[]
Sheila	6	0	Gerald, what are you talking about?	[]
Gerald	27	0	Oh, you heard him, Sheila! Kyle wants to leave! Our nice old house doesn't interest Kyle anymore! Well I'm calling the moving company right now!	[]
Cartman	9	1	Well, you shouldn't be such a dick, dude.	['dick']
Sharon	5	0	What's wrong with Gerald?	[]
Randy	9	0	He... he lost his house to the Native Americans.	[]
Sharon	14	0	What?? But don't the Native Americans know he has nowhere else to go?	[]
Randy	4	0	They don't care.	[]
Runs with Premise	11	0	Look at them! Small-minded idiots pouring their life-savings away!	[]
Elder 1	11	0	Their cash flows out of them like diarrhea from the buffalo.	[]
Elder 2	28	0	Yes, but we have milked this simple mountain folk almost dry. If we really want to see cash flow, we need to bring in city people from Denver.	[]
Runs with Premise	19	0	Yeessss. It is time for us to implement our plan.  A superhighway, built from Denver right to our casino!	[]
Aide 1	19	0	And what do we do about the small town of South Park that lies in the highway's way?	[]
Runs with Premise	16	0	Simple. We buy it, and we demolish it! Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha!	[]
Elders	4	0	Ha ha ha ha!	[]
Mayor McDaniels	29	0	And that's really all I can tell you. The town of South Park is going to be leveled, in order to make way for a twelve-lane superhighway.	[]
Randy	6	0	But how can they do that?!	[]
Mayor McDaniels	24	0	The Native Americans have purchased the land from under us. Tomorrow, they're buying the last of what they need to have complete ownership.	[]
Jimbo	11	0	Well can't we stop them? Let's call the bank.	[]
Mayor McDaniels	6	0	The Native Americans bought the bank.	[]
Mr. Garrison	3	0	Oh my God.	[]
Mayor McDaniels	18	0	Now, look, it isn't all horrible. The Native Americans are offering you retail values on your homes.	[]
Randy	15	0	No, screw that! We'll just pool our money together and buy the town ourselves!	[]
Chef	9	0	Yeah! Let the South Park people own South Park!	[]
Randy	8	0	How much do we have to raise, Mayor?	[]
Mayor McDaniels	4	0	Three hundred thousand dollars.	[]
Randy	3	0	Ohhh, never mind.	[]
Butters	14	0	How can they do that, huh? How can they make us all move away?	[]
Cartman	7	1	Because they're rich, greedy-ass Indians!	['ass']
Kyle	2	0	Native Americans.	[]
Stan	11	0	Our whole town, gone. We'd had such great times here.	[]
Stan	20	0	We can't let them do it, you guys! We have to find a way to stop those Native Americans!	[]
The boys	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Alex	5	0	Yeah, this is our town!	[]
Stan	17	0	We shouldn't have to make a bunch of new friends somewhere else. We're a team!	[]
"Kyle, Butters, Tweek"	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Cartman	3	0	That's right!	[]
Butters	5	0	Yeah, ahh, that's right!	[]
Alex	5	0	Yeah, we're a team!	[]
Stan	13	0	We just gotta figure out a way to raise three hundred thousand dollars!	[]
Cartman	39	0	Wait a minute! I've got it, you guys! We can get Kyle infected with AIDS! And then start a charity organization that we steal money from! Come on, let's go!  No? We can't give Kyle AIDS?	[]
Stan	9	0	We need something that'll get us money tomorrow!	[]
Butters	8	0	Hey, I know! How about a dog parade?	[]
Kyle	2	0	Dog parade?	[]
Butters	21	0	Yeah! We dress up all our dogs in little outfits, and parade them down the street.  It'll be so adorable!	[]
Kyle	10	0	How do we make three hundred thousand dollars doing that?	[]
Butters	12	0	Oh... Uh well, we could sell tickets to our moms and dads.	[]
Stan	11	0	Our moms and dads are the ones who need money, Butters!	[]
Butters	1	0	Oh...	[]
Cartman	10	0	Maybe give Kyle AIDS, huh? Lookin' a little better now.	[]
Sheila	7	0	Oh, Gerald, I, I can't watch!	[]
Randy	7	0	How can you do this to people?	[]
Runs with Premise	17	0	We're sorry. But if we do not build a superhighway, our casino might stop seeing profits.	[]
Randy	7	0	There's more to life than profits!	[]
Runs with Premise	3	0	Well like what?	[]
Randy	7	0	Well like, you know, Slurpees and stuff.	[]
Chris	15	0	Well, come on, honey, I guess we should start packing up our things as well.	[]
Mr. Garrison	5	0	Yeah.  So long, South Park.	[]
Stan	14	0	Mom! Dad! We figured out a way we could raise three hundred thousand dollars!	[]
Chris	3	0	A dog parade?	[]
Stan	1	0	No!	[]
Randy	20	0	Stan, we've all tried to raise money, but we only raise ten thousand dollars, and the deadline is tomorrow.	[]
Stan	19	0	I know. So how about we take the ten thousand dollars back to the Indian casino? Tell them, Kyle!	[]
Kyle	28	0	The odds on a single number in roulette are thirty-five to one.  That means, with a ten thousand dollar bet, you win three hundred and fifty thousand.	[]
Sheila	4	0	Boys, that's ridiculous.	[]
Stan	8	0	Look, we- we've got nothing to lose.	[]
Chef	5	0	What do you guys think?	[]
Jimbo	5	0	It's a long shot.	[]
Randy	14	0	Yeah.  But it's the only shot we've got to save our town.	[]
Runs With Premise	45	0	The residents of South Park had hoped to raise three hundred thousand dollars. but in the end managed to raise only ten. The loss of their town may be imminent for the poor people of South Park.  Awww, I think I'm going to cuwhy.	[]
Two Elders	8	0	HA ha ha ha! HA ha ha ha!	[]
Randy	10	0	All right, boys. You're gonna have to wait here.	[]
Stan	3	0	Dad.  Good luck.	[]
Randy	10	0	It's in God's hand now.  Stand aside, everyone!	[]
Runs With Premise	4	0	What are they doing?	[]
Randy	22	0	We're gonna try and beat you at your own game, Chief Runs With Premise! Ten thousand dollars!  On thirty one black!	[]
Runs With Premise	1	0	Impossible!	[]
Stan	4	0	Come on! Come on!	[]
Runs With Premise	3	0	Thirty one. Black.	[]
Townsfolk	18	0	Yeah! All right! Woohoo! Oh we did it! We did it! Oh my God! Oh this is amazing!	[]
Runs With Premise	2	0	No... NOOO!	[]
Alex	4	0	South Park is saved.	[]
Mr. Mackey	9	0	We have plenty enough to save our town now!	[]
Gerald	23	0	Yeah! But wait.  Three hundred and fifty thousand dollars. That means if we won again, it will be twelve and a quarter million!	[]
Mr. Garrison	9	0	We can save the town and be super-rich!	[]
Randy	6	1	Oh hell yeah! Let it ride!	['hell']
Gerald	3	0	Let it ride!!	[]
Townsfolk	2	0	Woohoo! Yeah!	[]
Kyle	6	1	What the hell are they doing??	['hell']
Jimbo	9	0	Let's go thirty one! Let's see it!	[]
Roulette Dealer	4	0	Two, red. You lose.	[]
Townsfolk	1	0	AWWWWWWW!!	[]
Randy	1	1	Dammit!	['dammit']
Runs With Premise	1	0	Hmmm!	[]
Stan	8	0	They, they had it! They freakin' had it!	[]
Stan	14	0	You totally had it! You had enough to save the town and then some.	[]
Randy	25	0	Stan? Okay? You just don't understand the fine points of gambling. You're never supposed to stop when you're on a winning streak.	[]
Stan	7	0	A winning streak??!! You played one game!!!!	[]
Randy	2	0	Stan? Okay?	[]
Stan	1	0	What???	[]
Randy	4	0	All right? Stan? Okay?	[]
Stan	9	0	You people just got greedy, like the Native Americans!	[]
Randy	54	1	Hey, mister!! We're not like them, all right?!  Now, we may have pie in the sky dreams once in a while, but we aren't the ones kicking people out of their homes! So don't you compare us to those cold-hearted, money-grubbing, evil stinky Indians!  I'm sorry, Native Americans.	['stinky']
Elder 2	16	0	There you are, sir. There's the check for your home. Just sign here, and here.	[]
Mr. Garrison	10	0	Well, this is it, Mr. Slave. We're officially homeless.	[]
Mr. Slave	3	0	Jesus! Jesus Christ!	[]
Stan	11	0	Dad, what are you doing?! Don't take their dirty money!	[]
Randy	26	0	Stanley, we don't have a choice. The Native Americans own South Park now. We have to take what they'll give us for our homes.	[]
Elder 3	7	0	There you go. Have a nice day.	[]
Stan	8	0	Come on, you guys! This is our town!	[]
Mr. Mackey	9	0	It's over, Stanley. What else can we do?	[]
Stan	5	0	We can stay. And fight.	[]
Cartman	16	1	Yeah! When the Indians come to tear up our town, we kick 'em in the nuts!	['nuts']
Kenny	1	0	(Yeah!)	[]
Alex	9	0	Yeah! They don't own our town! We do!	[]
Chef	10	0	I'm sorry, boys. You just don't understand economics.	[]
Randy	14	0	It'll be okay, boys, we'll just... move to the next town over.	[]
Stan	48	0	Oh sure. Until the Native Americans decide they want that land, too! What if the Native Americans just keep building their casinos and their highways uh, until we have nowhere else to go?? We have to stand up to them now!  Rrrgh! Forget it! Come on, you guys!	[]
Cartman	9	1	You're all a bunch of God-damned pussies!	['damned']
Runs with Premise	5	0	Get out of our way!	[]
Stan	9	0	No! We won't let you destroy our town!	[]
Runs with Premise	7	0	Boys. It isn't your town anymore.	[]
Stan	66	0	Just because you have a piece of paper saying you own it doesn't make it yours. We grew up here. Our parents grew up here. We shop at that Wal-Mart, and eat at that Chili's. We take fish from the streams and bread them and freeze them to make fish sticks. This is not just a town, it is our way of life.	[]
Elder 1	13	0	Well your way of life is about to change, little boys. Now move!	[]
Kyle	13	0	You can't just roll into places and take people's lives away!	[]
A Driver	13	0	And what are four little boys going to do to stop us, huh?	[]
Townsfolk	29	0	We are strong No one can tell us we're wrong Searching our hearts for so lohh-oo-ohh-oo-ong Both of us knowing... Love Is A Battlefield	[]
Stan	6	0	This land is not for sale.	[]
Runs with Premise	9	1	Dammit! I thought you said they were dealt with!	['dammit']
Elder 1	2	0	They were!	[]
Mr. Garrison	11	1	Sorry, Charlies! You can just keep your filthy bastard Indian money!	['bastard']
Principal Victoria	5	1	Filthy bastard Native American money!	['bastard']
Mr. Garrison	7	0	Uh oh, right, huh. Sorry about that.	[]
Runs with Premise	4	0	This isn't over!	[]
Jimbo	7	1	We'll never give up! You bastards!	['bastards']
Alex	5	0	Yeah! South Park is ours.	[]
Mr. Mackey	19	0	But, what do we do now? I mean, we can't just stand here and block their way forever.	[]
Randy	9	0	We can stand here as long as it takes.	[]
Runs with Premise	7	0	What is the state of our people?	[]
Elder 2	34	0	Last night I spoke with the spirit of the bear, and Bear said that if we do not build our highway soon, our investors may soon sell off their shares of the new casino.	[]
Elder 1	21	0	Yes, and Eagle says the cumulative shared market loss on the revenue of the new casino drops fifteen percent every day.	[]
Runs with Premise	12	0	Then we must force the South Park people off their petty land.	[]
Elder 1	30	0	But they are determined and proud. And the spirit of the wind has stated that if we use force, it could be a publicity nightmare, further hurting our net assets.	[]
Runs with Premise	21	0	I already have a plan how we can force them off our land... sneakily.  We're going to give them...  blankets.	[]
Elder 1	1	0	Blankets?	[]
Runs with Premise	92	0	Yes. We will present the blankets as a peace offering. But what the round-eyes will not know is that the blankets are infected with SARS.  They will all get SARS! And then SARS will run through their town like a buffalo. Now I need your help getting the SARS onto the blankets.  Okay, bring them in!  Let's see how South Park deals with this!  Everyone grab a Chinese person and rub them on a blanket.  Make sure you rub them all over. Get the SARS nice and deep in there.	[]
Field Reporter	44	0	Tom, I'm standing in chilly South Park, Colorado, where the residents are entering the third day of their sit-in to try and stop Native Americans from building a superhighway through their town. The temperature is low, but spirits are pretty low, too.	[]
Randy	4	0	What do they want?	[]
Mr. Garrison	5	1	We're not moving, assfaces!	['assfaces']
Runs with Premise	42	0	Free blanket?  Though I know we have differences, we believe a compromise can be reached. In the meantime, it hurts us to see you all on television sitting in the cold. Will you not take this offering as a gesture of goodwill?	[]
Mr. Garrison	6	0	You had me at free blanket.	[]
Elders	6	0	Free blanket? Free blanket? Free blanket...	[]
Field Reporter	38	0	Tom, it now looks as if the Native Americans are handing out blankets as a sign of goodwill towards the South Park people. What an incredible display of compassion. I certainly hope there's nothing sinister behind it.	[]
Runs with Premise	7	0	Please. As a token of good faith.	[]
Randy	11	0	You... understand if I'm a little wary of trusting you.	[]
Runs with Premise	7	0	It is only a blanket, Mister Marsh.	[]
Randy	2	0	Well, thanks.	[]
Runs with Premise	4	0	Oh. You're welcome.	[]
Field Reporter	74	0	Tom, it's Tuesday morning now, and the outbreak of SARS in South Park has reached epic proportions.  The entire town has been quarantined by the federal government, nobody allowed in our out, which means, nobody can come to our aid.  It appears this town, and this reporter, are done for. Coming up next, choosing the right hair conditioner. What you don't know about hair care products could be costing you a bundle.	[]
Stan	5	0	It's all right, dad.	[]
Randy	4	0	How's your... mother?	[]
Stan	9	0	She's hanging in there.  Here, drink some beer.	[]
Randy	6	0	It's cool on my tongue.	[]
Stan	6	0	You're gonna be all right.	[]
Randy	19	0	Stanley, listen to me. I have SARS. There's only a ninety-eight percent chance that I will live.	[]
Stan	3	0	No, Dad, NO.	[]
Randy	29	0	Listen, Stan. SARS is destroying our people. The Native Americans put it in the blankets they gave us.  Soon there will be only ninety-eight percent of us left.	[]
Stan	4	0	What can I do?	[]
Randy	12	0	You... must find a cure for SARS, son. And save our people.	[]
Stan	4	0	Cure SARS? Aw, Jesus!	[]
Randy	22	0	The spirit of middle-class white people is strong in you, son. Seek out the wise man in Bellocreek. Now go. GO!	[]
Wise Man	1	0	What?	[]
Stan	8	0	Hey, my name's Stan, and I was-	[]
Wise Man	18	0	Your coming was foretold to me. You've come to save our people. Come in.  Watch the cats.	[]
Stan	9	0	Uh so, do you know how to cure SARS?	[]
Wise Man	21	0	Me?? Huh, no. I am just a guide. Sit down.  You must find the answer yourself, by taking an inward journey.	[]
Stan	8	1	An inward journey? That sounds kind of gay.	['gay']
Wise Man	17	0	Let the voices of our ancestors show you the way.  Breathe. Breathe from the bag of visions.	[]
Stan	3	0	Ah! Oh, dude!	[]
Runs with Premise	9	0	How much longer must we wait for our superhighway??	[]
Elder 1	19	0	SARS has spread through the entire town of South Park, Chief Runs with Premise. Their wills will break soon.	[]
Runs with Premise	7	0	Then I suppose we must be patient.	[]
Woman	5	0	Runs with Premise, come quickly!	[]
Runs with Premise	5	0	What is the matter, wife?	[]
Woman	11	0	It is our son, Premise Running Thin. He is very sick.	[]
Runs with Premise	7	0	Premise Running Thin, what is the matter?	[]
Woman	15	0	He, he shared a cup with one of the people from China. He has SARS!	[]
Runs with Premise	8	0	No! I told you not to touch them!	[]
Premise Running Thin	2	0	Papa. Papa...	[]
Medicine Man	22	0	I have given him herbs from the desert plant and water from the cactus of life. But nothing seems to be working.	[]
Runs with Premise	29	0	This would never have happened if those townspeople would have just moved away! No more waiting around! Tomorrow we begin the final stage of our plan! Shock and Awe!	[]
Randy	16	0	Stanley. Did you have an inward journey with the old man? Did you have a vision??	[]
Stan	37	0	Ah, I don't know if I did or not. I, I saw something, someone spoke to me and... told me the middle-class white way to cure SARS.  Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup, Dayquil, and Sprite.	[]
Randy	12	0	Yes. Yes, of course. Quickly, Stan, we must give it to everyone!	[]
Kyle	19	0	Boy, that really did the trick, Stan. I thought we were kind of, sort of, not really done for.	[]
Alex	9	0	Thanks to you, we're all safe now, Stan.	[]
Runs with Premise	26	0	Now, I will blow your weak, SARS-infested bodies off the Earth!  What the?  Wait a minute.  Stop! Stop!  Your, your SARS. Where did it go?	[]
Randy	10	0	We have cured ourselves using the medicines of our culture.	[]
Runs with Premise	15	0	My son... Premise Running Thin has the SARS as well.  You... you can cure him?	[]
Elder 1	40	0	It is amazing. All our plants and herbs failed to heal him, but your people's remedy brings the spirit of the buffalo back into his heart. Perhaps there are many things we can learn from your way of life.	[]
Randy	16	0	We're a simple people. All we want is to be allowed to live our lives.	[]
Runs with Premise	40	0	You have cured Premise Running Thin. In return, I shall give you all five dollars credit at the casino.  All right, all right, I will not build a superhighway through your town. And you can all have your homes back.	[]
Townsfolk	4	0	All right! Yeah!  Woohoo!	[]
Alex	24	0	Well, I guess we all learned that South Park is more than just a town. It's a community that nobody can split up.	[]
Stan	6	1	Dude, who the hell are you?	['hell']
Alex	14	0	Alex. Alex Glick. I got to come on and do the guest voice thingy.	[]
Kyle	7	1	What?! Get the hell out of here!	['hell']
Alex	6	0	Hi Mom! Hi Dad! Hi Joe!	[]
