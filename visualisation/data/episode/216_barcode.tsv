Stan	7	0	Mom, I'm 10 years old now.	[]
Sharon	19	0	I've told you what I think of this music, Stanley. You have plenty of other gifts to enjoy.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Looks like somebody's on the rag, huh Mom?	[]
Randy	14	0	Sharon? Stan told me you took away his music CD at his birthday party.	[]
Sharon	18	0	Oh for crying out loud, I gave him a great party and that's all he cares about.	[]
Randy	20	0	Well, do you really thnk we should be telling our son what music he can and can't listen to?	[]
Sharon	11	0	Yes I do, if it's that stupid Tween Wave garbage!	[]
Randy	2	0	Tween Wave?	[]
Sharon	18	1	You haven't heard it? It's terrible! It's hardly even music; it just sounds like crap!	['crap']
Randy	21	1	Sharon, come on. Don't you remember being younger and having our parents say the music we liked sounded like crap?	['crap']
Sharon	3	0	This is different!	[]
Randy	20	1	...So. Here we are. Now we're the old people who think the younger generation's music sounds like shit.	['shit']
Sharon	15	0	It's... not because I'm older. I'm telling you, our music is better.	[]
Randy	19	0	Back in my day our music was better! Not this garbage the young 'un listen to. Warber warber warber.	[]
Sharon	18	1	Fine, Randy!  You go listen to it and tell me you don't think it sounds like crap!	['crap']
Randy	16	0	I'd love to. I'm not an old fuddy-duddy, Sharon. I'm still cool.	[]
Sharon	6	1	Well, it sounds like crap, right?!	['crap']
Randy	7	0	Uh... NO I mean...  I like it.	[]
Sharon	8	1	Oh come on! That music sounds like shit!	['shit']
Randy	14	0	No, it's just... young and hip so you don't get it, Sharon.	[]
Sharon	10	1	Admit it, Randy! You think it sounds like crap too!	['crap']
Randy	13	1	It doesn't sound like crap at all! I think it's awesome!	['crap']
Anchorman	46	1	It's called Tween Wave, and if you're a parent your kids are probably listening to it. A new music genre for the era from 2009 through 2012. or The Tweens. Every generation has their music, but many parents say Tween Wave sounds like crap.	['crap']
Man 1	13	0	It's just vulgar and stupid, you know? Music used to be good.	[]
Woman 1	4	1	This sounds like poo.	['poo']
Man 2	13	0	I certainly don't understand kids' music today. Sounds like diarrhea to me.	[]
Anchorman	10	1	Kids however say they don't hear crap at all.	['crap']
Kid 1	3	0	Parents are dumb.	[]
Kid 2	5	0	They don't get it.	[]
Kid 1	8	0	They don't get it. Parents are stupid.	[]
Kid 3	4	0	Tween Wave is swick.	[]
Kid 4	16	0	Tweem Wave is super swick and parents don't get it, 'cause their ears are old.	[]
Kid 5	3	0	Parents are dumb.	[]
Sharon	24	0	We're sorry boys, but we have all decided that as of now, none of you are allowed to listen to Tween Wave music.	[]
Randy	5	0	Ugh, that's so unfair!	[]
Kyle	8	0	But that's our music! We like it!	[]
Randy	4	0	Yeah it's good!	[]
Sheila	12	1	What's good about a bunch of crap sounds to a drumbeat?	['crap']
Stan	17	0	We don't know what you're talking about! It doesn't sound that way to us!	[]
Randy	10	0	Yeah it, it doesn't sound like that to us.	[]
Gerald	30	0	I wanna educate you kids with some real music.  This is The Police. Now you compare this to Tween pop and tell us which one you think is real music.	[]
The Boys	1	0	Yuck!	[]
Randy	1	0	What?	[]
Stan	4	1	That sounds like shit!	['shit']
Gerald	12	2	Whattaya mean it sounds like shit? This doesn't sound like shit.	['shit', 'shit']
Kyle	1	0	Gross!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Turn it off dude!	[]
Sharon	24	0	Stanley I want you to understand that even though I won't let you listen to certain kinds of music, I still love you.	[]
Stan	7	0	I know, Mom. I love you too.	[]
Sharon	24	0	Soon you'll be old enough to make your own choices, but for now, I just don't want you listening to that stuff.	[]
Stan	6	0	It's okay, Mom. I understand.	[]
Sharon	9	0	That's very mature of you, Stanley. Goodnight, sweetie.	[]
Stan	6	1	'Night.  Haha.  Ugh.  What the hell?	['hell']
Kyle	17	0	Oh dude! Dude, this is the part I was talking about. Check out the bassline on this!	[]
Cartman	11	0	Oh yeah, that one's cool.  Yeah, this part's killer.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Hey Stan.	[]
Stan	2	0	Hey dudes.	[]
Kyle	16	0	Dude, have you really listened to the sixth track? I think it's my new favorite.	[]
Stan	18	0	Yeah, yeah I've listened to it. Um, Kyle, can I talk to you alone for a second?	[]
Kyle	4	0	Sure.  What's up?	[]
Stan	38	0	Kyle, I have to admit something to you. You know how I told you over the phone I like the new Gersploosh album? I lied. I don't like it. I don't like it at all, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Oh. Really? Um well that's okay.	[]
Stan	18	0	No, you don't understand dude. Something's happened. Tween Wave doesn't sound the same to me.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Why? What's it sound like?	[]
Stan	6	1	It... kind of sounds like shit.	['shit']
Kyle	15	0	What? You mean like you don't like the singing, or the lyrics, or what?	[]
Stan	22	2	No. I mean it sounds like somebody is shitting in my ears. Please, just listen really close.  You don't hear shit?	['shitting', 'shit']
Kyle	1	0	No.	[]
Stan	8	1	That doesn't sound like shit to you?	['shit']
Kyle	8	0	NO. Dude, maybe you should see a doctor.	[]
Stan	24	1	And so then I put on exactly the same album that I really like a year ago, and it sounded like shit to me.	['shit']
Doctor	22	1	Uh huh, and what about food? Are some of the things you thought tasted good tasting like shit to you now, too?	['shit']
Stan	23	1	Yeah. I used to love these Pop Rock things, and I tried them the other day and I thought they tasted like shit.	['shit']
Doctor	7	0	This says you had a birthday recently?	[]
Stan	4	0	I just turned 10.	[]
Doctor	21	0	Well, that makes sense. You see Stan, as you get older, your eardrums, taste buds, all that stuff develops and changes.	[]
Stan	4	0	So this is normal?	[]
Doctor	34	0	It's very normal. Let's just do a quick ear exam. I'm gonna play some Tween Wave music and you tell me what you hear.  What's that sound like to you?	[]
Stan	3	1	Sounds like shit.	['shit']
Doctor	13	0	Aha. Now I'm going to play you some good ole Bob Dylan.	[]
Stan	6	1	Uh that sounds like shit too.	['shit']
Doctor	7	1	Wait, this sounds like shit to you?	['shit']
Stan	6	1	Yeah dude, it's just shit.	['shit']
Doctor	47	1	Well that's very strange.  Hm, I'm gonna try somethin' else.  Look at these two pictures. One of them is an ad for Kevin James' new movie The Zookeeper, and the other is a turd in a microwave. Which one is the ad for The Zookeeper?	['turd']
Stan	5	0	They both look the same.	[]
Doctor	9	0	You don't see any difference in the pictures?	[]
Stan	1	0	No.	[]
Doctor	16	1	That is an ad for The Zookeeper and  that is a turd about to be reheated.	['turd']
Stan	11	0	They both look like turds about to be reheated to me.	[]
Doctor	67	5	Oh dear. I think I know what this is. You see Stan, as you get older, things that you used to like start looking and sounding like shit. And things that seemed shitty as a child don't seem as shitty. With you, somehow, the wires have gotten crossed and everything looks and sounds like shit to you. It's a condition called being a cynical asshole.	['shit', 'shitty', 'shitty', 'shit', 'asshole']
Stan	2	0	Oh no.	[]
Doctor	27	2	Yes. And there's no known cure, I'm afraid. Everything just seems shitty, and everyone starts to seem shitty, and everything they say just starts to	['shitty', 'shitty']
Sharon	12	0	Randy, do you mind cleaning up the garage like I asked you?	[]
Randy	12	0	Get out of my room! I'm listening to my music! Gau!	[]
Sharon	22	2	Stop pretending to like the kids' music, Randy! It's pathetic! You know damn well it sounds like crap to you too!	['damn', 'crap']
Randy	10	1	No it doesn't sound like crap to me!  Ugh.	['crap']
Sharon	41	1	Randy, don't you see what this is? You had dreams of being a rock star when you were younger, now you can't admit the next generation's music sounds shitty, it's called getting older, Randy. It's okay.	['shitty']
Randy	22	0	That's not true! I think Tween Wave music is complex and awesome and it speaks to my youthful rebellious spirit, Sharon!	[]
Sharon	15	1	It's crap, Randy! It's so simple and stupid that anybody could play it!	['crap']
Randy	9	0	Anybody could play it. Do you really think so?	[]
Randy	71	0	Hey everybody. Wanna thank you all for coming tonight. My name's Steamy Ray Vaughn and here's a little bit of Rattlesnake.  A-1 2 3 4! I've got a fever but it's under control!  I said I've got a fever need to take it kind of slow  I've got a fever but it's out of control. Ga ga, ga ga, la ga ga ga.	[]
Bar Patron	2	0	You suck!	[]
Randy	12	0	No, you just don't understand Tween Wave 'cause you're old!	[]
Janitor/Farmer 1	10	0	Did you know we're livin' in the Tween time?	[]
Farmer 2	6	0	Nah, I'd a heard that.	[]
Janitor/Farmer 1	34	2	Guess it's the period between 2009 and 2013. They call it the Tweens. So they got this feller down at the bowling alley? He gets up on the stage an' shits his britches.	['shits', 'britches']
Farmer Friend 2	2	0	What fer?	[]
Janitor/Farmer 1	41	2	I don't know. But he gets up there and strums a gueetar and then starts loadin' his britches up like it's goin' out of style.  It's like some kind of britches holocaust. Feller calls himself Steamy Ray Vaughn.	['britches', 'britches']
Farmer 2	14	0	You mean that guy that plays the blues and died in an airplane crash?	[]
Janitor/Farmer 1	13	2	Nnooh. That's Stevie Ray Vaughn. Steamy Ray Vaughn just shits his britches.	['shits', 'britches']
Cartman	5	0	Ohooh dude, sweet! Tackle him!	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Get him!)	[]
Kyle	12	0	Alright guys, do you think he's lying or telling the truth?	[]
Cartman	6	0	He's lying, dude. Hit X	[]
Kenny	6	0	(No, he's telling the truth)	[]
Stan	2	0	Hey guys.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Hey, Stan. What did the doctor say?	[]
Stan	5	0	He said I have cynicism?	[]
Kyle	3	0	What's that?	[]
Stan	39	1	Something you can get when you get older but, it's stupid. I'm not cynical. All the doctor wants is a paycheck. I went to him for help and he just stood there spouting a bunch of shit.	['shit']
Kyle	10	0	Oh. Well, come on, we're playing L.A. Noire.	[]
Stan	21	1	Agh, that shitty game? Who plays video games to listen to a bunch of characters talk and press the X button?	['shitty']
Cartman	8	0	Oh, ask him about the murder now, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Yeah, we got him!	[]
Stan	17	0	How can people say this game is cool? It doesn't even matter what choices you make.	[]
Kenny	5	0	(Hit the X button, Kyle!)	[]
Kyle	7	0	We're gonna level up to detective!	[]
Stan	10	1	That's such a shitty device to keep people playing.	['shitty']
Kyle	9	0	Alright, ahhh, why don't we do something else?	[]
Stan	6	1	Aw, dude, this looks like shit.	['shit']
Kyle	6	0	You don't wanna eat it?	[]
Stan	13	2	It just looks like shit to me, a bunch of processed, gooey shit.	['shit', 'shit']
Cartman	6	0	Look like ice cream to me.	[]
Kyle	11	0	Erm, okay, I know. How about we go to the mall?	[]
Stan	12	1	Ugh, bunch of people trying to sell us a bunch of shit.	['shit']
Kyle	8	0	Ugh, okay Stan, what do you wanna do?	[]
Stan	11	0	What, oh I don't care, I'm cool with whatever.	[]
Randy	14	0	City bog. Too much, too much city bop. Too much too much too much	[]
Farmer Friend 2	12	1	Lord, I ain't never seen britches take a whoopin' like that.	['britches']
Janitor/Farmer 1	10	1	I told you. Them britches don't stand a chance.	['britches']
Randy	74	0	City bop! City yeah!  Thank you! Thank you so much! I'd like to uh, bring up a special guest now.

Sharon	16	2	Who the hell is that woman, Randy?! What the hell do you think you're doing?!	['hell', 'hell']
Janitor/Farmer 1	11	1	I agree. Why don't you leave them poor britches alone?	['britches']
Farmer Friend 2	5	1	Them britches have had enough!	['britches']
Waitress	3	0	All alone today?	[]
Stan	11	0	Yeah it sucks. All my friends are sick with the flu.	[]
Waitress	6	0	Well, what can I get you?	[]
Stan	13	1	Do you have anything on the menu that doesn't taste like shit?	['shit']
Waitress	11	0	A little young to be so pessimistic, aren't ya kid?	[]
Stan	55	5	Why? There's nothing but shit on TV, video games are all shit, and the world's a big turd. The only thing that doesn't seem like total shit to me are my friends, and they're all sick. Just, get me a cheeseburger and tell the chef to go easy on the shit.	['shit', 'shit', 'turd', 'shit', 'shit']

Stan	8	0	You guys... don't wanna be around me?	[]
Kyle	13	0	Look dude, it's just one movie. We wanna have a good time.	[]
Stan	17	0	Please, Kyle, I can change my attitude. I promise. Let me go to the movies with you.	[]
Kyle	9	0	Okay. But you've gotta promise to not complain.	[]
Stan	6	0	I won't say a word.	[]
