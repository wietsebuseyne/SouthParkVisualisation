Reporter	82	0	Tom, I'm standing at the home in South Park where five precious little girls have been rescued from Romania. Their mother passes away some months ago, and then their grandmother died trying to bring them here. But all is well now, and people are coming from all over the country to view the little tykes.  If you'd like to come down and visit the quintuplets, admission is only $5, and for a few dollars more , you can feed them fishsticks.	[]
A Quint	1	0	Mmm.	[]
Reporter	21	0	Tom, it looks like these cute little girls have made it out of that armpit of a country they call Romania.	[]
Reporter	22	1	Yes, luckily for them, these quintuplets no longer have to live in Romania, the asshole of the world.  Back to you, Tom.	['asshole']
President	12	0	This is not good. It makes our country look poor and stupid.	[]
Romanian Official	5	0	This could kill our tourism.	[]
President	5	0	You know what to do.	[]
Instructor	10	0	Alright, Kenny, let's start with some warm-up exercises.	[]
Kenny	7	0	(Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha)	[]
Mrs.McCormick	13	0	Well, what do you think? Can you help him become a better singer?	[]
Instructor	13	0	Well, he's got potential. Depends on how good he wants to be.	[]
Kenny	5	0	(I wanna be really good)	[]
Instructor	22	0	Well, if you wanna be a real singer, you need to go to a conservatory in Europe. There's no other alternative.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Europe?)	[]
Mrs.McCormick	5	0	We can't afford that.	[]
Instructor	12	0	Well, then, I'm afraid your son will always be a hack.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Awww.)	[]
Mrs.McCormick	26	0	Well, Kenny, if it means that much to you, maybe we can bus it to Europe and... you can sing on the way to make money.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Yeah.)	[]
Sharon	9	0	Randy, Randy, you'd better have look at this.	[]
Randy	1	0	What?	[]
Anchor Tom	16	0	...until the U.S. government receives this video, which was sent from Romania just hours ago.	[]
Man	17	0	Hello. This is Romanian father. I am desperate to have my girls returned to me in Romania.	[]
Randy	2	0	Uh-oh.	[]
Stan	4	0	That's your dad?	[]
Quint 2	1	0	Maybe.	[]

Man	21	0	Baltania, eh anyway, my heart is aching for their return. I, I know the American government will do what's right.	[]
Kyle	19	0	Hoh no, dude. If they get sent back to Romania, we'll never get our Cirque dei Ceville going.	[]
Stan	11	0	Mom, Dad, you're not gonna send them back, are you??	[]
Sharon	9	0	Well, I... think we... have to,... don't we?	[]
Randy	4	0	I don't know.	[]
Kyle	14	1	You don't wanna go back to stinky Romania, do you? It sucks there.	['stinky']
Cartman	18	0	Yeah. America is sooo much cooler. In Romania they just oppress you and try to bring you down.	[]
Sharon	15	0	We'll have to call the police and see what they want us to do.	[]
Cartman	5	1	Damn, we might be screwed.	['damn']
Stan	20	1	No! We've just gotta convince these chicks that America kicks the ass out of every other country. Come on!	['ass']
Cartman	14	0	You see, in America we have... log rides!  Bacon double-cheeseburgers!  Sheep-shearing contests!	[]
A fan	4	0	Yeah. Woo hoohoohoo. Yeah.	[]

Mr. Vladchick	2	0	Okay.  Heh!	[]
Romanian Official	8	0	Our home is Romania. We love it there.	[]
Mr. Vladchick	7	0	Ah, yes, uwuh we love it there.	[]
Romanian Official	14	0	If daughters will not return on their own, you must force them to return	[]
Janet Reno	16	0	Gentlemen, this has to be handled very delicately. You don't understand Americans' power to protest.	[]
Romanian Official	1	0	Protest?	[]
Janet Reno	23	0	Look, people have it so good in America that they get bored very easily. And when people get bored they start protesting things.	[]
All three men	1	0	Oh.	[]
Janet Reno	27	0	But I want to assure you, and the Romanian people, that we are going to do everything in our power to make this as confusing as possible.	[]

Lead Agent Collins	28	0	Attention, people inside the house!  You must return the quintuplets to their father! You have until...  Oh yeah, that's good.  You have until Easter Sunday to comply.	[]
Protester	1	0	Nooo!	[]
Protesters	1	0	Boooo!	[]
Collins	1	0	What?!	[]
Stan	7	0	Okay, let's try it again. Hup!	[]
A Quint	1	0	Hup!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Alright!	[]
Randy	2	0	Stan, we-	[]
Sharon	17	0	Stanley, we have some bad news. The courts have decided the girls must go back to Romania.	[]
Stan	15	0	No, they can't! We've convinced them that they want to stay in America.	[]
Kyle	18	1	Yeah, we've shown them amusement parks and malls. How can you expect them to go back now??	['amusement']
Randy	23	0	I'm sorry, boys, but Janet Reno is having them taken away on Easter Sunday. We... don't have a choice. Sorry, girls.	[]
Stan	5	0	Now what do we do?	[]
Reporter	38	0	Tom, it is now Easter morning, and as the U.S. government promised, they are here to take the girls back to their father in Romania. Rumor has it that Janet Reno herself will be extraditing the quintuplets.	[]

Music Instructor	15	0	Lad, we would like very much to have you here at the Romanian Music School.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Woohoo!)	[]
Mrs. McCormick	7	0	How much is all this gonna cost?	[]
Music Instructor	26	1	Don't worry, Ms. McCormick, Romania is very poor country. Apartment is cheap. Food is cheap, Everything is cheap because we are so God-damned poor.	['damned']
Assistant	10	0	Yes, your two hundred American dollars will last months here.	[]
