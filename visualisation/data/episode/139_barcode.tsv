Stan	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Stan	8	1	Dad? Where the hell could he have gone??	['hell']
Randy	4	0	Oh hey, sorry boys.	[]
Male Voice	2	0	Later Randy.	[]
Randy	4	0	Hey, see you Nelson.	[]
Stan	5	0	Dad, weren't you watching?	[]
Randy	31	0	Well, I ran into Nelson from work. We were at the bar watching the game. Two-dollar margaritas! It was great. All right, come on, I'll drive you guys home.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Are you sure you're all right?	[]
Randy	15	0	Oh yeah, I'll be fine. I got some beers to keep my buzz going.	[]
Stan	11	0	Dad, aren't you supposed to like, not drink and drive?	[]
Randy	15	0	I'm not drinking and driving, I'm driving while I'm drinking. Right, boys?	[]
Stan	3	0	Sure, whatever dude.	[]
Randy	10	0	...Oh I gotta pee. Hand me that empty bottle, Stan.	[]
Stan	5	0	Why not just pull over?	[]
Randy	49	1	Stan, you need to learn some things about being a man! Now give me that bottle!  There's a  reason why God made our penises like little hoses, boys. Hold the wheel, Stan.  When you boys start driving, you're gonna need to learn to do this too. Woahp!	['penises']
Stan	5	0	Dad, we're gonna crash!	[]
Randy	9	1	Shh! Trying to concentrate!  Just hold the damn wheel!	['damn']
Kyle	7	0	Dude, I think you're being followed.	[]
Randy	7	2	Oh yeah?  Get off my ass, dickhole!	['ass', 'dickhole']
Kyle	6	0	No, dude, it's the police.	[]
Randy	5	1	Aww crap!  Here, hold this!	['crap']
Stan	5	0	Aww, it's all warm!	[]
Randy	15	0	Everybody just stay calm! I can handle this, no problem. I know how to deal.	[]
Officer	4	0	License and registration, please.	[]
Randy	7	0	What seems to be the officer, problem?	[]
Officer	12	0	...Sir, why don't you step out of the car for me?	[]
Randy	1	0	Okay.	[]
Officer	10	0	Sir, I'm going to give you a sobriety test.	[]
Randy	4	0	Okay, no problem. Easy.	[]
Officer	20	0	Stand over here, please?  Right there. All right, now I want you to hold your arms out at your sides...	[]
Randy	8	0	Ooof. There! I did it, see?! No problem!	[]
Officer	8	0	And now touch your finger to your nose.	[]
Randy	2	0	Do what??	[]
Officer	6	0	Touch your finger to your nose.	[]
Randy	6	0	Wull come on, that's impossible!	[]

Randy	9	0	What? What did I do?!  What did I do?!	[]
Officer 2	8	0	Keep blowing. Keep blowing.  Keep blowing.  Aw Jesus!	[]
Stan	4	0	This is sooo embarrassing.	[]
Cartman	10	0	You know, Stan, I'd say your dad racksa disciprine!	[]
Kyle	11	0	You know, I didn't even get home until 2:30.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Man, that was such a bummer.	[]
Stan	12	0	Look, guys, about last night, can you just be quiet about it?	[]
Cartman	1	0	Why?	[]
Stan	16	0	Because, I don't want everyone knowing, okay? Could we please just keep this to ourselves?	[]
Cartman	4	0	All right, Stan. Sure.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	49	0	Okay children, let's take our seats.  Today we will be continuing our study of economics. But first, we're going to hear from a motivational speaker. The state has sent over somebody to talk to you all about the dangers of drunk driving. Please welcome Stan's dad.	[]
Stan	2	0	Oh Jesus.	[]
Randy	39	0	Well uh, I'm, s'posed to tell you kids about how bad drinking is, um... I'd-did a little drinking and driving. As part of my punishment I'm... doing community service work at schools like these.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	9	0	Oh that's very interesting, isn't it, kids?	[]
Randy	55	0	Uh, you you shouldn't drink, because it leads to uh bad things. I was in jail for the night and well I guess I donno, I... Just don't drink but,... if you must drink, d-definitely don't drive. I've... definitely learned that firsthand, and uh, uuh, that's all, I guess.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	105	0	...Well, I think we've all learned an important lesson, haven't we, class? If you don't make the right choices in life, you could end up being a big loser like Stan's dad.  Drinking and driving is for idiots. Nobody wants to end up like Stan's dad, do they?  I want you all to take a good look at Stan's dad and say, Is that who I want to be in thirty years? Getting tickets and having to go to elementary school classrooms and talk about how pathetic I am? Thank you Mr. Marsh, I think you made your point.	[]
AA Speaker	12	0	Hello again everyone, my name is Michael, and, I'm an alcoholic.	[]
Group	2	0	Hi, Michael.	[]
Michael	41	0	As most of you know I once lost my job and my family because of my drinking. But with the help of AA I've been sober for ten years now.  Anyone have anything they wanna tell the groups, for starters?	[]
Man 1	8	0	My name's Bill, and Im an alcoholic.	[]
Group	2	0	Hi Bill.	[]
Randy	2	0	Hi Bill.	[]
Bill	37	0	I've been using the 12-step program for about two months now and, and I'm really turning my life around. No more blowing guys on Colfax Avenue for a pint of vodka for THIS cowboy!	[]
Michael	26	0	That's great. And I understand this is somebody's first AA meeting, is that right? </> Y-yes, you sir. Stand on up and introduce yourself.	[]
Randy	11	0	Um, my name's Randy, and... I just, really like beer.	[]
Man 2	8	0	You have to admit you're an alcoholic.	[]
Randy	11	0	But, I don't know if I'm really an alcoholic.	[]
Big Woman	5	0	Then why are you here?	[]
Randy	42	0	Because I got a DUI and so I'm required to attend AA meetings for two weeks. I was stupid one night and drank too much and then drove a car. That was dumb and I'm not gonna do it again.	[]
Michael	70	0	Randy, you are powerless to make that decision. The only thing that works is the 12-step program.  Step 1 is admitting that you are powerless to control your drinking. Only then can you move on to the other 12 steps, like, believing that only a higher power, God, makes you stop drinking. And then, turning your life over to that God and, humbly asking God to remove your weaknesses.	[]
Randy	15	0	What wait wait, hold on. I never knew that Alcoholics Anonymous was a religious thing.	[]
Michael	43	0	Well it's not religious. You just have to admit that there is some kind of god which has power over you and turn your life over to that god and ask him for forgiveness. That's the 12-step program, not religion.	[]
Randy	19	0	Look, I, I really just need to cut down on my drinking and never drive the car drunk again.	[]
Michael	19	0	You just can't cut down on your drinking, Randy. You need to know something. You have a disease.	[]
Randy	3	0	Uh... a disease?	[]
Michael	32	0	That's right. Alcoholism is a disease. You're sick, Randy. You're very very sick. And just like with most diseases, you can't cure it yourself. And it's deadly.	[]
Randy	3	0	Oh my God...	[]
Stan	7	1	Dad! What the hell are you doing?!	['hell']
Randy	2	0	Hello, Stan.	[]
Stan	19	0	Dad, it's the middle of the day! I thought you weren't going to drink as much anymore!	[]
Randy	14	0	No, Stan, you don't understand. I have a disease. Daddy's very sick.	[]
Stan	8	0	What?? Did you go to your AA meeting?!	[]
Randy	36	0	Yes, they're the ones that told me. I thought I could just quite drinking on my own, but... it's an illness, son. I have to admit that I'm powerless to this terrible disease.	[]
Stan	8	0	Dad, you've had enough! Just stop now!	[]
Randy	20	0	I can't! I'm sick!  It's not fair! Why did you give me this disease?!  Stan! Stan!  Stan.	[]
Stan	2	1	Aww, Goddammit!	['goddammit']
Randy	5	0	Stan I... need your help.	[]
Stan	10	0	Dad, what are you doing in Grandpa's extra wheelchair?!	[]
Randy	16	0	Gotta try to take it easy from now on, son. Get Daddy another beer, will ya?	[]
Stan	7	0	No! You don't need another beer!	[]
Randy	15	0	I know that! But this disease is just eating me up! I hate my illness!	[]
Stan	13	0	Dad, you just need to not drink so much. It's very simple.	[]
Randy	40	0	I wish it was that simple, son. But if I don't give myself up to a higher power, this disease is going to kill me dead. I'm afraid the only thing that will cure me... is a miracle.	[]
Priest	6	0	Es un milagro.   Es un milagro!	[]
Field Reporter	77	2	Tom, I'm standing in the garden of St. Peter's church in Bailey, where what some call a miracle is taking place. The statue of the Virgin Mary has started to bleed. Out its ass.  The phenomenon was first seen by Father Harold Barnes,  who saw the blood coming from the Virgin Mary's ass late last night.  People from all over the state have flocked here to the church to witness the apparent miracle firsthand.	['ass', 'ass']
Woman 1	21	0	Well, we just heard that this miracle was happening and we wanted to see it for ourselves and come and pray.	[]
Field Reporter	10	0	Why do you believe the Virgin Mary is dripping blood?	[]
Woman 2	16	0	Well it may represent her sorrow over all the bad things going on in the world.	[]
Field Reporter	39	1	Why do you believe the Virgin Mary is dripping blood out her ass?  As news of the miracle spreads, hundreds are expected to show up here at the church, hoping to witness the miracle, and even cure their diseases.	['ass']
Randy	4	0	Cure... cure disease. STAN!!	[]
Man 3	9	0	My name is Harry and I'm an alcoholic.	[]
Group	2	0	Hi Harry.	[]
Harry	35	0	I've been sober now for five years and I I've learned that drinking ice tea and, and getting more involved with my relationship with God is, is, is way more fun than partying.	[]
Woman 2	4	0	It it sure is.	[]
Harry	33	0	Once I accepted that I was powerless to control my drinking and my life, I I put it in God's hands and now, these meeting are the most fun thing I do.	[]
Man 4	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Stan	8	0	Ah, excuse me, who's in charge here?	[]
Michael	10	0	None of us are in charge. We're all powerless.	[]
Group	8	0	We sure are. That's right. Uh huh.	[]
Stan	22	0	Uh, look, my dad was here yesterday and ...you all kind of messed him up by telling him he had a disease?	[]
Harry	4	0	Alcoholism is a disease.	[]
Stan	29	0	No it, it's not. And, y-you can't just go around saying stuff like that to people like my dad. He He's kind of, a hypochondriac	[]
Man 2	15	0	It is a disease because it's a physical dependency. That makes it a disease.	[]
Stan	11	0	No, cancer is a disease. My dad needs to drink less.	[]
Michael	15	0	He can't quit by himself. None of us could. He needs divine intervention. Spirituality.	[]
Stan	25	0	No, he just needs a disciprine. But thanks to you people, my dad now thinks he has a disease that he can't cure himself.	[]
Michael	11	0	Young man, do you know anything about the 12-Step Program?	[]
Stan	21	1	Yeah, and I also know a thing or two about cults. I was the leader of one for a while.  Goddammit!	['goddammit']
Field Reporter	40	1	The crowd grows larger every hour, as the statue of the Virgin Mary continues to miraculously cry blood... out her ass. A Cardinal, Mallory, has been sent by the Vatican to determine whether this is a true miracle or not.	['ass']
Father Barnes	18	0	Right this way, Cardinal.  The blood always comes from the same area. Sometimes a little, sometimes a lot.	[]
Cardinal Mallory	4	0	It's a miracle!	[]
Randy	5	0	Uh, kay, here we go.	[]
Stan	6	0	Dad?! Dad, what are you doing?!	[]
Randy	5	0	I gotta drive to Bailey.	[]
Stan	10	0	Dad, you're drunk! You're not driving a car!	[]
Randy	23	1	No, Stan, you don't understand. There's a church in Bailey. The statue of the Virgin Mary is bleeding out her ass.	['ass']
Stan	1	0	What??	[]
Randy	20	1	They say her divine ass blood has miraculous healing power. She can cure my alcoholism! I'll be back soon!	['ass']
Stan	25	0	Dad, you can't drive! Your license is suspended, remember?! If you get pulled over again, you're gonna go to jail for ten years!	[]
Randy	4	0	Alright... then you drive.	[]
Stan	3	0	... I'm eight!	[]
Randy	14	0	This is my only hope, Stan! Either you drive this car or I will!	[]
Randy	37	0	I sure hope this works. No. No, it will work! I have to put my faith in a higher power. I HAVE to believe that this will work!  There! There's the church! Stop right here, Stan!	[]
Stan	5	0	Where? I can't see.	[]
Randy	16	0	Right here is good! Brake pedal! Left pedal!  Alright, get my wheelchair out of the back.	[]
Randy	15	0	Is this the line?  Oh God!  Is this whole line people waiting to be cured?	[]
Man 5	18	0	Yeah. I was diagnosed with brain cancer two months ago. I feel like this is my only hope.	[]
Randy	10	0	I know exactly how you feel. I've got alcoholism.	[]
Stan	3	0	Oh my God...	[]
Randy	25	0	Wait a minute. Stan, isn't that Josh Garrett up there? He's from South Park. Maybe he'll let us in line with him.	[]
Stan	7	0	Dad, let's just wait our turn.	[]
Randy	20	0	I could die waiting in this line, Stan. Come on, let's go!  Heeey heh, Josh Garrett. How you doin'?	[]
Josh	7	0	Oh, hey Randy. What happened to you??	[]
Randy	11	0	I've got a disease: Alcoholism. It's pretty serious. You?	[]
Josh	5	0	Mm-my  daughter has elephantitis	[]
Randy	7	0	We are the same, she and I.	[]
Man 6	9	0	Eey, what do you think you're doin', kid?	[]
Old Woman	7	0	You're trying to cut in line!	[]
Stan	5	0	I just, my dad was-	[]
Man 7	10	0	You're a butter! You're a dirty line cutter!	[]
Old Woman 2	2	0	Praise Jesus.	[]
Randy	13	0	This is taking too long! I'm gonna run out of beer! Stan!	[]
Stan	1	0	What?!	[]
Randy	36	0	You see that guy up there? I think he has a kidney disease. Every couple of minutes he gets out of line to go to the bathroom. When he leaves next, let's take his place.	[]
Stan	5	0	No, Dad, people will see!	[]
Randy	16	0	The guy behind him is blind! There he goes! C'mon! C'mon! Go go go!	[]
Blind Man	5	0	Hey. I smell a butter.	[]
Woman 3	8	0	He did, that kid just cut in line!	[]
Man 8	5	0	Back o'the line, butter!	[]
Randy	5	0	I'm going to die!	[]
Stan	5	0	Dad, we're going back!	[]
Officer	5	0	What's goin' on here?	[]
Man 9	6	0	This kid's cutting in line!	[]
Randy	25	0	Please, officer, you have to understand. I need a miracle way more than these people. I'm an alcoholic, and I'm powerless over it.	[]
Officer	19	0	...I understand. My, my brother's an alcoholic. Here, let me push you to the front of the line.	[]
Randy	55	0	Oh bless you, sir! Bless you!  'Scuse me, out of the way, alcoholic coming through!  She's... beautiful.  Aaaah. AAAAAaaaaah!  I'm... not... going... to drink this. I'm not going to drink this!  It's a miracle! I'm cured!  Yoohoohoo! Praise Jesus! Praise Mary the Blessed Virgin Mother! Thank you! Thank you God!	[]
Randy	30	0	Good morning, family. The Lord has truly blessed us with another beautiful day.  It's just amazing. I haven't had a drink in five days. Praise Christ. Praise him.	[]
Stan	2	0	Praise Christ.	[]
Shelly	2	0	Praise Christ.	[]
Randy	26	0	I've got another AA meeting today and guess where it's gonna be, Stan. At Whistlin' Willy's Pizza, so you can come with me.	[]
Stan	26	0	Naw, Dad, all the guys are going to Kyle's hosue to watch the Bronco game. Kenny and Kyle's Dads were hoping you'd come.	[]
Randy	19	0	Stan, those people drink. I have new friends now. My AA friends, who have faith in a higher power.	[]
Group	4	0	Yeah, all right, woohoo!	[]
Randy	13	0	Boy this lemonade is great! Who knew how fun being sober could be?!	[]
Group	5	0	Yeah! That's right! Right!	[]
Boy	6	0	Your dad doesn't drink either?	[]
Stan	6	0	No, my dad doesn't drink.	[]
Boy	6	0	Does that mean we're friends?	[]
Randy	13	0	'Scuse me, I-I'd like to address the group if I may.	[]
Michael	4	0	Sure Randy, go ahead.	[]
Randy	8	0	I'm Randy and I'm an alcoholic.	[]
Group	2	0	Hi Randy.	[]
Randy	20	0	But I put my faith in a higher power and... I haven't had a drink for five days now!	[]
Field Reporter	8	0	An update from the bleeding Virgin Mary statue!	[]
Randy	9	0	Oh wait. Sh sh. Hold on a second, gang.	[]
Field Reporter	39	0	Earlier today, the new pope, Pope Benedict the 16th himself, visited the statue here in Bailey to witness the miracle firsthand.  It was an amazing sight to behold as Pope Benedict made his way through the throngs of people.	[]
Cardinal Mallory	5	0	Right this way, Your Holiness.	[]
Field Reporter	31	0	The pope then examined the statue closely.  After witnessing the phenomenon firsthand, the pope then cleaned himself off and then declared that the bleeding Virgin Mary statue is not a miracle!	[]
Randy	1	0	What?	[]
Field Reporter	50	4	Having investigated closely, the pope determined that the blood was not coming from the Virgin Mary's ass, but rather, from her vagina. And the pope said quote, A chick bleeding out her vagina is no miracle. Chicks bleed out their vagina's all the time.  Back to you, Tom.	['ass', 'vagina', 'vagina', 'vagina']
Tom	8	0	Thanks, Edward, that's a very shocking report...	[]
Randy	39	0	That means... I'm not cured. I still have the disease!  Bartender! I need a drink! Three shots of McAllen, two small bottles of vodka, three bottles of beer and some Jell-O shooters!  Come ON! Let's GO!	[]
Michael	6	0	Randy, uh what are you doing?	[]
Randy	16	0	You heard what he said!  The higher power didn't cure me! I'm powerless again!	[]
Man 10	8	0	I'm, I'm, I'm powerless too!	[]
Man 11	3	0	Yeah me too!	[]
Man 10	4	0	Get me seven martinis!	[]
Man 12	3	0	Jack and Coke!	[]
Stan	3	0	Dad, Dad, Stop!	[]
Randy	9	0	I'm sorry, son! I'm off the wagon!	[]
Stan	20	0	Dad, you don't have to do this! You have the power. You haven't drank since seeing the statue.	[]
Randy	7	0	But the statue wasn't a miracle!	[]
Stan	29	0	Yeah. The statue wasn't a miracle, Dad. So that means you did it. That means you didn't have a drink for five days all on your own.	[]
Randy	25	0	You're right, Stan. If God didn't make me stop drinking then... I did. Maybe... Maybe I can force myself to never drink again.	[]
Stan	1	0	No!	[]
Randy	1	0	No??	[]
Stan	44	0	Dad, you like to drink. So have a drink once in a while. Have two. If you devote your whole life to completely avoiding something you like, then that thing still controls your life and, 'n you've never learned any discipline at all.	[]
Randy	17	0	But, maybe... I'm just the kind of person who needs to have it all or nothing.	[]
Stan	21	0	Naw. All or nothing is easy. But learning to drink a little bit, responsibly, that'sa disciprine. Disciprine... come from within.	[]
Randy	10	0	How did I manage to raise such a smart kid?	[]
Stan	6	0	I've had a great teacher.	[]
Randy	2	0	Thanks son.	[]
Stan	10	0	No not you, my karate teacher. He's really smart.	[]
Randy	24	0	Oh. Well, tell you what: let's leave the car here, walk home, and watch the game. Like to have another beer or two.	[]
Stan	2	0	All right!	[]
Randy	9	0	Come on!  Or maybe I'll have three beers.	[]
Stan	9	0	That's probably okay if you spread it out.	[]
Randy	4	0	Well how about four?	[]
Stan	6	0	I think you're pushing it.	[]
Randy	3	0	How about twenty?	[]
Stan	4	0	That's not disciprine.	[]
Randy	5	0	Right right. Does vodka count?	[]
Stan	1	0	Dad!	[]
