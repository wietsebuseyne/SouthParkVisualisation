Girl 2	7	0	What's wrong with supporting girls athletics?!	[]
Cartman	22	0	Dude, girls should totally be allowed to play sports, you just can't expect people to want to watch. Okay?  All right.	[]
Girl 3	18	0	You know, we're actually in the playoffs, and all we keep hearing is We're too busy.	[]
Kyle	10	0	But we actually are busy. Tonight's the big fight.	[]
Girl 3	2	0	What fight?	[]
Stan	21	0	Dude, Kenny is fighting Slaughterhouse tonight. I mean, no offense, but, we're not gonna miss the fight for... girls volleyball.	[]
Cartman	17	1	Yeah so, sorry you're not getting any spectators, but there's hardcore dude shit to watch.	['shit']
Player	25	0	Alright, I'm going to play a fifth mana card... and then I'm going to attack with my elderbeast- hold on. Wait. Hold on.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Can Kenny block his elderbeast?	[]
Stan	7	0	Not with his Shapeshifter. It already attacked.	[]
Cartman	8	1	This asshole needs to make a move already!	['asshole']
Referee	6	0	Quiet in the peanut gallery, please.	[]
Player	18	0	I am attacking, but with a newly summoned spark ghast who has trample. Four damage to your planeswalker.	[]
Boys	1	0	Ohhhh!	[]
Butters	3	0	Oh no! Kenny!	[]
Stan	1	0	Shhh!	[]
Butters	4	0	But he's dying!	[]

Boys	1	0	Yeeahhh!	[]
Player	1	0	Nnoohhh!	[]
Cartman	5	0	Dude, it was complete brutality!	[]
Kyle	7	0	You've never seen anything so ruthless!	[]
Stan	7	0	It was seriously almost hard to watch.	[]
Cartman	21	0	At one point, Kenny actually polymorphed the dude into a blue frog with an instant attack card. It was carnage, bro!	[]
Stan	7	0	Wendy, did you hear about last night?	[]
Wendy	12	0	Yeah, I heard the girls volleyball team won by like 20 points.	[]
Stan	8	0	Not that. Did you actually go to that?	[]
Wendy	8	0	Yeah. You should show your support too sometime.	[]
Stan	2	0	Pfft whatever.	[]
Cartman	17	0	Dude, I don't think people are appreciating this!  It was such pwnage it was almost repulsive!	[]
Janitor	12	0	Hey! Pssst!  Come over here.  You guys like hard-core stuff, huh?	[]
Cartman	10	1	Yeah we like hardcore stuff, we're fuckin' dudes, bro.	['fuckin']
Janitor	31	1	Yeah well, you boys wanna get in on some real action? If you like excitement. I'm not talkin' about the little boys stuff. I'm talkin' about real man shit.	['shit']
Stan	3	0	We're men.	[]
Janitor	30	0	Well then, if you wanna see REAL fights with REAL brutality, go here.  This is the underground stuff, so keep it quiet.  And you might wanna pack a barf bag.	[]

Mr. Tuong	12	0	You go down! Go down, find seat! We in sixth fight! Gogogogogogogo!	[]
Announcer	22	0	Scrambles plays a Black Swamp mana card. Fluffy counters with a mana card of his own. And he plays a fugitive wizard!	[]
Crowd	1	0	Ooooooo.	[]
Announcer	57	0	More mana from Scrambles! And yes, that is Crippling Blight! Crippling Blight to the fugitive wizard! Creature now has -1 to strength and defense! More Mana from Fluffy. Now he'll attack with fugitive wizard, and there's an instant attack from Scrambles! That is peel from reality! Fugitive wizard is literally torn apart from the battleground!	[]
The boys	1	0	Whoa!	[]
Announcer	19	0	The mana is flying now as both roosters play sorcery spells! It's Mass Calcify against Into the Void!	[]
Cartman	5	0	Dude, that was total carnage!	[]
Stan	4	0	That was freakin' hardcore.	[]
Cartman	14	0	Can you believe that rooster played a Kalonian Twingrove with half his mana tapped?	[]
Stan	4	0	It was just decimation.	[]
Kyle	17	0	It was really about the most man thing I think we've ever been a part of.	[]
Cartman	7	0	We're going again on Friday, right?	[]
Stan	2	1	Hell yeah!	['hell']
Cartman	5	0	What's the matter Kenny?	[]
Kenny	10	0	(I don't know. It just seems kind of... mean)	[]
Stan	5	0	What's mean about it?	[]
Cartman	6	0	You feel bad for the roosters?	[]
Kenny	7	0	(Yeah, I feel bad for the roosters.)	[]
Stan	20	0	Look, who's to say the roosters don't wanna play? I mean, they were goin' at it pretty hard.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Yeah, maybe that just kind of what they do naturally.	[]
Cartman	23	0	Guys, I think maybe Kenny's a little hurt because he was the big Magic champion, and now chickens are stealing his thunder.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(No.)	[]
Cartman	4	0	Huh? A little bit?	[]
Kenny	1	0	(NO.)	[]
Stan	15	0	Dude, you know what we should do? We should all go in on a rooster.	[]
Kyle	13	1	Dude, totally. With Kenny's Magic skills, we could probably kick serious ass!	['ass']
Cartman	30	0	What do you think Kenny? Would that make you feel better? Huh? Come on, where's that smile? Where's that smile, Kenny? I think he's smiling you guys.	[]
Det. Harris	7	0	Hello, Mr. McCormick. Surprised to see us?	[]
Stuart	4	0	What do you mean?	[]
Det. Harris	27	2	Let's cut the crap, huh? We know there's an illegal cock Magic ring going on in town, we just wanna know who's leading it.	['crap', 'cock']
Stuart	4	1	What's cock Magic?	['cock']
Det. Harris	72	2	Right. Roosters are being forced against their will to play Magic: the Gathering, and you know nothing about it because you're 'white'. Let's git something straight: cock Magic isn't an Asian thing or a Mexican thing. White people do it too, if they're poor enough. You got a junked car in your front yard, Mr. McCormick. Care to tell us where the cock Magic fights are being held?	['cock', 'cock']
Stuart	9	1	I don't go to any cock Magic fights!	['cock']
Det. Harris	61	0	Do you have any sympathy at all for the animals, Mr. McCormick? Can you imagine being kept in a small cage, barely able to turn around, and then finally let out only to be blasted by Arctic ice spells and legendary creature cards? It's illegal, and it's wrong. And anyone I find involved with this filth is going down!	[]
Randy	17	0	Now I don't wanna lecture anybody, but what you boys are getting involved in is dangerous!	[]
Stan	8	0	Dad, it's not that big a deal.	[]
Randy	22	1	It is a big deal, okay?! People can get hurt! Believe it or not I was into Cock Magic back in college.	['cock']
Kyle	2	0	You were?	[]
Randy	29	0	Yes, so I'm not some fuddy-duddy who doesn't get it! I just wanna make sure if you boys do it, you do it right, and safely.	[]
Stan	9	1	Dad, that's not, that's not cock Magic.	['cock']
Randy	6	0	Oh? Not impressed? How about this?	[]
Voice	3	0	What is it?!	[]
Cartman	14	0	Hello? We're looking to buy a rooster that can play Magic: The Gathering?	[]
Voice	7	1	Never heard of cock Magic, or roosters.	['cock']
Kyle	7	0	Uhhh, we aren't cops or anything.	[]
Breeder	30	0	Come on to the back, don't mind the smell.  We only deal in the highest quality poultry planeswalkers. Are you looking for a New Hampshire or a Cornish breed?	[]
Kyle	7	0	We don't... really know the difference.	[]
Breeder	52	0	Well, your New Hampshire broiler chickens are the best for white mana. These here have been raised to play mostly protection spells and do well with sorcery cards. And here you got your green mana necromancers. Lots of earthy growth and hindering incantations that are good against blue- or black-stacked decks.	[]
Stan	6	0	Do you think they're happy?	[]
Breeder	6	0	Do I think they're happy?	[]
Stan	14	0	Yeah, like, do you think they mind being made to play Magic: The Gathering?	[]
Breeder	4	1	They're fuckin' chickens.	['fuckin']
Cartman	16	0	Well, our friend here has some animal-rights concerns. Do you have any free-range chickens?	[]
Breeder	17	0	Free-range chickens are primarily control deck players that slow the game down with board control cards.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Aw, screw the free-range chickens, huh Kenny?	[]
Stan	6	0	Hey, how about this little guy?	[]
Breeder	16	0	That one's kind of young. I don't even know what kinda cards he prefers.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Then he's perfect for us.	[]
Cartman	11	0	What should we name him, Kenny? I know. How about McNuggets?	[]
Kyle	8	0	Hey McNuggets. You wanna come play for us?	[]
Cartman	12	0	Yes I do, you guys.  Oh wow, did you hear him, Kenny?	[]
Shelley	19	0	Mom, will you tell Dad to get out of the bathroom?! He's been in there for an hour!	[]
Sharon	1	0	Randy?	[]
Randy	5	0	Hey! Oh! Oh thank you!	[]
Sharon	5	0	Randy, what are you doing?!	[]
Randy	14	0	Oh! Nothing, Sharon. Just going to the bathroom, if you don't mind.  Hey!	[]
Sharon	6	0	Randy, why are there drums playing?	[]
Randy	12	1	All right, Sharon. I'm practicing. Cock magic is making a comeback.	['cock']
Sharon	5	0	Ohhh, no no nononononono no.	[]
Randy	34	0	Oh yehhs yesyseyseyesyseyse Sharon, I don't know why or how, but people all over town are talking about it again. Now you know that I was one of the best back in college.	[]
Sharon	11	0	I know that's why you got kicked out of college.	[]
Randy	27	1	Because people didn't understand! People were afraid, Sharon! But now culture has caught up. And even our son is discovering what cock magic has to offer.	['cock']
Sharon	1	0	Stanley??	[]
Randy	27	0	People are going to do it, Sharon. And it's up to the professionals to make sure it's handled the right way. Hoh!  Oh my gosh!	[]
Announcer	23	0	Reuben casts Silklash Spider. Silklash Spider can block as if it had Flying! And now he casts Geistflame, dealing one damage to McNuggets.	[]
Cartmen	4	0	Come on, McNuggets! Fight!	[]
Kyle	5	0	You can do it, McNuggets!	[]
Announcer	2	0	Quite please.	[]
Someone	9	0	I think I'll bet on the next one.	[]
Announcer	21	0	Waaiitt!  McNuggets has cast Punishing Fire, absorbing the Geistflame and dealing two damage to the opponent! Game, set and match, McNuggets!	[]
Crowd	1	0	Whoa!	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Cartman	3	0	All right McNuggets!	[]
Kyle	11	0	All right McNuggets!  Did we pick the right rooster or what?!	[]
Cartman	22	2	That was goddamned manly! I mean, no offense to Kenny, but that shit made regular Magic: The Gathering look like girls volleyball.	['goddamned', 'shit']
Promoter	14	1	Excuse me. That was pretty impressive down there. You boys have a nice cock.	['cock']
Cartman	5	0	Thank you so very much.	[]
Promoter	25	0	I've never seen a rooster throw down spells with such raw brutality. How would you like to move him up to the big time?	[]
Kyle	7	0	You mean there's more to this?	[]
Promoter	45	3	Oh yes. And I'm not talking about the basement of some seedy Chinese restaurant, I'm talking about the basement of a well-established Chinese franchise. Saturday night, here's the address.  Let's see what kind of money your cock can really make.	['basement', 'basement', 'cock']
Stan	2	0	Gee, thanks!	[]
Cartman	11	0	You hear that, McNuggets? You're goin' to the big leagues!	[]
Woman	17	0	Okay kids, it's time for our birthday show. Everyone, let's be quiet now. Come on.	[]
Kindergarten boy	5	0	Yay, a show, a show!	[]
Woman	5	0	Do you kids like magic?	[]
Kindergartners	2	0	Yeah, yay!	[]
Woman	12	0	Okay, well let's all give a cheer for the Amazingly Randi!	[]
Randy	16	0	Hey kids, are we having fun?  Oh where'd my hat go?! Anyone see my hat?	[]
Woman	11	0	Okay, the magician has started. Let's get the cake ready.	[]
Randy	30	0	Now, some of you might think that this is a little crazy, but if you believe in magic...  you'll find that-  Ow! Ow! Oh God! Can somebody help, please!	[]
Man	9	0	They're getting a kick out the magician, huh?	[]
Randy	43	0	Won't somebody help me out?! Get someone- You, little girl! Can you please just, just check behind your ear?!  Oh, it was behind her ear.  And there we go and we're all better and I am the Amazingly Randi! Thank you!	[]
Kindergarten boy	3	0	I hate you!	[]
Stan	23	2	Dude, it was so badass! Our guy slaughtered every other fighter there. And now he's moving up to the real hardcore shit.	['badass', 'shit']
Kyle	10	0	It was seriously about the greatest night of our lives.	[]
Craig	4	0	Where was all this?	[]
Cartman	12	1	We can't tell you, bro. It's like, hardcore underground shit.	['shit']
Kyle	5	0	Yeah, you gotta know people.	[]
Butters	6	0	Dangit, I wish I knew people.	[]
Mr. Garrison	24	0	All right kids, before we get started, the coach of the girls volleyball team is here and would like to say a few words.	[]
Coach	32	0	Thank you, Mr. Garrison. Listen uh, last night we had a pretty big game against Evergreen. The girls really hammered 'em, but once again we're a... little disappointed in the turnout.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Oh Jesus, give it a rest already.	[]
Butters	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Coach	36	0	You know, when you put your all into something, it's kind of a bummer when people don't seem to care.  Kind of makes you feel like the sport you love is becoming a joke.	[]
Stan	13	0	Dude, girls volleyball isn't a joke. Jokes are hard and require skill.	[]
Cartman	1	0	OOHHH!!	[]
Jimmy	5	0	Fantastic girls volleyball joke, Stan.	[]
Coach	24	0	The girls wanted to say something, so we're now going to hear a few words from the captain of the girls volleyball team.	[]
Wendy	25	0	Hey guys, these games coming up are really big and it would mean a lot to us if you could try and make it. Thanks.	[]
Cartman	15	0	Dude, Wendy plays volleyball. Did you know that? I don't think you knew that.	[]
Man	43	2	And then he uh, took his penis from behind our daughter's ear and uh, we uh, uh that's when we saw him with uh, the n-the three rings. and uh, his penis, he was pulling it through 'em somehow, uh.	['penis', 'penis']
Det. Harris	11	1	Uh huh. And what about the cock Magic? Where was that?	['cock']
Man	30	1	Well that's what I'm telling you. It was right here exce-except for the thing where he poured the milk into his penis; he did that over there.	['penis']
Det. Harris	12	0	Alright alright, let's focus. What kind of decks were they using?	[]
Woman	1	0	Decks??	[]
Man	6	0	Who? There weren't any decks.	[]
Det. Harris	20	1	Oh, I get it now. Do you know what the penalty is for calling in a false cock Magic report?	['cock']
Woman	5	0	I'm so confused, babe.	[]
Det. Harris	18	0	Who paid you to call us and take our focus away from the investigation?! What color were they?!	[]
Man	19	0	Nobody paid us anything! Now, there has been a crime here and you'd better do something about it!	[]
Det. Harris	5	0	Agreed! Who first called 911?	[]
Woman	9	0	Please! Don't take me away from my child!	[]
Girl	1	0	Mommy!	[]
Kyle	7	0	This is it. 1421 Plaza de Estereotipo.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Wow. Here we are, McNuggets. You're reached the big time.	[]
Manager	7	0	Sorry, Panda Express is crosed. We crosed!	[]
Cartman	11	1	Yeah yeah yeah yeah, we're here for the cock Magic.	['cock']

Cartman	2	0	Ten darra?!	[]
Announcer 2	12	0	For the next round, it is Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds, versus Clucky	[]
Cartman	3	0	Who is that??	[]
Spectator 1	20	1	That's Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds.  He's never lost a fight. Hell, he's never even lost one health!	['hell']
Stan	13	0	What do you mean? Is he a red mage or a green mage?	[]
Cartman	18	0	Dude, he's like a beast! He's got more legendary creature cards than I've ever seen!	[]
Kyle	8	0	McNuggets is scared. He doesn't wanna play.	[]
Cartman	4	0	McNuggets is scared, dude!	[]
Stan	16	0	Can you stack his deck with more mana?! Can you stack McNuggets' deck with more mana?!	[]
Spectator 2	22	0	He didn't stand a chance. Not one spell cast before he was obliterated by health drains! That thing isn't human!	[]
Promoter	7	0	Alright, your rooster's up next, boys.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Aw I don't think he wants to play, dude.	[]
Promoter	6	0	He doesn't have a choice	[]
Cartman	11	0	This isn't even a fight. This is just... a slaughter.	[]
Promoter	11	0	What do you think all these people are here to see?	[]
Cartman	8	1	Holy shit dude! Dude, we forfeit! We forfeit!	['shit']
Promoter	9	2	The hell you do! Get your cock in there!	['hell', 'cock']
ESPN Announcer	13	1	You're watching ESPN Illegal. Your source for bullfighting, dogfighting, and cock Magic.	['cock']
ESPN Host	92	3	And a warm welcome back to the Cock Magic Championships. Certainly an electric atmosphere here in the basement of Panda Express. The fight we were expecting, of course, Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds versus ten-month-old Cornish rooster McNuggets. In a complete shocker, the challenger McNuggets has been scratched and substituting for him is nine-year-old Kenny McCormick. Never a dull moment in the illegal sport of cock Magic. Let's rejoin the battle now as we wait for Gadnuk's sixth move.  Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds plays a creature card.	['cock', 'basement', 'cock']
Cartman	16	0	Jesus, Paragon of Fierce Defiance. Now every red creature Gadnuk plays will have a +1 attack.	[]
Crowd	1	0	Whooaa.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Come on, Kenny!	[]
Stan	10	0	What did he play? Did he tap all his mana?	[]
Cartman	21	0	Dude, he just cast Psychogenic Probe. Now every time the other rooster has to shuffle his deck, he loses two health.	[]
Kyle	6	0	He just had to shuffle it.	[]
Cartman	24	0	Did you hear that? He's shuffling his deck already. The only thing he's got on the battle ground now is an overseer.	[]
Stan	10	0	Does an overseer have trample? DOES AN OVERSEER HAVE TRAMPLE?!	[]
ESPN Host	37	0	A second Elvish Mystic now, and Gadnuk attacks with Merciful Pretender. McCormick sends Charging Rhino to the graveyard. He's desperate now. Not too much he can-OH! And he's just laid down Life's Legacy!	[]
Crowd	1	0	Ooooohh...	[]
ESPN Host	20	0	That was not expected! Gadnuk doesn't know what hit him! McCormick follows with Crackling Doom and Abzan Battle Priest!	[]
Kyle	3	1	Holy shit, dude!	['shit']
ESPN Host	46	0	Gadnuk tries to block with Living Totem but OH, there is Terra Stomper! This is absolute savagery! Frenzied Goblin has been sent to the graveyard and now there is no one to block Pearl Lake Ancient! My God, someone has to put a stop to this!	[]
Det. Harris	24	1	Freeze!  Well, well! Looks like I finally caught the big boys! You're all going to jail for a long time!  Especially you, scumbag!	['scumbag']
Promoter	7	0	Lousy cops! How did you find us?	[]
Det. Harris	11	1	We saw your fliers.  Panda Express. Cock Magic at 9 pm.	['cock']
Promoter	7	0	We didn't put those fliers out!	[]
Announcer	15	0	And now, for your halftime entertainment, please welcome... the incomparable, the beautiful, the Amazingly Randi!	[]
Cartman	6	0	Ah, dude, your dad's here.	[]
Randy	44	0	Thank you, hey! You know, we live in a world of brutality and violence. And some people think there's no room for wonder anymore. But just for a moment I want you to think one thing.  Whatever you believe is real, is real.	[]
Head	7	0	Come on Barbie, let's go party.	[]
Spectator 3	1	0	Ewww!	[]
Randy	12	0	Alright, for this last bit I'm gonna need a volunteer. Anybody?	[]
Det. Harris	3	0	I'll volunteer.	[]
Randy	9	0	Alright, come on up here.  What's your name?	[]
Det. Harris	7	0	I'm Detective Harris, South Park Police.	[]
Randy	32	1	All right, a hand for Detective Harris!  You know, if there's one thing I could leave you all with, it's this. Let cock magic be done by the professionals.  Sir?	['cock']
Cartman	31	1	It was so hardcore you guys. Kenny laid waste to Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds. It got so out of hands that the fucking cops had to come and break it up.	['fucking']
Butters	4	0	Wow, the cops came?	[]
Kyle	12	0	Yeah, It was seriously the most manly thing that's ever happened.	[]
Cartman	29	1	Kenny cast Glacial Crasher, and then Stan's dad shot his dick off. I just, I seriously don't know where we go from here. You all right, Kenny?	['dick']
Kenny	8	0	(Yeah, I guess. I just wonder about McNuggets.)	[]
Kyle	12	0	Hey yeah, what about poor McNuggets? What's he gonna do now?	[]
Stan	9	0	Wait a minute. I've got it, you guys.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Got what?	[]
Stan	10	0	A way to finally do something good for other people.	[]
Announcer	36	0	South Park serves, and McNuggets plays a Plains Land card. One-nill, South Park.  Another serve, and McNuggets summons Downtreader Elk. One south Park player is eliminated. You, the girl with the ponytails - you are dead.	[]
