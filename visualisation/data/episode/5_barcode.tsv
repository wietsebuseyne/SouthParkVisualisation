Cartman	9	0	Hey Stan, where'd you get that black eye?	[]
Stan	6	0	Nothing, I mu-I mean, nowhere.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Your sister beat you up again, huh?	[]
Stan	1	0	No!	[]
Cartman	9	1	Eheh, you know, heh, your sister kicked your ass.	['ass']
Stan	19	0	She's just pissed off 'cause she got headgear at the dentist.  She's taking it out on me.	[]
Kyle	13	1	Yeah, but that sucks, to get your butt kicked by a girl, Stan.	['butt']
Cartman	32	3	I would never let a woman kick my ass.  If she tried anything, I'd be like, hey, you get your bitch ass back in the kitchen, and make me some pie!	['ass', 'bitch', 'ass']
Stan	28	1	My parents don't even believe that she beats me up.  They think she's all innocent and sweet, but I know that she's an evil bitch!	['bitch']
Cartman	16	0	Be a man Stan.  Just say, Hey woman, ye-you shut your mouth and make babies.	[]
Stan	7	0	Hey Kyle, what's that elephant doing?	[]
Kyle	4	0	You mean this one?	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Kyle	6	0	He's my new pet elephant.	[]
Stan	9	0	Whoa dude!  Where'd you get a pet elephant?	[]
Kyle	22	0	I got it mail ordered from Africa.  The ad said it would take 4 to 6 weeks, but it only took three.	[]
Stan	4	0	Wow, that's cool!	[]
Kyle	31	1	No it's not cool!  My mom won't let me keep him in the house.  She says he's too big, and that his poop is bigger than our couch.	['poop']
Cartman	16	1	That's why my mom got me a pot-bellied pig.  Cause its poop is small.	['poop']
Kenny	17	0	(Hey you guys, I talked to Garrison and he told me that they're almost the same.)	[]
Stan	9	0	Well yeah, but pigs aren't smart, like elephants.	[]
Ms. Crabtree	8	0	Hey.  Wait a minute.  What is that thing?	[]
Kyle	9	1	Uh, oh, this, this is, the new retarded kid.	['retarded']
Ms. Crabtree	21	0	Oh-I'm sorry little girl.  But you still can't get on.  You have to take the special ed bus.	[]
Kyle	12	0	Boy, it looks like you're not welcome anywhere elephant.  See ya.	[]
Cartman	17	1	If a woman ever gave me crap, I'd say, Hey, you go do my laundry and-	['crap']
Ms. Crabtree	3	0	SIT DOWN KID!!!	[]
Cartman	3	0	Yes ma'am.	[]
Mr. Garrison	16	0	And now children, our friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all about genetic engineering.	[]
Mr. Hat	24	0	That's right Mr. Garrison, genetic engineering is an exciting new science.  You can splice the DNA from some animals, and make them better.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Mr. Garrison?	[]
Mr. Garrison	2	0	Yes Kyle.	[]
Kyle	9	0	With genetic engineering, can you make an elephant smaller?	[]
Mr. Garrison	24	0	Well, uh, ye, yes, I suppose you could.  You could, splice elephant genes with a dog, or cat, or a, pot-bellied pig genes.	[]
Kyle	30	0	That's it.  I'm going to combine my elephant with a pot-bellied pig and make...pot-bellied elephants.  They'd be smart like elephants, but small like pigs.	[]
Stan	4	0	That'd be cool!	[]
Bebe	6	0	I want a pot-bellied elephant.	[]
Pip	8	0	Yes, I'll pay fifty dollars for one.	[]
Terrance	3	0	That's stupid.	[]
Kyle	11	0	Shut up Terrance, we can geneti-cal engineer anything we want.	[]
Terrance	20	0	Oh yeah, I bet I can genetically clone a whole human being before you crossbreed and elephant and a pig.	[]
Kyle	6	0	I'll bet you can't.	[]
Terrance	3	0	Watch me plebeian.	[]
Mr. Garrison	19	1	Well, spank my ass and call me Charlie.  Isn't this exciting, two A+ students in a cloning war.	['ass']
Mr. Hat	16	0	Yes Mr. Garrison, genetic engineering lets us correct God's horrible, horrible mistakes, like German people.	[]
Mr. Garrison	31	0	You know, you boys might want to visit the Genetic Engineering Ranch outside of town for some help.  And you could both use this for your science fair projects next month.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Genetic Engineering Ranch!  Sweet!	[]
Stan	7	0	Wait, wait.  We still need a pig.	[]
Kyle	6	0	We can use Cartman's pig.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Ehh, you leave Fluffy out of this!	[]
Kyle	13	0	We're not gonna hurt her, we just need some of her blood.	[]
Cartman	21	1	You're not using any of Fluffy's blood, or else I'll kick you in the nuts.  Kyle, Kyle no!	['nuts']
Mr. Garrison	11	0	Uh, uhuh, Stanley, can I talk to you for a minute?	[]
Stan	1	0	Okay.	[]
Mr. Garrison	16	0	I couldn't help but notice that black eye you have.  Are there problems at home?	[]
Stan	1	0	Yes...	[]
Mr. Garrison	18	0	Oh dear.  Here Stanley, sit down, have some cocoa, and tell your friend Mr. Hat all about it.	[]
Mr. Hat	23	0	I'm your friend, Mr. Hat, Stan.  You can tell me anything.  Now, who hits you, is it your father, or your mother?	[]
Stan	6	0	Oh, neither.  It's my sister.	[]
Mr. Garrison	32	0	Your sister?!  Oh for Pete's sake, don't be such a little wuss.  Stop wasting Mr. Hat's time with pansy little foo-foo problems, and, give me back my cocoa!	[]
Jesus	11	0	Let's open the phone lines back up for some questions....	[]
Shelly	1	0	Hey!	[]
Robert	4	0	Yeah, is this Jesus?	[]
Jesus	3	0	Yes, my son.	[]
Stan	2	0	Hi Shelly.	[]
Shelly	6	0	Are you looking at my headgear?	[]
Stan	3	0	Headgear?  What headgear?	[]
Shelly	6	0	Are you looking at my headgear?	[]
Stan	9	0	Oh, uh gosh uh, I didn't really notice.	[]
Shelly	3	0	You little liar.	[]
Stan	10	0	No, I think it looks terrific.  It matches your AAAAAH!	[]
Kyle	4	0	Ready to go Stan?	[]
Stan	2	0	Go where?	[]
Kyle	5	0	To the Genetical Engineering Ranch.	[]
Kyle	15	0	We got Cartman's pig so we can splice its genes with my elephant's.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Nobody's splicin' nothing from Fluffy!	[]
Shelly	8	0	I swear I'm gonna kill you Stan!	[]
Kyle	9	0	Why's your sister so mean to you dude?	[]
Cartman	34	1	Yeah, if some sissy chick tried to kick my ass, I'd be all like, Hey, listen, missy, eh, yewhy don't you go knit me sweater before I slap you in the face!	['ass']
Shelly	3	0	Who said that?	[]
Kyle	4	0	This must be it.	[]
Cartman	14	0	Well, looks like nobody's home.  Guess we should come back some other time.	[]
Kyle	14	0	No, Cartman, we're going in there and splicing Fluffy and my elephant together.	[]
Cartman	11	0	It's okay Fluffy, I won't let them hurt you.	[]
Kyle	6	0	It's just a stupid pig.	[]
Stan	6	0	Yeah, quit being such a baby.	[]
Cartman	14	1	Baby?!  Well, at least I don't get my ass kicked by a girl!	['ass']
Stan	8	1	At least I'm not a little pigfucker!	['pigfucker']
Cartman	20	0	Hey!  I'm taking my pig and...Screw you guys!  I'm going home!  This whole idea's stupid anyway.	[]
Kyle	17	2	What the hell would you know you fat sweaty Mongoloid, you never get higher than a 'D'!	['hell', 'fat']
Cartman	16	1	Hey!  Why don't you go back to San Francisco with the rest of the Jews?!	['jews']
Kyle	9	2	There's no Jews in San Francisco, you retard!	['jews', 'retard']
Cartman	7	1	I'll kick you in the nuts!	['nuts']
Mephesto	4	0	Can I help you?	[]
Kenny	1	0	Mmmmmm!	[]
Kyle	11	0	Uh...yeah...we want to crossbreed an elephant with a pig.	[]
Mephesto	6	0	Brilliant idea, huge elephant-sized pigs.	[]
Kyle	20	0	No, no, no.  We want to make little pot-bellied elephants that people can keep in their houses as pets.	[]
Mephesto	10	0	Ohh, that's an even better idea.  Come on in.	[]
Mephesto	12	0	I'm so pleased that you children are interested in genetic engineering.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Eh, it's okay Fluffy, nobody's going to hurt you.	[]
Mephesto	43	1	It's thanks to the wonders of genetic engineering that soon there will be an end to hunger, disease, pollution, even war.  I have created things that will change the world for the better.  For instance, here is a monkey with four asses.	['asses']
Monkey	1	0	Mhhh.	[]
Kyle	7	0	How does that make the world better?	[]
Mephesto	14	2	And here, of course, is my four assed ostrich.  And my four assed mongoose.	['assed', 'assed']
Stan	10	1	Do you have anything besides just animals with four asses?	['asses']
Mephesto	34	0	Oh, uh, I suppose so uh.  Oh yes, over here.  Here I have rats splice with ducks, and gorillas spliced with mosquitos, and here I have rabbits spliced with fish to make little bunnyfish.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Heyyy, these bunny ears are tied on with little strings.	[]
Mephesto	11	0	And over here, Swiss cheese spliced with chalk, and a beard.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Well, what about our pot-bellied elephant?	[]
Mephesto	24	0	Oh.  Well I'm sorry children, but, pig and elephant DNA just won't splice.  Haven't you ever heard that song by 'Loverboy'?	[]
Kyle	4	0	Which song is that?	[]
Mephesto	24	1	Diindoon - pig and elephant DNA just won't splice!  Although, maybe I could help you add a few asses to that swine of yours.	['asses']
Cartman	10	1	You can keep your hands off of Fluffy's ass!	['ass']
Mephesto	16	0	You know, it's amazing what we can do with a little blood sample these days.	[]
Stan	1	0	Ow!	[]
Mephesto	5	0	Hmm?  What?  Oh, excuse me.	[]
Kyle	9	0	Wait, what are you taking Stan's blood for?	[]
Mephesto	11	0	Oh, pardon me, I tripped.  Could I have some hair please?	[]
Kyle	7	0	Watch out Stan!  Genetic engineers are crazy.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Come on Fluffy!	[]
Kid 1	7	1	This fish is just hurting my anus.	['anus']
Kid 2	5	0	Naw, it's pretty fresh.	[]
Cartman	5	0	UUuuhh.  I sure am hungry.	[]
Pip	15	0	'Ello gentlemen, any of you blokes know what's for lunch today?  Lunchy munchies, hmmm?	[]
Cartman	6	0	Go away, Pip! Nobody likes you!	[]
Kyle	8	0	Yeah, what kind of name is Pip anyway?!	[]
Pip	17	0	Well, my father's family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name being Phillip, my infant tongue...	[]
Cartman	14	3	God Damnit, would you shut the hell up?!  Nobody gives a rat's ass.	['damnit', 'hell', 'ass']
Stan	4	0	Yeah! Go away, Pip!	[]
Pip	1	0	Righto.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Gah, French people piss me off.	[]
Terrance	13	1	Hey dumbasses.  You morons give up on your stupid science fair project yet?	['dumbasses']
Kyle	6	0	No! We're already halfway done.	[]
Terrance	10	0	Halfway? Then all you've got is a stupid pig.	[]
Bill	8	1	Yeah, it's probably a gay pig too.	['gay']
Fosse	3	1	Stupid gay pig.	['gay']
Kyle	7	0	It's more than you've got!	[]
Terrance	11	0	Wroong. We've already got our human clone well under way.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Oh my God! They cloned a foot.	[]
Cartman	7	1	Ugh!...Hey! I'll kick your ass!	['ass']
Pip	1	0	Eho!	[]
Terrance	17	0	By Friday, we're gonna clone a whole human being.  Good luck with your stupid little pig.	[]
Chef	3	0	Hello there children.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Hey Chef.	[]
Chef	3	0	How you doin'?	[]
Boys	1	0	Bad.	[]
Chef	2	0	Why bad?	[]
Kyle	16	0	We need to genetically engineer our pig and an elephant, but their genes won't splice.	[]
Chef	17	0	Ahhhh, of course they won't splice children. Haven't you ever heard that song by 'Loverboy'?	[]
Chef	21	0	Dooodnnndoodnn - A pig and an elephant DNA just won't...A pig-elephant.  Say, now that's not a bad idea.	[]
Kyle	4	0	I told you guys.	[]
Chef	20	0	Imagine, a pint sized elephant that you could keep in the house.  Children, we could make a fortune with this.	[]
Kyle	8	0	You hear that dudes? We'll be rich!	[]
Chef	24	0	Forget about all that genetic engineering whoosafudge. If you want to combine a pig and an elephant, just get them to make sweeet love.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Whaaat?!	[]
Stan	12	0	I don't think an elephant would make love to a pig.	[]
Cartman	15	0	I don't think my pig would want to make love to that stupid elephant.	[]
Chef	14	0	Sure they would.  But you're gonna have to get 'em in the mood.	[]
Stan	6	0	So how do we do that?	[]
Chef	9	0	Do what I do, get 'em goood and drunk.	[]
Stan	11	0	Hey uh, you guys want to come over to my house?	[]
Kyle	19	0	We've got work to do Stan, I think it takes a while for an elephant to get drunk.	[]
Chef	15	0	Really, you, you guys don't want to come over for just a little bit?	[]
Cartman	9	1	Why?  Is your sister gonna kick your ass again?	['ass']
Stan	3	0	Shut up Cartman!	[]
Kenny	9	0	(Or are you gonna hit her with your hand?)	[]
Kyle	7	0	Yeah Stan, she's just a girl.	[]
Cartman	56	3	Yeah, if some girl tried to kick my ass, I'd be like, hey, why don't you stop dressin' me up like a mailman, annnd making me dance for you while you go and smoke crack in your bedroom and have sex with some guy I don't even know, on my dad's bed!	['ass', 'crack', 'sex']
Stan	8	1	Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?!	['hell']
Cartman	13	0	I'm just saying you're just a little wuss, that's all.	[]
Kyle	32	1	Stan, you can use family love as a weapon against Shelly.  The next time she's gonna kick your ass, just tell her, Shelly, you're my sister, and I love you.	['ass']
Kenny	9	0	(And I want to see you handling your breasts.)	[]
Stan	6	0	Sick dude, she's my sister.	[]
Kyle	17	0	Try it.  We'll see you in a while, we got to go get Cartman's pig.	[]
Cartman	15	0	No, you don't gotta get Cartman's pig!  You leave Fluffy out of this!	[]
Kyle	3	0	Come on Kenny.	[]
Cartman	23	1	Kyle no, seriously.  No fuckin' elephant is going to make love to my Fluffy, I...Kyle, I will kick you in the nnnnuts.	['fuckin']
Stan	1	1	Crap.	['crap']
TV Voice	12	0	And now back to Jesus and Pals on South Park Public Access...	[]
Shelly	6	0	Are you staring at my neckbrace?	[]
Stan	60	0	No, I mean, yes, I mean, what neckbrace?  Shelly, before you beat my face into a bloody pulp again, I just want you to know that...that you're my sister, and I love you.  No.  Ahh!  Someday, Shelly, I'm gonna be bigger than you, and you're gonna wish you'd never done any of this to me.	[]
Shelly	9	0	You'll never be bigger than me Stan.  Never!	[]
Mephesto	14	0	Beautiful, it's absolutely beautiful. My son, I think we've finally done it.	[]
Terrance	9	0	Yes, we have dad. My very own human clone.	[]
Bill	5	1	Hopefully not a gay clone.	['gay']
Fosse	4	0	Yeah, that was stupid.	[]
Bill	1	0	Stupid.	[]
Fosse	3	0	That was stupid.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Come on elephant, keep drinking.	[]
Stan	16	1	Damn, I wonder how drunk he needs to be to make sweet love to the pig.	['damn']
Kyle	6	1	Dammit! This is never gonna work.	['dammit']
Chef	16	0	Hello children.  I thought I'd check and see how our little entrepreneurial venture is going.	[]
Kyle	12	1	Rotten, they're both really drunk, but the won't have sex.	['sex']
Chef	95	0	Ohh, children, you just can't stick a drunk pig with a drunk elephant, and, and, expect them to do the mattress mambo. You need to set the mood.  Let me show you boys what I'm talking about. Tonight is a-right for love, you know I -- want tuh touch you where the lights don't go. Tonight is a-right for love, love gravy. Expressing love so sweet. I want tuh -- keep you burnin' like a dog in heat. Tonight is a-right for love, love graaavaaay. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Elton John!	[]
Elton	15	0	Oooo tonight Oooo it's all right Oooo tonight is right for love, love gravy.	[]
Chef	10	0	Thank you Elton. Tonight is right for love, love graaavaaaaaay.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Hey look!  It's working.	[]
Chef	15	0	Now children, gather around, and watch the wonders of life.  The beauty of Mother Nature.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Aah!	[]
Stan	1	0	Sick!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Fluffy!	[]
Chef	12	0	Hmm, now I know how all those white women must have felt.	[]
Mephesto	9	0	How luscious.  Our creature has come to fruition, boys.	[]
Terrance	5	0	Dad, you're the best.	[]
Mephesto	32	1	Oh my God!  He only has one ass.  He's of no use to me, I'll have to burn the room.  Oh no, this entire expriment is turning out very bad.	['ass']
Big Stan	2	0	Me bad??	[]
Mephesto	12	0	Eeegads, he's out of control.  We'll have to destroy him.	[]
Terrance	7	0	But he's our science fair project!	[]
Big Stan	7	0	Uhhh, me baad, aba-ba-chewy-chomp.	[]
Mephesto	5	0	He's too dangerous son.	[]
Terrance	7	0	But dad!  I want a human clone.	[]
Mephesto	21	0	Son, no.  Oh son, you've made a horrible mistake.  You've put all the people of South Park in jeopardy.	[]
Terrance	11	0	They're all stupid anyway.  Come on guys, let's go.	[]
Bill	5	1	Yeahh, they're all gay.	['gay']
Kyle	7	0	Aren't they ever gonna wake up?	[]
Chef	10	0	Oh, they will.  It's gonna be one uuuugly sight.	[]
Kyle	13	0	I thought you said the wonder of Mother Nature was a beautiful thing.	[]
Stan	10	0	Yeah, when does Mother Nature go from beautiful to ugly?	[]
Chef	37	1	Usually about 9:30 in the morning, children.  Uh oh, here we go.  Yeahhh, there's nothing worse than getting all drunk and waking up the next morning next to a pig.  Or a big fat elephant.	['fat']
Kyle	9	0	Hey, how do we know if she's pregnant?	[]
Chef	12	0	Well boys, we might not know that for a couple of days.	[]
Kyle	14	0	Couple of days?  But Terrance is going to have his human clone by tomorrow.	[]
Cartman	16	0	Well, good job Einstein, why don't we just build a rocket in the meantime?  Hey!	[]
Mephesto	17	0	Oh thank Buddha I found you boys.  You must tell me, have you seen anything odd lately?	[]
Stan	10	1	Uh, we saw an elephant have sex with a pig.	['sex']
Mephesto	5	0	No, no, I said odd.	[]
Chef	11	0	Hey, you're that crazy cracker from up on the hill.	[]
Mephesto	48	0	Sir, if making mutant animals spliced with humans is crazy...then...uhhhhh...hmmm...oh, nevermind.  I'm afraid there's been a bit of an incident at the ranch.  You see, I've created a large mutant clone of that little boy there, and he's broken free.	[]
Kenny	4	0	(A big mutant Stan?!)	[]
Stan	6	0	A big mutant version of me?	[]
Kyle	7	0	Is he bigger than a regular clone?	[]
Mephesto	18	0	He's terribly dangerous.  His brain is identical to yours.  I need you to help me find him.	[]
Big Stan	4	0	Ah chewy-chewy-chomp.	[]
Woman	3	0	Oh my Gooodd!	[]
Mr. Garrison	7	0	Stan, are you wearing a different hat?	[]
Big Stan	1	0	Uhhhyahhuhhh.	[]
Mr. Garrison	15	0	Hey, I know a certain young man who's itching for a detention.  Aaaaaah!  Ooooh.	[]
Kyle	7	0	How big do you think he is?	[]
Stan	7	0	I bet he weighs four hundred pounds.	[]
Kyle	12	0	Come on Stan, don't you even know where you would go?	[]
Kenny	7	0	(Look at that!  What's he doin'?)	[]
Stan	3	0	Oh my God!	[]
Townsman	1	0	Aaaah!	[]
Tom	51	0	It appears that the horrible, destructive creature is actually eight-year old Stan Marsh of South Park.  When asked why he was wreaking so much havoc on his home town, the little boy replies simply, Me Stan, ba-chomp, ba-chewy-chomp, ba-chewy-chomp.  Back to you in the studio.	[]
TV Newscaster	28	0	Thanks Tom, police are requesting that if you see this little eight-year old boy you immediately kill him and burn his body.  That's all for now.	[]
TV Voice	6	0	Now back to Jesus and Pals.	[]
Jesus	13	0	-- Yea, the way is paved with gold for ye who seek truth and-	[]
Big Stan	8	0	Ba-ba-chomp-betchaba-chewy-chewy-chomp-aaah.	[]
Jesus	1	0	Jesus!	[]
Big Stan	5	0	its-to-the-left-mayoueyea.	[]
Stan	15	0	Officer Barbrady, my evil genetic clone is destroying the town.  We have to find him.	[]
Officer Barbrady	18	0	You boys have been watching the X-Files too much, there's no such thing as genetic clone -	[]
Big Stan	1	0	Ahhhh	[]
Officer Barbrady	14	0	Whoa!  Listen, uh, you kids go on home, there's nothing to see here.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Come on, let's go!	[]
Uncle Jimbo	20	0	There you are!  Stanley, you tore up my entire gun shop, you better have a good explanation for this mister!	[]
Stan	12	0	It wasn't me Uncle Jimbo, it was my evil genetic clone.	[]
Mr. Garrison	16	1	Stanley, what the hell has gotten in to you?!  You have got severe lunchroom duty mister!	['hell']
Uncle Jimbo	11	0	I'm gonna go have a word with your father Stanley.	[]
Mr. Garrison	9	0	Yeah, you wait 'til your father hears about this.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Wait, Stan, there he goes.	[]
Stan	1	0	Stop!	[]
Big Stan	4	0	Ahhh, ba-ba-chomp?	[]
Kyle	4	0	He recognizes you dude.	[]
Stan	10	0	That's good, that's good dude.  Just calm down.	[]
Big Stan	6	0	Ba-chomp, eh mee ahh jaran.	[]
Kyle	6	0	What should we do with him?	[]
Stan	12	0	Stan, how would you like to go home and meet your sister?	[]
Big Stan	2	0	Ahhhh, yeahhh.	[]
Stan	34	1	...So remember, Shelly's the one with the big wire coming out of her mouth and a metal plate on her back.  When you see Shelly, kick her ass.  Shelly bad, Shelly very bad.	['ass']
Big Stan	2	0	Me bad??	[]
Stan	17	0	No!  Shelly bad, you good.  He's tearing up the house, stop him!  Come on Kyle, Cartman.	[]
Big Stan	1	0	Ah.	[]
Shelly	6	1	What the hell do you want?	['hell']
Big Stan	5	0	Chewy-chewy-chomp.  Ahhh.  Uhhh.	[]
Mephesto	8	0	Boys! Boys, I'm lusciously sorry for everything.	[]
Terrance	10	0	Hey, they've got our clone.  He belongs to us.	[]
Mephesto	29	0	No son, this beast is a disgrace to genetic engineers everywhere.  Boys, I'm sorry I've caused you such - inconvenience.  I tried to play God, and I failed.	[]
Terrance	2	0	Daddy! Nooooo!	[]
Mephesto	36	1	All I ever wanted was to genetically engineer something useful, but I failed.  Perhaps we shouldn't be toying with God's creations.  Perhaps we should just leave nature alone, to its simple one assed schematics.	['assed']
Terrance	11	1	You cheating bastards.  This isn't over, just wait until tomorrow.	['bastards']
Kyle	8	1	Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards!	['bastards']
Stan	19	0	Mom and dad are home.  My house is a disaster, you guy- you guys have got to help me.	[]
Cartman	11	1	I ain't helpin' crap!  I want to eat some paeh.	['crap']
Stan	8	0	You can't just leave me here alone.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Oh yeah, watch me.	[]
Kyle	18	0	Yeah Stan, we have to go find out if Cartman's pig is pregnant or not.  See ya.	[]
Stan	3	0	Thanks a lot.	[]
Shelly	8	0	Ohh boy, you are gonna get it now.	[]
Stan	35	0	It isn't fair!  Everybody hates me!  The whole town wants me killed!  Mom and dad are gonna send me away!  I don't want to be sent away!  I want to stay here!  Eehhhehehe!	[]
Randy	11	0	Stanley, what, what in God's name have you been doing?	[]
Carol	17	1	Everybody in town is upset with you young man.  What's going on?  Are you on drugs?	['drugs']
Shelly	6	0	It's not Stan's fault.	[]
Randy	1	0	Huh?	[]
Shelly	13	0	It wasn't Stan, he was...it was with me the whole time.	[]
Randy	13	0	Oh, well Stan, we're uh, we're sorry we jumped to conclusions.	[]
Carol	6	0	Oh honey, please forgive us son.	[]
Stan	50	0	Shelly, you, you saved my life.  And yet, you've done so much more than that.  Today you've taught me the meaning of family.  Sure, families don't always get along, but when the forces of evil descend upon us, we conquer them, by sticking together.  Uh, ahh, oooh.	[]
Mr. Garrison	22	1	Everyone, let's give K. C. and his weed a big hand.  Okay Kyle, we're ready to see your science project.	['weed']
Kyle	13	0	Well, our pig hasn't given birth yet, but she should anytime now.	[]
Mr. Garrison	24	0	Oh, well then I guess you get an 'F'.  Okay, Terrance, I know the class can hardly wait to see your science fair project.	[]
Terrance	35	1	Thank you Mr. Garrison.  Boys, Mr. Garrison, fellow students, for our science fair project Bill, Fosse, and I have spawned a creature genetically far superior to man.  I present to you, the five-assed monkey.	['assed']
Monkey	1	0	Ahhheh.	[]
Mr. Garrison	7	0	Oh, Mr. Hat, isn't it beautiful.	[]
Stan	12	0	Wait, wait, the pig just gave birth.  It, it had a baby!	[]
Kid 1	4	0	It had a baby?	[]
Kid 2	2	0	Oh wow!	[]
Clyde	5	0	What's it look like?	[]
Kyle	9	0	Does it look like a pig, or an elephant?	[]
Cartman	8	0	Hey, it kind of looks like Mr. Garrison.	[]
Mr. Garrison	16	0	Ohh, uh, gee, isn't that an amazing coincidence?  Hmm, what are the odds of that?	[]
Mr. Hat	6	0	Hmmm. You boys get first prize.	[]
Cartman	4	0	That'll do pig.	[]
