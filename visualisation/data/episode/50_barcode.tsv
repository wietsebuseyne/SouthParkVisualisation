Cartman	8	0	Mom! MOOOM! Mom!  Seriously! Something wonderful has happened!	[]
Liane	4	0	What is it, snookums?	[]
Cartman	27	0	Mom, look! The tooth fairy! I put a tooth under my pillow, and she gave me two dollars!  She's only given me a lousy quarter before!	[]
Liane	13	0	Oh my! She must think that you are a very special little muffin.	[]
Cartman	5	1	Yeah! This is so tits!	['tits']
Liane	5	1	Don't say tits, Eric.	['tits']
Cartman	7	0	Oh, I mean, this is so cool!	[]
Liane	19	0	Well, then, now you should take that money and open up a savings account that has compounded daily interest.	[]
Cartman	22	1	Heh, you can compound daily my ass with interest, Mom; I'm goin' to the toy store and buy me a skateboard!	['ass']
Liane	18	0	But Eric, I think maybe the tooth fairy wants you to use that money to learn about saving.	[]
Cartman	34	1	Mom, you don't know what the tooth fairy wants me to do with this money, okay? You're not the tooth fairy! I'll see you later!  Aw, man, this is so tits!	['tits']
Cartman	34	0	Hey you guys! You're not gonna believe this!  Oh my God, you guys, seriously!  Just wait until you hear this, you guys! I'm rich! I'm totally rich!  Aren't you stoked?!	[]
Stan	7	1	What the hell's wrong with Cartman?!	['hell']
Kyle	7	1	He's fat and he's stupid?	['fat']
Cartman	9	0	Look what the tooth fairy left me last night!	[]
Stan	2	0	Two dollars!	[]
Kyle	2	0	No way!	[]
Stan	3	0	For one tooth?	[]
Cartman	3	0	For one tooth.	[]
Stan	12	0	Dude, every time I lost a tooth I only got a quarter.	[]
Kyle	8	0	I only got a jar of gefilte fish.	[]
Cartman	14	1	Well, that doesn't matter, because I have an idea that is totally tits.	['tits']
Kyle	2	0	...Totally what?	[]
Cartman	52	0	Look, I don't know why the tooth fairy's being so cool to me. Maybe she's hot for me. I don't know, but if we all chip in with teeth, then I can hide them under my pillow and we could get enough money to buy a  Sega Dreamcast.	[]
"Stan, Kyle, Kenny"	2	0	Sega Dreamcast??	[]
Cartman	5	0	All we need is teeth.	[]
Stan	7	0	I already lost all my baby teeth.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Me too.	[]
Kenny	2	0	(Nuh-uh.)	[]
Kyle	6	0	You still have baby teeth, Kenny?	[]
Kenny	2	0	(No way!)	[]
Cartman	11	0	Kenny, think about it. Don't you want a  Sega Dreamcast?	[]
Kenny	6	0	(No I don't! Thank you.)	[]
Cartman	7	1	Alright! Kenny's in, you guys! Tits!	['tits']
Stan	13	0	Okay, the string is tied to Kenny's tooth. You ready over there?	[]
Kyle	4	0	Almost. You ready, Timmy?	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmiihh!	[]
Kyle	14	0	When I say go, you slam your electric wheelchair into high gear. Okay, Timmy?	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmiihh!	[]
Kyle	4	0	Right. You're Timmy.	[]
Timmy	2	0	Timmiihh! Lemmeouttaheah!	[]
Kenny	10	1	(Why the fuck does it have to be my tooth?)	['fuck']
Cartman	50	0	I'll tell you why it has to be you, Kenny: because your family is poor, and therefore has bad oral hygiene, so your teeth are gonna fall out someday, anyway. If you think about it, you should actually be thanking us.  Oh, thank you, guys. You're welcome, Kenny.	[]
Kenny	2	1	(Fuck you!)	['fuck']
Kyle	4	0	Alright! Get ready, Timmy.	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmiihh!	[]
Butters	9	0	Heh-hey guys, uh, wu-what are you doin'?	[]
Stan	27	0	What does it look like we're doing, Butters? We need a tooth, so we're using Timmy's wheelchair to pull out one of Kenny's.	[]
Butters	9	0	Oh. Heh, I got a loose tooth right here.	[]
"Stan, Cartman"	2	0	You what?	[]
Kenny	2	0	(You what?)	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmih-	[]
Butters	11	0	Yyep. Oo-one of mine came out not two hours ago.	[]
Stan	6	0	Uh, Butters, could we have it?	[]
Butters	32	0	Wwell, heck no! Uh you can't have it. Why, I'm gonna stick it under-my pillow and get money from the tooth fairy. She gives me fifty cents a tooth.	[]
Timmy	3	0	Ha-a-ugh.	[]
Butters	5	0	Well, uh, see ya, fellas.	[]
Kyle	15	0	Dude, maybe we don't have to rip a tooth out of Kenny's mouth.	[]
Stan	8	0	Yeah, we just have to get Butters' tooth.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Woohoo!)	[]
Cartman	8	0	How are we gonna get it from him?	[]
Stan	16	0	I guess we'll have to sneak into his house after he goes to sleep tonight.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Yeah, let's go.	[]
Timmy	5	0	Go! Timmy go!  Yeah, Timmy!	[]
Kyle	3	0	No, Timmy, wait!	[]
Timmy	4	0	Engh go uh Timmy!	[]
Kenny	5	0	(Hey, guys!)  (Heey-ungh)  (Oowww.)	[]
Cartman	11	0	Hahahahahaha. Hey, you guys, I can see Kenny's pengling, hahahahahaha.	[]
Timmy	2	0	Hu-aah!	[]
Cartman	3	0	Higher, you guys.	[]
Stan	14	1	Jesus Christ, why did we pick the fat guy to lift up in there?	['fat']
Cartman	20	1	Agh! Careful, you assholes!  To the left, you guys, left.  No, camera left, camera left!  That's it, now down.	['assholes']
Butters	8	0	What the-?  Who's there? Who is that?!	[]
Cartman	7	0	I am the tooth fairy, my child.	[]
Butters	19	0	Hoh. Sorry, Miss Fairy. I didn't mean to gaze at you. I'm back to sleep now, see?	[]
Cartman	10	0	Sure. Now I will leave you tidings under your pillow.	[]
Butters	13	1	Well, oh gosh, I, I didn't think you'd be so fat.	['fat']
Cartman	1	0	Ey!	[]
Kyle	3	0	Come on, fatass!	[]
Cartman	20	2	Do not open your eyes until morning.  Or else I will kick you in the nuts.  Square in the nuts.	['nuts', 'nuts']
Butters	5	0	Yuh, yu-yes ma'am!	[]
Stan	1	0	Well?	[]
Cartman	3	0	Bull's eye!	[]
Liane	11	0	Tucky tucky time, it's the best time of the night.	[]
Cartman	8	0	I love that song, Mom. Sing it again.	[]
Liane	13	0	No, honey, Mommy's gotta save her throat. I have to work tonight.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Okay.	[]
Liane	8	0	Good night.  What do you have there, Eric?	[]
Cartman	13	0	Another tooth fell out today; I'm leavin' it for the tooth fairy.	[]
Liane	20	0	Oh, my. The tooth fairy will have to give you a big surprise for losing two teeth in two days.	[]
Cartman	3	0	I know, huh?	[]
Cartman	26	1	You guys! Oh my God, you guys! You're not gonna believe it! It's beyond rational thought, you guys!  Holy crap, you guys! I mean-	['crap']
Kyle	5	0	Did the tooth fairy come?	[]
Cartman	2	0	Four dollars.	[]
Stan	3	0	Oh my God!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Four dollars?	[]
Kenny	3	0	(Oh, my God!)	[]
Cartman	5	0	Do you what this means?	[]
Stan	13	0	Yeah. We just gotta keep finding teeth and putting them under your pillow.	[]
A Dentist	2	0	Dentist office.	[]
Liane	9	0	Oh. Eh-hello, Dr. Roberts? It's Ms. Cartman.	[]
Dr. Roberts	10	0	Oh, yes, Ms. Cartman. What can I do for you?	[]
Liane	21	0	Well, it's my son. He's lost a lot of his baby teeth, and I was starting to get worried.	[]
Dr. Roberts	15	0	Well, losing baby teeth is a natural thing, Ms. Cartman. How many has he lost?	[]
Liane	5	0	About a hundred and twelve.	[]
Dr. Roberts	4	0	...A hundred and twelve.	[]
Liane	12	0	Yes. Fifteen of them in one night. Perhaps he should switch toothpaste?	[]
Dr. Roberts	46	0	Your son wouldn't happen to be an alligator, would he? No? Hm, I see. Well, I'm afraid I can't help you right now. The American Dental Association convention is this week, but, as soon as I get back, I'll look into it.	[]
Liane	7	0	O-oh, thank you. Freebie next week.	[]
Dr. Roberts	1	0	What?	[]
Cartman	6	1	Tih-  Tooth?  What the hell? Mom!	['hell']
Liane	2	0	Yes, Eric	[]
Cartman	15	0	You know, the tooth fairy forgot to bring me money last night! Call the police!	[]
Liane	61	0	Oh. Eric, poopie, sit down.  Mommy has something to tell you. It's just that- well, there is no tooth fairy, Eric. I've been putting all that money under your pillow, and because you got so many teeth fall out, I've actually run out of money and can't go to the grocery store for at least a month.	[]
Cartman	36	0	You almost had me for a second there, Mom, heh. There's no tooth fairy. I suppose you're gonna tell me there's no Santa Claus, Easter Bunny, or Jesus, either, heh, heh...  M- Mom?	[]
Liane	11	0	I'm sorry, Eric. All children find out sooner or later.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Yi- you're serious here. There really is no tooth fairy?	[]
Liane	5	0	No, honey. It's just-	[]
Cartman	14	0	How could-? How could you lie to me, Mother? Lie right to my face?	[]
Liane	10	0	Oh, Eric, it's just part of being a child.	[]
Cartman	33	0	How can I trust you?  How can I trust anyone ever again, Mother? I guess, uh to make it through this life, I can only trust myself.  Myself and Willikins Bear, of course.	[]
Liane	3	0	Eric! Eric, wait!	[]
Cartman	5	0	No, Mother! No more lies!	[]
Stan	5	0	Dude, where's the money?	[]
Cartman	4	0	There is no money.	[]
Kyle	3	0	No more money??	[]
Stan	15	0	What are you talking about, Cartman?! We're only $167 away from gettin' a Sega!	[]
Cartman	2	0	I know!	[]
Kyle	5	0	Cartman, what's going on?!	[]
Cartman	14	0	You guys...  Oh, God, I don't even know how to tell you this.	[]
Stan	3	0	Tell us what?!	[]
Cartman	15	0	You guys, there's... there's no tooth fairy, you guys. There, I said it.	[]
Kyle	9	0	What do you mean, there's no tooth fairy?	[]
Cartman	21	0	My mom has been giving me the money all this time, and your parents are the ones who left you money.	[]
Stan	1	0	Dude.	[]
Kyle	11	0	That can't be. My parents wouldn't lie to me.	[]
Cartman	25	0	But now my mom has given us so much money that she's bankrupt, and we're poor, like Kenny.  Don't touch me, Kenny.	[]
Kyle	14	0	You're wrong. If my dad says something is real, then it's real!	[]
Cartman	5	0	Kyle, open your eyes, man!	[]
Kyle	4	0	It's not true!	[]
Gerald	3	0	Oh, hello, son.	[]
Kyle	8	0	Dad, there is so a tooth fairy, huh?	[]
Gerald	9	0	What? Oh. Kyle, let's have a little talk.	[]
Kyle	8	0	Oh my God! You did lie to me.	[]
Gerald	10	0	No. Kyle, she's just make-believe. Like Peter Pan.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Peter Pan, too??	[]
Gerald	1	0	Kyle...	[]
Kyle	5	0	What about Moses and Abraham?	[]
Gerald	5	0	Well, they were probably real.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Probably?! Is Atlantis real??	[]
Gerald	2	0	Probably not.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Wahahahah!	[]
Gerald	13	0	Look, Kyle, adults make up those things because they're fun for children.	[]
Kyle	20	0	Fun for children?! Fun for children?! Look at me, Dad! I don't even know what's real anymore! Weaaaah!	[]
Cartman	15	0	Man, I can't believe all our parents lied to us about the tooth fairy.	[]
Kyle	10	0	What about Dan Rather? Do you think he's real?	[]
Cartman	8	0	No, man, that's just a TV show.	[]
Stan	8	0	You guys! You guys! I figured it out!	[]
Cartman	8	0	What? That your parents lied to you, too?	[]
Stan	12	0	Yeah, but, it's okay! We can still get our Sega Dreamcast!	[]
Cartman	1	0	How?	[]
Stan	9	0	Look, the tooth fairy is all made up, right?	[]
Kyle	8	0	All made up. Not real. Nothing's real.	[]
Stan	41	1	So all we have to do is go to a really rich kid's house, put our tooth under his pillow, wait for his parents to leave him a whole buttload of money, and then sneak back in and take it!	['buttload']
Kenny	1	0	(Woohoo!)	[]
Stan	6	0	The kid will never even know.	[]
Cartman	15	3	Oh, dude, that is tits! I mean, that is big fat Oprah tits right there!	['tits', 'fat', 'tits']
Kyle	9	0	Oh my God, what if I'm not real?	[]
Stan	15	0	We can take the bus to the city. There's super-rich people down there!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Kyle	12	0	I mean, what if I'm just part of my parents' reality?	[]
Stan	3	0	Come on, Kyle!	[]
Kyle	9	0	What if this is all just somebody's dream?	[]
Cartman	8	0	Wow, look at the size of these houses!	[]
Stan	26	0	Totally, dude. Cherry Creek is the richest part of Denver. I'll bet these kids get at least ten bucks a tooth from the  Tooth Fairy.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Hey,  that house looks perfect. There's obviously kids living there.	[]
Stan	60	0	There. You can tell this is the kid's window 'cause it's got Mega Man stickers on it. Cartman, once you're in the kid's room, leave the tooth under the pillow, then come back out. We'll wait for the parents to see it and leave money, then swing you back in the house to grab it.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Got it.	[]
Stan	7	0	This is the smartest business venture ever.	[]
Cartman	2	0	What the-?	[]
Stan	8	1	Hey, what the hell are you guys doing?!	['hell']
Boy 1	26	0	We're gonna sneak a tooth under this rich kid's pillow, then come back and collect the tooth fairy money that his parents leave him.	[]
Stan	6	0	...Hey, you can't do that!	[]
Boy 2	2	0	Why not?!	[]
Stan	7	0	Because that's what we're doing!	[]
Cartman	6	0	Yeah! You ripped off our idea!	[]
Boy 2	16	1	What the hell are you talking about?! We've been doing this for over two years!	['hell']
Kyle	2	0	Two years?	[]
Blond	12	0	Nice tooth fairy costume. You think anybody'd believe you in that?!	[]
Cartman	14	0	It's better than your dress! You look like a bad Jennifer Lopez nightmare!	[]
Blond	3	0	How dare you!	[]
Boy 1	15	0	Look, this is our turf! You'd better scram before the Boss breaks your legs!	[]
Stan	6	0	You scram! We were here first!	[]
Rich kid	10	0	What's going on?  Oh! It's the tooth fairies!	[]
Boy 2	8	0	Oh, nice going! Now you woke him up!	[]
Stan	4	0	You woke him up!	[]
Rich kid	17	0	I don't have any loose teeth, Miss Fairies but I have been a very good boy.	[]
All	2	0	Shut up!	[]
Boy 1	13	0	Alright, that does it! Come on, we're going to see the Boss!	[]
Stan	4	0	Who's the Boss?	[]
Boy 1	1	0	Loogie.	[]
Loogie	14	0	My associates here tell me you were working Cherry Creek tonight. Is that true?	[]
Stan	2	0	Uuh, yeah.	[]
Boy 1	15	0	Right on our turf, Boss! I ain't ever seen that kind of disre-  Erp.	[]
Cartman	4	0	We were there first!	[]
Loogie	29	0	Kids have been doing the tooth fairy racket in this town for years.  I do it just like my big brother before me, and my oldest brother before that.	[]
Stan	8	1	Damnit! And we thought we were so original!	['damnit']
Loogie	19	0	Let me ask you something: You were gonna sneak a tooth under this rich kid's pillow? Then what?	[]
Stan	6	0	Well, uh-what do you mean?	[]
Loogie	17	0	How are the kid's parents gonna know there was a tooth under their child's pillow?	[]
Boy 1	12	0	Ha! You guys don't even know how the tooth trade works!	[]
Stan	5	0	What's a tooth trade?	[]
Loogie	121	0	Look, any shmuck can sneak through a window wearing a pretty dress. The tooth racket is much more involved.  We keep careful track of what houses we've hit so that we don't hit the same one twice in less than two months.  Inside the house we not only have to sneak a tooth under the pillow, but leave a note for Mom and Dad to see.  This is how we let the parents know to leave money under the pillow.  Once the note is in place in the last house, we start all over, going back to the first house. But this time, all we have to do is collect money.  And the kids never know what hit 'em.	[]
The South Park boys	1	0	Wow!	[]
Loogie	18	0	The hardest part is getting teeth. We tried various places. Cemeteries , hockey games , anywhere we can find them	[]
Beat-up Boy	1	0	Nooo!	[]
Loogie	24	0	The teeth we do manage to acquire are then sorted according to size, color, and quality.  But there's never enough teeth. Never enough.	[]
Stan	1	0	Amazing.	[]
Cartman	4	1	Man, that is tits!	['tits']
Loogie	12	0	And now my only problem is, what do I do with you?	[]
Boy 1	1	0	Rowwr!	[]
Loogie	16	0	Tell you what: how would you like to run the South Park tooth racket for me?	[]
Stan	6	0	Oh. Uh-I don't know.	[]
Loogie	11	1	It's that, or else I can cut off your penises.	['penises']
Cartman	20	2	Hm. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Hm's see...	['penis', 'penis']
Kyle	1	0	Cartman!	[]
Stan	10	0	How much do we get if we work for you?	[]
Loogie	7	0	I'll cut you in at 2%.	[]
Cartman	9	1	Two percent, have my penis cut off.  Two percent-	['penis']
Stan	3	0	We're in!	[]
Dr. Roberts	95	0	Fellow dentists: As you all know, we are still having numerous reports of missing teeth from all over the country. There are also reports of missing tooth fairy money. We believe that there can be only one logical reason for all of this.  A giant half-chicken/half-squirrel  that steals either teeth or money from children as they sleep in order to build some kind of giant nest  for its genetically superior and potentially dangerous offspring! We believe also that this creature would have at least a mild understanding of algebra , and that it-	[]
Dentist	11	0	Uh, excuse me? I think I have a more logical theory.	[]
Dr. Roberts	10	0	...Yeah. Weh well, by all means, Mr. Foley, enlighten us!	[]
Mr. Foley	31	0	I think what we've got here is some kind of black-market tooth racket. Something where one group is stealing the money and teeth from another group for a profit.	[]
Dr. Roberts	9	0	Oh, Mr. Foley, you realize how ridiculous that sounds.	[]
Mr. Foley	14	0	It's not ridiculous. It's very possible. I've seen it happen before.	[]
Dr. Roberts	1	0	Where?!	[]
Mr. Foley	2	0	In Montreal.	[]
Dr. Roberts	6	0	And where, pray, is this Montreal?!	[]
Mr. Foley	37	0	Look, I know how to handle this. All we have to do is bring down the kingpin and the rest will fall. You'll see! I'll have it taken care of in a matter of weeks!	[]
Dr. Roberts	23	0	Uhyub-dub very well, Mr. Foley, you go on your wild goosechase and meanwhile, we'll deal with the real problems at hand.	[]
Mr. Foley	3	0	Well, I will!	[]
Dr. Roberts	31	0	Anyway, the half-chicken/half-squirrel would most likely be about three to four-and-a-half feet tall. His large beak is probably detachable, and works as a flotation device.	[]
Boy	14	0	Here! Here, over here, look! Look what I got- I got from the chef!	[]
Chef	3	0	Hello there, children.	[]
The Boys	2	0	Hey, Chef.	[]
Stan	6	0	We all want double-desserts today!	[]
Chef	13	0	Oh. Well, uh, I'm afraid that the school charges extra for that.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Yeah? Well, that ain't nothin' but a thang.	[]
Chef	13	0	Oh my God! There has got to be at least fifteen dollars here!	[]
Cartman	8	0	That's right. Keep the change, my man.	[]
Chef	35	1	Well! Look at you cute little crackers! With your money and your fancy clothes and your cell phones, it's almost like you were-  Oh my God, children! What have I told you about drugs?!	['drugs']
The Boys	15	0	That there's a time and a place for everything, and it's called college.	[]
Chef	29	3	That's right. And the only thing worse than doin' drugs is dealin' drugs! I'm gonna tell you about when I was your age and got offered drugs.	['drugs', 'drugs', 'drugs']

Stan	11	0	Dude, having this much money is great! Working for Loogie rules!	[]
Cartman	27	0	Yeah, but you know, why do we need Loogie? We know how the trade works: why don't we do it ourselves and keep all the profit?	[]
Stan	11	1	We can't do that, dude. Loogie will kick our asses.	['asses']
Cartman	24	1	Oh, what the hell is that little Pollack gonna do, huh? Come on, you guys. I say we create our own mob crime family!	['hell']
Kyle	13	0	Dude, this book says there could be infinite alternate realities to every reality.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Sure, Kyle.	[]
Loogie	52	1	They're what?! They're not gonna pay me? Who the hell do they think they are? I want those South Park kids dead! I want their families dead! I want their houses burned to the ground!  Oh, hi there, Mister. My mommy and daddy are out front, if you need 'em.	['hell']
Mr. Foley	18	1	Let's cut the crap, kid. My name is Tom Foley. I'm with the American Dental Association.	['crap']

Mr. Foley	17	0	No thanks, I just brushed. I just wanted to let you know that I'm onto you.	[]
Loogie	28	0	I told the ADA a thousand times: I know nothing about teeth. I'm just an 8-year-old boy who likes climbing trees and playing in puddles.	[]
Mr. Foley	29	3	I am going to find out who the boss is! And when I do I'm gonna bust his ass and everyone's ass who helped hide his ass!	['ass', 'ass', 'ass']

Anchor	21	1	...to which Ms. Clinton replied, I don't even like Vagina. Finally tonight, a human-interest story. Dan Akawa is live.	['vagina']
Dan Akawa	40	0	Thanks, Tom. I'm here at the house of little Billy Circlovich, um. Billy is in desperate need of a bone-marrow transplant  or he will most certainly die.  Billy, how much more money do you need for the transplant?	[]
Billy	4	0	Sih, six hundred dollar-.	[]

Dan Akawa	11	0	Well, Billy, I also understand that you lost a tooth today.	[]
Billy	1	0	Yehahah.	[]
Dan Akawa	31	0	Billy, we want you to put that tooth under your pillow tonight, because we have a feeling that the tooth fairy  is going to leave you six hundred dollars for it!	[]
Billy	1	0	Really?	[]
Mr. Circlovich	1	0	Really?	[]
Dan Akawa	29	0	Yes, really.  Six hundred dollars. I might also mention that Billy lives in Crestview Apartments, just off Arapaho Road on Emporia Street. Back to you, Tom.  How was that?	[]

Kyle	19	0	Dude, this book says I don't exist unless I think I do. But what if I don't?	[]
Cartman	8	0	Will somebody take those books away from him?	[]
"Mrs, Circlovich"	11	0	Be sure to put your loose tooth under your pillow, Billy.	[]
Billy	3	0	Okay-y, Mom.	[]
Mr. Foley	53	0	Thank you for helping out, gentlemen.  If this sting operation works, some bogus tooth fairies should be showing up to take the sick kid's money. When they touch the kid's pillow, an alarm will sound, and that's when you hit the button, Murphy, and activate the lights. Everybody got it?	[]
Dentists	2	0	Got it.	[]
Murphy	39	0	Duuuh, which button do I hit again, boss?  Just kidding. You know how there's always the dumb guy in sting operations in the movies? I was, you know I was actin', I was actin' like him, eheh, oh.	[]

Kyle	23	0	I can't deal with it, Stan. I mean, all the stuff I've been reading; I really don't think I exist!	[]
Stan	6	0	Dude, just stop thinking about it.	[]
Kyle	19	0	But I can't, because, what if thinking about it is the only thing keeping my space-time together?	[]
Kenny	7	0	(You guys! You guys, over here! ...Hey!)	[]
Kyle	14	0	Sometimes I think I can see time slowing down,  and my own existence fading.	[]
Billy	6	0	G'night, Mom. G'night, Dad.	[]
Mr. Foley	6	0	Alright. Everyone, keep your eyes peeled.	[]
Billy	28	0	I'm going to bed now, Mommy. I put my tooth under the pillow. Do you really think the tooth fairy will give me money for the transplant?	[]
Mr. Circlovich	7	0	I think so, Billy. I think so.	[]
Billy	11	0	Well, I can't wait to feel healthy and strong again.	[]
Cartman	19	0	Yeah, well, you're gonna have to wait a little bit longer, Billy, 'cause that 600 bucks is mine!	[]
Kyle	28	0	Light is a wave unless it's observed? That means all matter is just a wave.  Nothing's real! Reality in a nuh- Oh God, it's happening!	[]
Stan	1	0	Kyle?	[]
Murphy	8	0	Eh something strange is happening with the computers.	[]
Loogie	8	0	Well, well, well. What do we have here?	[]
Stan	2	1	Aw, shit.	['shit']

A voice	8	0	This is reality! I am everywhere , and nowhere.	[]
Mr. Foley	3	1	What the hell?	['hell']
Cartman	1	0	Kyle?	[]
Kyle	5	0	I am nothing, and everything.	[]
Dr. Roberts	4	0	Well, I told you!	[]
Mr. Foley	5	0	Let's get outta here!	[]
Kyle	5	0	Hunh. That was pretty weird.	[]
Loogie	16	0	Jesus! The little sick kid was a setup all along!  How could I be so stupid?!	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Loogie	18	1	I can't believe I fell for such an obvious trap! What the hell is wrong with me?!	['hell']
Cartman	25	0	Weh-well, uh, du-don't take it too hard, dude, uh. That's what grown-ups do.They lie. Lie right to your face.	[]

Stan	9	0	So you're not gonna hurt us or nothin'?	[]
Loogie	14	0	Naah. In a way, I'm just glad the whole thing's over with.	[]
Kyle	52	0	Yeah. But you know, I've learned something today. You see, the basis of all reasoning is the mind's awareness of itself. What we think, the external objects we perceive, are all like actors that come on and off stage. But our consciousness, the stage itself, is always present to us.	[]
Cartman	1	1	...Tits.	['tits']
Timmy	1	0	Timmy!	[]
