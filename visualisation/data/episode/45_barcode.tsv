Stan	5	0	Ready? 1-2-3-4.	[]
Cartman	14	0	Hey, dude. Do you like to rock?!  Yes, I like to rock! Helloo, Baltimore!	[]
Kyle	7	1	Cartman, what the hell are you doing?	['hell']
Cartman	5	0	I'm playing the drum.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Well, you have to hit it softer!	[]

Kyle	13	0	You're not supposed to rock, you're supposed to keep the beat!	[]
Cartman	9	0	I am keepin' the beat; your flute-playing sucks!	[]
Stan	10	0	That's it, Cartman, you can't be the drummer!	[]
Cartman	5	0	Ey, I'll get it!	[]
Kyle	15	0	Dude, the Civil War reenactment is tomorrow! You're not gonna get it by tomorrow!	[]
Cartman	3	0	Yes I will!	[]
Stan	12	0	Alright alright. Let's just try it again. 1-2-3-4.	[]
Cartman	9	1	Go!!! Does Cleveland like to rock?! Go!!! Yes, damnit!	['damnit']
Kyle	1	0	Cartman!!!	[]
Cartman	1	0	What?	[]
Kyle	9	0	Give me the drum, and you play the flute.	[]
Cartman	6	1	No way! Flutes are totally gay!	['gay']
Kenny	4	1	(Oh. Flutes are gay?)	['gay']
Stan	19	0	Cartman, I'm the leader of the Reenactment Fife and Drum Squad, and I say you play the flute!	[]
Cartman	14	0	Oh! Well, you know what I say?!  Screw you guys, I'm going home!	[]
Kyle	2	1	You dick!	['dick']
Cartman	1	0	Later.	[]
Jimbo	51	0	Alrighty everyone. We just have a few things to go over before we head out to the reenactment battlefield.  First of all, I have great news. There are over 200 folks from around the state that have come to see this year's reenactment, and that's the best turnout ever!	[]
Men	3	0	Yes! Woohoo, yea!	[]
Stan	19	1	Where the hell is Cartman? If he misses the orientation, they're not gonna let him in the reenactment.	['hell']
Kyle	3	0	He'll show.	[]
Stan	3	0	He'd better!	[]
Jimbo	28	0	I'm also very proud to announce that this year's alcohol sponsor, Jagermin's S'more-flavored Schnapps, the schnapps with the delightful taste of s'mores.	[]
Men	2	0	Whoa. Mmm.	[]
Mr. Garrison	7	0	Mmm. It does taste like s'mores.	[]
Stuart	10	0	Hih yeah, and it's got quite a kick, too.	[]
Jimbo	34	0	And now, to clarify how the reenactment should unfold, let's bring up our master historian, Grandpa Marvin Marsh,  the only man old enough to have actually seen the Civil War... reenactment of 1924.	[]
Kyle	8	0	Wow, dude! Your grandpa still isn't dead?	[]
Stan	5	0	Dude, that's not cool.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Good morning, gentlemen.	[]
Stan	7	1	Cartman, what the hell are you doing?	['hell']
Kyle	8	0	Yeah! You're dressed up like the South.	[]
Cartman	30	1	Yes. This year, I've decided to fight for the glorious South. Screw you guys, home. And may I say that we're going to whup your ass this time.	['ass']
Stan	16	0	You can't just come to a Civil War reenactment dressed up like General Lee, fatass!	[]
Cartman	9	0	Oh, really? I'm pretty sure I just did.	[]
Grandpa	25	0	Okay, you all know the rules. You must fire your blanks into the air, and if someone says they killed ya, you gotta play dead.	[]
Kyle	10	0	The South loses this battle, Cartman. They lose the war!	[]
Cartman	7	0	Nuh uhn, the South is gonna win.	[]
Kyle	5	0	No they're not, stupid!	[]
Cartman	3	0	Yes we are!	[]
Kyle	6	0	How much do you wanna bet?!	[]
Jimbo	43	0	Now remember, everybody: for a good reenactment we've got to pretend down to the last detail that we're really in the Civil War. So when the North wins, all of us on the Confederate side should act all bummed and depressed.	[]
Kyle	14	0	Come on, Cartman! How much do you wanna bet the South doesn't win?!	[]
Cartman	24	1	Well, this war is about slavery, so how about if the South wins, you two assholes have to be my slaves for a month.	['assholes']
Kyle	12	0	And if the North wins you're our slave for a month??	[]
Cartman	1	0	Right.	[]
Kyle	3	0	You're on!	[]
Cartman	14	0	Then I shall bid you good morning, gentlemen, and see you on the battlefield.	[]
Stan	4	1	Hoohoo what a dumbass!	['dumbass']
Kyle	13	0	Yeah. He doesn't even know that the South loses the Civil War.	[]
Stan	10	0	It's gonna be rad having Cartman be our slave.	[]
Jimbo	16	0	...And with that, let's all go to Tamarack Hill and put on a good show!	[]
Men	3	0	Yes! Woohoo, yea!	[]
Announcer	30	0	Welcome to the South Park reenactment of the Battle of Tamarack Hill. The men in gray are the Confederacy, from the South ; in blue are the Union, from the North .	[]
Grandpa	44	0	It was a cold morning in 1862. The Union Army had to get the bell of Appomattox down from Tamarack Hill. What ensued was a bloody battle, but after many hours, the Union Army prevailed. Here now is the reenactment of that great battle.	[]
Jimbo	1	0	Forward!	[]
Randy	7	1	Let's bring those Confederate bastards down!	['bastards']
Jimbo	1	0	Fire!	[]
Confederate Reenactors	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Randy	3	0	Alright men, fire!	[]
Union Reenactors	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Randy	11	0	Hey, uh, I shot you, Ned. You have to fall down.	[]
Ned	1	0	Ow.	[]
Randy	2	0	Yeh-hah!	[]
Man 1	8	0	Oh, so this is what it was like.	[]
Man 2	6	0	Hey! What's that guy doing?!	[]
Cartman	5	0	Yippie! Long live the Confederacy!	[]
Reenactors	2	0	Huh? Wha-?	[]
Grandpa	3	1	What the hell?	['hell']
Randy	4	0	He took the bell!	[]
Gerald	5	0	He can't do that!	[]
Grandpa	7	0	The Confederacy doesn't take the bell!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Hooray for the South!	[]
Stan	6	0	Cartman, you can't do that!	[]
Grandpa	8	1	God damnit! Now we have to start over!	['damnit']
Jimbo	40	0	Alrighty everyone.  We're going to do the entire reenactment again, because of some confusion over the bell. Now, I know you're just trying to help Eric, but we have to let the Union capture the bell this time.	[]
Cartman	8	0	But why? Why should they get the bell?	[]
Jimbo	8	0	Wuh. Well, 'cause we're supposed to lose.	[]
Cartman	7	0	But we don't have to lose.	[]
Jimbo	1	0	What??	[]
Cartman	69	0	Gentlemen, we can win this battle!  Sure, we could lose, and tonight we can go back to our families and say, We did it! We lost like we were supposed to! Aren't we proud?! Or, or we take that hill. We take that hill, and when we stand tall upon it, we hold our heads high, and we yell, Not this year! This year belongs to the Confederaseh!	[]
Jimbo	5	0	By God, he's right!	[]
Mr. Garrison	1	0	Jimbo!	[]
Jimbo	40	0	Yeah, I've been reenacting this war for 22 years now. And for 22 years us Confederate reenactors have had to spend the evening being ridiculed and made fun of by the Union reenactors! Well, I'm sick of it!	[]
Mr. Garrison	11	1	Yeah! Why do we have to be their bitches every year?!	['bitches']
Stuart	7	0	I'm tired of losing this battle!	[]
Jimbo	15	1	And I say it's high time we kicked some ass! Who's with me?!	['ass']
Reenactors	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Reenactor	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Grandpa	25	0	Alright, folks. Sorry for the false start. We're ready to go again. It was a cold morning in 1862. The Union Army had to-	[]
Confederate 1	1	0	Yaaaaah!	[]
Confederate 2	14	0	Come on! Just give up! We're not gonna let you live another day!	[]
Gerald	5	0	Uh, what are they doing?	[]
Mr. Garrison	5	1	You Yankee sons of bitches!	['bitches']
Randy	3	0	Ow! That hurt!	[]
Grandpa	8	2	God damnit, what the hell are they doing?!	['damnit', 'hell']
Kyle	4	0	What do we do?!	[]
Stan	5	0	Run for your life, dude!	[]
Cartman	18	0	God bless those men that fight for their freedom. God bless those men! And God bless the Confederasah!	[]
Reenactor	2	0	Come on!	[]
Randy	1	0	Oh?	[]
Jimbo	4	0	Surrender your men, general!	[]
Randy	6	0	Jimbo, have you lost your mind?!	[]
Jimbo	4	0	SURRENDER YOUR MEN, GENERAL!	[]
Randy	4	0	Alright, alright. We surrender.	[]
Barbrady	3	0	The South win?	[]
Jimbo	3	0	The South wins!	[]
Reenactors	2	0	Yeah, woohoo!	[]
Grandpa	2	1	God damnit!	['damnit']
Jimbo	15	0	Well, we can all be friends now.  Come on, Randy. Have some s'more schnapps.	[]
Randy	10	0	Uh, I can't be happy. You ruined the reenactment.	[]
Jimbo	7	0	Aw, come on. Have a little sip.	[]
Cartman	11	0	So, you guys about ready to start being my slaves yet?	[]
Kyle	3	0	You cheated, Cartman!	[]
Stan	28	1	Yeah, but it doesn't matter, because the bet was that the South doesn't win the war! And the South still didn't win the war, dipshit!	['dipshit']
Kyle	16	1	Yeah. Too bad you're such a dumbass in history, or you would have known that!	['dumbass']
Cartman	20	0	I hate you guys so much. So very very much. And this is not over. Not by a long shot.	[]
Randy	19	1	All I'm saying is that... is that the Confederates would have just gotten their asses kicked in Topeka!	['asses']
Mr. Garrison	13	1	That ain't true! The Confederates would have whupped ass in Topeka, too!	['ass']
Bartender	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Reenactor	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Gerald	3	0	You're dreaming!	[]
Cartman	5	0	Perhaps we should take Topeka.	[]
Jimbo	1	0	Huh?	[]
Cartman	19	0	They mock us in Kansas, soldier. They think the South is a joke. They don't respect our authoritah.	[]
Jimbo	3	0	They don't?!	[]
Cartman	6	0	No. I say we take Topeka.	[]
Jimbo	17	0	You know what? I'll bet we could take Topeka right now and clear them all around!	[]
Randy	1	0	Huh?	[]
Stuart	18	0	That's right! Maybe we should do what the Confederates would've done and march on to Topeka!	[]
Mr. Garrison	5	0	I'll bet we could!	[]
Jimbo	6	0	I'll bet we could, too!	[]
Cartman	6	0	I'll bet you can't.	[]
Jimbo	10	0	What?!  Is that a challenge?! I'll bet we can!	[]
Cartman	12	0	I'll bet you can't, because you guys are all pussies!	[]
Jimbo	26	0	Pussies?! Oh yeah?! Men! It's time to show the world what the Confederate Army has got! We're gonna take Topeka once and for all!	[]
Reenactor 1	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Reenactor 2	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Jimbo	21	0	All o' you men. You may have lost in the Union today, but join us now and win back your pride!	[]
Reenactor 3	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Reenactor 4	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Randy	5	1	Well, the Union be damned!	['damned']
Jimbo	3	0	Let's go!	[]
Men	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Cartman	25	0	Oh! What was our bet again? Let's see... Yes, I remember. If the South wins you have to be my slaves for a month.	[]
Kyle	14	0	They're just drunk, Cartman! As soon as they sober up, they'll stop.	[]
Cartman	31	0	Yes. E-e-enjoy your freedom, gentlemen. Soon, you will be my properteh. Come, Kenny. Come fight for us, and I'll make sure you get lots of plunder and womens.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Woohoo!)	[]
Mailman	5	0	Oh good morning, Mrs. Hollis.	[]
Mrs. Hollis	2	0	Hello, Ralph.	[]
Ralph	10	0	Did you happen to catch that ball game last night?	[]
Mrs. Hollis	10	0	I'm afraid I was grading papers pretty late and-	[]
Driver	5	0	What's that noise, officer?	[]
South Park Men	2	0	Yeah! Yeah!	[]
Jimbo	1	0	Ccchhhhaaaarrrrggggeeee!	[]
Officer	1	0	Ow!	[]
Stuart	11	1	Freeze, buddy. These are blanks, but they still hurt like hell!	['hell']
Jimbo	10	0	It's ours, it's ours! We've taken Topeka!	[]
Reenactors	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Randy	14	0	Alright, Yank, tell us where you keep your Jagermin's S'more-flavored Schnapps?!	[]
Ralph	16	0	Uh-uh-uh schnapps? Uhm, uh-uh-I guess that would be at the liquor store.	[]
Randy	1	0	WHERE?!	[]
Ralph	8	0	At the liquor store, at the liquor stohohohohore!	[]
Randy	3	0	Come on, boys!	[]
Mrs. Hollis	10	0	This is the most bizarre thing I've ever seen.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Excuse meh.	[]
Stan	13	0	Dude, my mom is sooo pissed at my dad for going to Kansas.	[]
Kyle	25	0	I know, but-why do they have to take it out on us? Why do we have to wait around for them to come back?	[]
Stan	14	0	Oh here comes the bus.  Butters? Are you the only one that came back?	[]
Butters	16	0	Uh, conuh-  Confederate Messenger Butters reporting, sir. I have a message for you from the battlefield.	[]
Stan	2	0	What battlefield?!	[]
Butters	31	1	Uh Topeka. We're raisin' all kinds of hell, see?  Eh, it's probably the most fun I've had in several months. Wuwell, you gonna read your message or not?	['hell']
Cartman	88	0	Dear guys. Words cannot express how much I hate you guys. As we fight our way northward into the great unknown, only that one thing remains certain: that I hate you guys with every tired muscle in my Confederate body. We have taken Topeka, and now I must lolly the men over to Missouri. Because I will not stop until we have won it all, and you guys are my slaves. Because, I hate you guys. I hate you guys so very very much. Yours, General Cartman Lee	[]
Stan	7	3	God damnit, that fat piece of shit!	['damnit', 'fat', 'shit']
Kyle	16	0	Dude! What if Cartman really does succeed? And we really do have to be his slaves??	[]
Stan	6	1	That would suck so much ass.	['ass']
Kyle	6	0	We have to stop him, dude.	[]
Stan	17	0	I'll go get my grandpa. He'll help us. Where's the Confederate Army now, Butters?	[]
Butters	30	1	Uh-uh, wuh-I ain't supposed to tell you that. If I told you that, well, why I'd be a, a no-good Yankee son of a bitch.	['bitch']
Kyle	6	0	We'll give you 10 bucks.	[]
Butters	4	0	Oh. O-oh, okay.	[]
Reporter	84	0	...And she was forced to live off her own feces for several days. In national news,  a frightening radical group from Colorado is making its way across the Southern states of America.  The group is recruiting new members in every town they pass through, and rapidly growing in number.  So authorities have decided to call in the National Guard. The groups seems to be led by military mastermind and right-wing radical Jimbo Kern , who is known for his guerrilla-fighting and leadership skills.	[]
Jimbo	13	0	Give me some more s'more schnapps! I'm gonna be sick.  Blouach.	[]
Stan	8	0	Oh, boy. This is worse than I thought.	[]
Grandpa	17	0	Well, come on Billy, we've gotta make these little peckers stop before they get themselves killed.	[]
Man	1	0	Aaaaa!	[]
Brunet	10	0	They say you can either fight them or join them.	[]
Blond	8	0	Well I'm joining them. Those blanks hurt!	[]
Stan	8	0	Dad, Dad.  Mom wants you to come home.	[]
Randy	10	0	Not now, uh Stan, I'm pillaging.  Get over here!	[]
Kyle	19	0	You've got to stop, Dad. If the South wins, me and Stan have to be Cartman's slaves!	[]
Gerald	21	0	This is a reenactment, Kyle. My name is Pvt. John Fugasol, and I have to do what my general tells me!	[]
Jimbo	8	0	Hey! There's some more schnapps over here!	[]
Gerald	2	0	More schnapps!	[]
Sgt. Larsen	15	0	I'm Sgt. Larsen of the National Guard. We're here to stop the terrorists.	[]
Grandpa	14	1	They're not terrorists, they're just a bunch of drunk wankers from Colorado.	['wankers']
Larsen	14	0	Well, we can't just shoot 'em; there's innocents and children about. Dawkins!	[]
Dawkins	1	0	Sir!	[]
Larsen	4	0	Fire a warning flare!	[]
Dawkins	2	0	Yes sir!	[]
Jimbo	1	0	Medic!	[]
Larsen	1	0	Woops.	[]
Stan	6	0	Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!	[]
Grandpa	2	1	You bastards!	['bastards']
Kyle	1	0	Hey!	[]
Soldier	12	0	We can't fire at them, sir. There are too many children.	[]
Larsen	6	0	Then how do we stop them?	[]
Stan	10	0	I know! But we'll have to wait until dark.	[]
Cartman	96	0	Dear Ms. McCormick. It is with a very heavy heart that I must inform you that your son Kenny was killed in battle  on the morning of November 18, at Ruby Hills Funland in Chattanooga. This war has taken something from all of us, and, although your son seems to be the only casualty so far, know that we all share your pain. Your son did not die in vain. I shall persevere and make Stan and Kyle my slaves. Because I hate those guys. I hate them so very very much. Yours, General Cartman Lee.	[]
Stan	19	0	There, you see? We take the s'more schnapps, and by morning they're all gonna wanna go home.	[]
Grandpa	3	0	Nice thinkin', Billy.	[]
Larsen	3	0	Let's go.	[]
Jimbo	4	0	Where to next, General?	[]
Cartman	6	0	Where did the Confederates go, son?	[]
Jimbo	17	0	Well, I guess uh Fort Sumter in South Carolina. That's where the Civil War really escalated.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Ah, splendid. Then to Fort Sumter we shall go.	[]
Jimbo	15	0	Welluh, that sounds great. I'm gonna get some s'more schnapps. You want anything?	[]
Cartman	17	0	Yeah. Can I get some of those animal cookies? Those frosty ones with the sprinkles on 'em.	[]
Jimbo	11	0	Um, sure.  What the-? Ey, where's the s'more schnapps?	[]
Randy	7	0	We're out of s'more schnapps?	[]
Mr. Garrison	4	0	That can't be.	[]
Jimbo	6	0	I guess we drank it all.	[]
Dawkins	2	0	Now what?	[]
Stan	17	0	Now we just wait until morning. Check-mate, Cartman. Pretty soon, you're gonna be our slave.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Soldier 1	1	0	Uugh.	[]
Soldier 2	1	0	Ouch.	[]
Randy	3	0	Oh, my head.	[]
Gerald	3	0	Where am I?	[]
Jimbo	20	0	Ned, I think I can say without any doubt that that was the longest drinking binge we've ever had.	[]
Ned	6	0	Mmm-oh. Gmm-oh, my head.	[]
Mr. Garrison	10	0	Oh no, I'm supposed to be at work today.	[]
Stuart	2	0	Me, too.	[]
Jimbo	15	0	Well, come on everybody. We've got to get to the nearest bus station, quick.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Where are you going?	[]
Jimbo	7	0	We're goin' home kid. Come on.	[]
Cartman	11	0	We can't go home, we have to take Fort Sumter!	[]
Randy	16	0	Uh, the only thing we have to do is get home before our wives leave us.	[]
Cartman	8	0	No! What about the Confederasuh?! What about freedom?!	[]
Stan	4	0	Haha! You lose, fatass!	[]
Cartman	5	0	God, I hate you guys!	[]
Kyle	43	0	Yeah, but you know? I think you've learned something today. You've learned that you can't rewrite history.  You see, history is forever,  and everything happens for a reason.  Sure, you can try and change the past, but usually you kno-	[]
Stan	4	0	Where are you going?	[]
Cartman	13	0	This isn't over! Oh no! Oh no, not by a long shot!	[]
Randy	12	0	Ogh. I don't believe we came all the way out here.	[]
Jimbo	14	0	Yeah? Well, I don't think the bus station is too far from here.	[]
Stuart	15	0	Uh, how much do you think a bus ticket back to Colorado is gonna run?	[]
Suzette	23	0	Allo, I am Suzette, the S'more Schnapps girl.  We are pleased to sponsor you with all the S'more Schnapps you need.	[]
Randy	9	0	Awgh, I can't drink anymore of that stuff.	[]

Cartman	24	0	Uh uh come uh, come on, guys. Just one little drink. Uh a toast to how far you came and all that you saw.	[]

Mr. Garrison	11	1	Hey, guys. Let's all play a game of grab ass.	['ass']
Gerald	4	1	What's grab ass?	['ass']
Mr. Garrison	15	1	You know. We just run around in circles and try to grab each others' asses.	['asses']

Mr. Garrison	1	0	Hohoho.	[]
Solders	5	0	I got you. Oo-oh.	[]

Jimbo	4	0	You heard the General.	[]
Soldiers	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Stan	2	0	Oh, no.	[]
Kyle	6	0	We'll never stop them now.	[]
Soldiers	1	0	Woohoo!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Yes! Yes!	[]
Guide	36	0	Throughout 1861 the Confederate authorities tried to drive out the Union occupants of Fort Sumter peacefully. But Abraham Lincoln's administration would not surrender the fort to the Confederates, so Jefferson Davis decided to take action.	[]
Tourist	6	0	And the Confederates won the fort?	[]
Guide	34	0	Yes.  Imagine what it must have been like: you're a Union soldier stationed at this fort, and one day, you look out and see thousands of Confederates ready to pounce on you.  Uh...	[]
Cartman	3	0	Take the fort!	[]
Jimbo	1	0	Charge!	[]
Men	5	0	Yeah!  Woohoo, yeah, come on!	[]
Jimbo	7	0	We got it! The fort is ours!	[]
Randy	3	0	What was that??	[]
Larsen	37	0	Attention political activists: you are on government historical document property! Surrender the document with your hands up! If you would like a tour of the fort, one can be arranged through the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce.	[]
Stan	12	0	Give up, fatass! There's over a hundred National Guards down here.	[]
Cartman	3	1	Suck my ass!	['ass']
Jimbo	8	0	What do we do, General? We're outnumbered.	[]
Cartman	16	0	We asked the State of South Carlina for recruits. The reinforcements are bound to show up.	[]
Larsen	9	0	Alright, that does it. Blow the whole thing up.	[]
Stan	10	0	No, you can't do that. Our dads are there.	[]
Larsen	16	0	Sorry, son. We tried it your way; now we do it our way. Prepare the mortar.	[]
Elderly Voice	4	0	Hold it right there!	[]
Jimbo	12	0	Wow, look at that! The entire state of South Carolina showed up!	[]

Stan	2	1	Aw, damnit!	['damnit']
Leader	11	0	We're ready to fight with ya. Long live the Confederacy!	[]
Men	4	0	Yee-haw! All right!	[]
Cartman	18	0	Now our numbers are truly great. It is time. It is time to march to Washington D.C.!	[]
Jimbo	15	0	Hey, government! You can't ignore our anguished cries anymore! You hear that?! You Government?!	[]
Al Gore	7	0	Oh boy, this doesn't look good.	[]
Advisor	16	0	It's just like the Million Man March, except that there actually are a million people.	[]
Aide	9	0	Mr. President! A message for you from the extremists!	[]
Cartman	57	0	Dear Mr. President. There are times when humans can no longer endure their government's authoritah. You must declare the Confederaceh its own nation so that we may enter into a new millennium of prosperitah. If you do not meet our demands, we will be forced to show the videotapes we have of you with Marisa Tomei.	[]
Clinton	10	0	Oh, dear God! Wuh-we have to meet their demands.	[]
Advisor	11	0	What?? Sir, there's- there's not that many of them.	[]
Al Gore	23	0	As Vice-Persident, I think we'd better give them what they want. It's just the Southern states; who really needs them?	[]
Clinton	17	0	My hands are tied. Tell General Lee that I'll meet him in front of the Capitol.	[]
Aide	1	0	Sir!	[]
Al Gore	10	0	I'm so glad I don't have your job.	[]
Stan	18	0	Dude, let's just give up right now and accept that we have to be Cartman's slaves.	[]

Kyle	1	0	What??	[]
Cartman	12	0	The North still won the Civil War! That means slavery is abolished!	[]
