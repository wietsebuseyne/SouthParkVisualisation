Cartman	3	1	Oh, god dammit!	['dammit']
Kyle	1	0	Haha!	[]
Cartman	29	1	Shutup, Jew!  Yes, well. For my project, I made a pencil, taped to a pen. In this way we see the duality of writing devices that occur in nature.	['jew']
Ms. Choksondik	15	0	You just put that thing together just now! I'm giving you a check minus.	[]
Cartman	6	1	Oh GODDAMMIT I HATE CHECK-MINUS!	['goddammit']

Cartman	7	0	I'll make you eat your parents!	[]
Ms. Choksondik	4	0	What did you say?!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Nothing!	[]
Ms. Choksondik	5	0	Alright, Token, you're next.	[]
Token	43	0	Using my laptop computer, I hooked into the Internet and found a meteorology Web site.  I donwloaded the data, and with my dad's video projector, I can show you the graph I made of predictable weather patterns over the next three months.	[]
Clyde	1	0	Wwooww.	[]
Token	15	0	I also printed out the results on my color printer. Here you are, Ms. Choksondik.	[]
Ms. Choksondik	9	0	Very very good, Token. You get a check plus.	[]
Token	1	0	Alright!	[]
Cartman	5	1	Aw, that is such bullcrap!	['bullcrap']
Ms. Choksondik	6	0	Eric, for the love of God.	[]
Cartman	32	0	No! No, see, this is the fundamental flaw with the check check-plus check-minus system! The only reason Token was able to do all that is because his family is rich!	[]
Token	5	0	My family isn't rich.	[]
Cartman	32	0	Oh, come on, Token! Your new house is four times the size of anyone else's in town! And who else gets crab cakes and, and lobster tail in their lunch boxes?!	[]
Stan	5	0	Your family is rich, dude.	[]
Token	2	0	But I...	[]
Cartman	15	0	Let's just see where Token's clothes come from, shall we?  Ooooo, Armani Exchange!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Aharmani Exchange?	[]
Cartman	27	0	All the rest of us have to buy our clothes at J mart! Have you even been inside a J mart, Token?!  I didn't think so!	[]
Stan	13	0	Yeah, dude, your family is so rich they have their own pool table.	[]
Butters	13	0	Yeah. And their own sprinkler system. You don't think you're rich?	[]
Linda	6	0	Hello Token. How was school today?	[]
Token	15	0	Mom? Dad? Why do we have a bigger house than everybody else in South Park?	[]
Bob	7	0	Well, because we have more money, son.	[]
Token	4	0	I know. But why?	[]
Bob	47	2	...W-well, because we went to graduate school and therefore have more lucrative jobs than most people in town. For instance, your mother is a chemist for a pharmaceutical company, whereas your friend Eric Cartman's mother is a crack whore. One pays more than the other.	['crack', 'whore']
Linda	6	0	Why, sweetie? What's the matter?	[]
Token	14	0	All the kids at school made fun of me today because I'm rich.	[]
Bob	1	0	...Oh.	[]
Token	22	0	I don't wanna be rich anymore! I wanna eat macaroni and cheese for dinner and, and wear clothes from J mart!	[]
Linda	2	0	J mart?	[]
Bob	10	0	Son, you, you don't know what you're saying.	[]
Token	17	0	I just wanna be like all the other kids in South Park. Please, Mom and Dad, please.	[]
Bob	8	0	You... sure you want to do this, son?	[]
Token	3	0	I'm sure.	[]
Linda	1	0	Hmmm...	[]
Bob	4	0	Where's the... valet?	[]
Linda	8	0	He must be parkiing someone else's car.	[]
Bob	24	0	Ah, here we go.  Take good care of it, please.  Here's twenty dollars.  Hoh?  They've activated some kind of alien blinding device.	[]
Token	11	0	That's not a blinding device, Dad. It's fluorescent lighting.	[]
Bob	1	0	Oh.	[]
Linda	13	0	Excuse me, where can where would we find young men's fashion apparel?	[]
Obese Woman	6	0	Aisle 6, next to the pretzels.	[]
Bob	3	0	Next to the-?!	[]
Token	19	0	Come on!  Hey look: there pants are only five bucks apiece. They must really suck. What do ya think?	[]
Linda	5	0	What, what brand are they?	[]
Token	10	0	It doesn't matter, Mom. They're poor people pants.	[]
Randy	8	0	Hey, uh, Sharon? Isn't that the Williamses?	[]
Sharon	18	0	Huh?  Oh. Yeah, it is.  What are they doing here? They can afford to shop at Cherry Creek.	[]
Liane	10	0	Do you see that, Sheila? The Williamses are shopping here.	[]
Sheila	16	0	I don't get it. He must pull in at least two hundred thousand a year.	[]
Bob	17	0	S-son, can you just hurry it up? I don't think we quite fit n here.	[]
Cartman	15	0	Oh, looks like you landed on Park Avenue, Stan. You own me ten million dollars.	[]

Cartman	6	0	Hey, you changed your clothes, Token.	[]
Token	12	0	Yeah, well, you know, I did a little shopping at J mart.	[]
Stan	13	0	Alright, well, let's just watch the Lion King. Cartman's cheating anyway.	[]
Token	3	0	Here you go.	[]
Stan	3	0	What's that?	[]
Token	8	0	It's a DVD of the Lion King	[]
Stan	8	0	DVD? We don't own a DVD player.	[]
Kyle	8	0	Yeah, dude.  Nobody does. They're too expensive.	[]
Cartman	10	1	Not too expensive for Token's rich ass family, apparently.	['ass']
Craig	8	0	Don't you have a VHS of it?	[]
Token	4	0	I only have this.	[]
Cartman	19	0	Oh, well, let me take this disk up to the Enterprise and see if Captain Kirk can decrypt it.	[]
Token	4	0	What's a VHS?	[]
Cartman	3	0	Oh, Jesus, dude.	[]
Stan	13	0	Come on, guys. We'll just have to find other stuff to do.	[]
Kyle	4	0	What's a VHS?	[]
Token	141	0	Why can't I be like all the other kids? They all have three-bedroom homes, broken trucks on their lawns. And cut-up hot dogs for lunch It's not my fault my parents succeed so much. There's no one in town I can relate to. I play with autographed baseball bats while everyone else just plays with sticks and pine cones Has a boy ever felt so alone? Well, who needs them anyway? I won't pretend to be something I'm not If I can't be poor, I've got to deal with what I've got. If I can't be like them, what I need is more rich kids around, So I'm not the only one, and then I won't be so... down. Please, God, send more rich kids... To my... Town	[]
Will Smith	21	0	Ooo, look at this, honey.  A beautiful unspoiled town in the Rockies. This is just what we've been looking for!	[]
Jada Pinkett Smith	8	0	Like Aspen was 30 years ago. Sounds nice.	[]
Will Smith	21	0	We could buy hundreds of acres of land for next to nothing! And then I could finally live like a cowboy.	[]
Jada Pinkett Smith	14	0	Oh Will, the country would be such a nicer place to raise our kids!	[]
Will Smith	2	0	O kids?	[]
Older Boy	2	0	Yes, Daddy?	[]
Will Smith	10	0	How would you like to move to the Colorado Rockies?	[]
Older Boy	3	0	The mountains, Daddy?	[]

Older Boy	22	0	Ah, a local boy. You shall be our new playmate. I'm Frederick. This is my sister Lisa, and my brother Daniel	[]
Token	3	0	I'm Token.	[]
Lisa	12	0	Our daddy is a very famous actor. What does your daddy do?	[]
Token	7	0	Aah, he's a lawyer. I think.	[]
Will Smith	20	0	How quaint. Kids, why don't you play with little Token while your mother and I check out the town.	[]
Frederick	13	0	Very well. Come, local boy.  Show us how to play your mountain games.	[]
Token	4	0	All right!  Thanks, God.	[]
Token	17	0	...And this is the room where my mom and dad keep their original v-Van Gogh painting.	[]
Frederick	17	0	Yes, yes, we have one of those, too. In fact, we have seven of them, I believe.	[]
Token	6	0	You do? God, that's great!	[]
Daniel	1	0	Why?	[]
Token	31	0	I'm just so happy you guys moved into town. You see, I used to be the only rich kid. All the other families here are kinda  low to  middle-income.	[]
Lisa	7	0	Why? What happened to all their money?	[]
Token	7	0	Well, they never really had any money.	[]
Lisa	12	0	Well, then, why don't their daddies just act in a movie?	[]
Token	5	0	Well I... think that.. they...	[]
Frederick	9	0	Sometimes children must be very firm with their daddies.	[]
Lisa	1	0	Indeed.	[]
Frederick	18	0	Like when Daddy doesn't want to act in a movie because he thinks the script is bad.	[]
Lisa	15	0	So we must plead with him:  Please, Daddy, please! It's twenty million dollard, Daddy.	[]
Daniel	3	0	Please, Daddy, please!	[]
Frederick	9	0	Twenty million is still twelve million after taxes, Daddy!	[]
Lisa	5	0	I want a llama, Daddy!	[]
Frederick	6	0	I'd do the picture, Daddy!	[]
Lisa	2	0	Please, Daddy!	[]
Frederick	2	0	Daddy, please!	[]
Lisa	5	0	Daddy, do the movie, Daddy!	[]
Daniel	2	0	But Daddy!	[]
Frederick	6	0	And so Daddy does the picture.	[]
Token	3	0	...That's ...great.	[]
Lisa	4	0	Twenty million dollars great.	[]

Snoop Dogg	11	0	Oho yes, the kids bug me about it all the time.	[]
Will Smith	19	0	Well I found the place, Snooty-roo. It's in the Rockies, but totally undiscovered, laid-back, and beautiful.	[]
Snoop Dogg	4	0	Ogh. It sounds lovely!	[]
Will Smith	21	0	You really should come give it a look. Jada and I would love for some friends to move here with us.	[]
Snoop Dogg	25	0	I certainly will, William. And perhaps I'll give ol' Maigc and Kobe Bryant a call. They've been looking for vacation properties as well.	[]
Will Smith	11	0	Great! Well, let me let you get back to your recording.	[]
Snoop Dogg	5	0	Hah, see you soon. Bye.	[]

Jimbo	24	0	Yeah. How many rich people does it take to screw in a light bulb? None! They can hire people to do it for them!	[]
Mr. Garrison	40	0	Yeah. Hey, hey, you guys know why richers have such big garages? 'Cause they need a place for all their Porsches and boats and aircraft carriers!  Yeah, that's right, cashchucker! Go have fun with your two million dollar house!	[]

Passenger 1	5	0	Uh huh, looks like it.	[]
Token	77	0	Hello, my name is Token. I don't fit in with all the kids at South Park Elementary so, I invited a bunch of rich kids to move to town. The problem is, I don't fit in with them, either.

Token	1	0	Roar!	[]
Lion 1	6	0	What are you doing here, boy?	[]
Token	13	0	You- you talked. I, I understood you. I must be becoming a lion!	[]
Lion 2	17	0	You're not becoming a lion. The only way you can do that is to see Aslan.	[]
Token	3	0	Who's Aslan?	[]
Lion 1	5	0	Very well, walk this way.	[]
Aslan	11	0	Is this the boy who's been living in our realm?	[]

Aslan	13	0	He-you may. But being a lion may be harder than you think.	[]
Reporter	53	0	A billion billionaires are gathering their ranks and will be marchng on the town square tonight  in South Park to petition the end of separate bars, bus seating and restaurants. It looks like it will be a great turnout, as some of the millionaires also paid several thousand Mexicans to march for them.	[]
Skeeter	10	0	If they get that petition passed, it's all over.	[]
Jimbo	17	0	I guess we learned our lesson: you can't fight rich folk; they're just too powerful.	[]
Mr. Garrison	9	0	Now, come on! Is that any way to talk?	[]
Skeeter	11	0	They won, Garrison. They can't be scared out of town.	[]
Mr. Garrison	20	0	No! We just haven't scared them the right way! Think about it. What scares rich people more than anything?	[]
Jimbo	1	0	...Ghosts?	[]
Mr. Garrison	17	0	Bingo! Rich people don't want to live in South Park if they think it's HAUNTED!	[]
Men	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Mr. Garrison	19	0	Everyonen get some sheets from home! If we can't chase the richers out, we'll spook 'em out!	[]

Token	8	0	...I thnk I'm gonna go home now.	[]
Aslan	12	0	Home. But I thought your friends made fun of you at home.	[]
Token	49	0	They do. But, I guess I learned something today. You see, even though kids at South Park make fun of me, I still like hanging around them more than snobby rich kids or, lions. Even though I may be different from them, I still like my old friends best.	[]
Aslan	23	0	It sounds like you learned much, young lion apprentice. Very well. But before you go, perhaps you would like... a stick of gum?	[]
Token	2	0	...No thanks.	[]
Aslan	5	0	Go on. It's spearmint!	[]
Token	21	0	No, because there's a spring in there, and if I pull the gum out, it's gonna hurt my finger.	[]
Aslan	16	0	Oh. So you don't want any gum then? Are you... sure? Go on, try it!	[]
Token	1	0	Ow.	[]
Aslan	4	0	That is good stuhuff!	[]
