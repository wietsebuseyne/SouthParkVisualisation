Butters	14	0	Heh-alright, Mom, I'm all done wrappin' Dad's anniversary present for ya.	[]
Chris	7	0	Oh, is it someone's anniversary soon?	[]
Linda	2	0	Oh, you!	[]
Chris	8	0	Just kidding.  Oh, I wonder what it is.	[]
Butters	16	0	It's a-  Awww, shucks,  I can't tell you. Uh, but it's really nifty.	[]
Chris	32	0	Well, looks like we're gonna have to do somethin' extra-special for Mommy and Daddy's anniversary this year. How about on Saturday we all go have dinner at Bennigan's!	[]
Butters	21	0	Bennigan's?? Oh, boy, you mean it??  Whoopee, at Bennigan's I'm gonna get the Rain Champ baby-back ribs!	[]
Linda	10	0	Calm down there, cowboy. You've still got four days.	[]
Butters	14	0	Four days? Oh, I don't know how I'm gonna wait that long!	[]
Choir	34	0	Who's the boy that can laugh at a storm cloud? Turn a frown into a smile for free? Who's the kid with a heart full of magic? Everyone knows it's Butters!	[]
Butters	3	0	That's me.	[]
Choir	35	0	Who's the boy with the eyes full of wonder? Who thinks being yourself is the best thing to be? Who's that rascal with the tweezers in his pocket? Everyone knows it's Butters!	[]
Butters	3	0	That's me.	[]
Choir	50	0	Jumpin' in puddles, skippin' down the hallway Pettin' at the petting zoo. He loves John Alway. Who's that tyke with the cutest little dimples, Battin' his eyes at every puppy he sees? If you look inside yourself, you might be surprised when you find A little boy named Butters!	[]
Butters	6	0	Thaat's that's me,  Yeah. .	[]
Butters	18	0	Three more days till we eat at Bennigan's. That's s-seventy-two hours. Aw gee whiz.	[]
Chris	38	0	Well, if you two will excuse me, I need to go and buy a certain special lady her anniversary present. Linda: I hope he means me, haha. Butters: Don't be silly, Mom. Of course he means you.	[]
Chris	16	0	I'll be back in a little bit.  Butters, you're in charge of the house.	[]
Butters	2	0	Yes sir!	[]
Linda	11	0	Oh, I wonder what he's gonna get me this year?	[]
Butters	10	0	We won't know until we're at Bennigan's.	[]
Linda	34	0	Every year it's the same. Your father gets me some great gift and my gift to him falls short.  I've just got to outdo him this year, I've just got to.	[]
Butters	7	0	Dad's a good shopper all right.	[]
Linda	15	0	Butters, maybe you could secretly follow your dad and see what he's getting me.	[]
Butters	14	0	You mean, spy on him? Uh but... ain't that kind of like... fibbin'?	[]
Linda	22	0	No, it's a little different. You remember when the nice policeman gave you a badge and made you an honorary inspector?	[]
Butters	3	0	Sure I do!	[]
Linda	21	0	Why, I think Inspector Butters could find out what Daddy'd getting Mommy without him ever knowing.  What do you say?	[]
Butters	8	0	Inspector Butters in on the case, ma'am!	[]
Choir	5	0	Everyone know it's Butters!	[]
Butters	4	0	Uh, that's me!	[]
Butters	10	0	Hm. Dad's going to see a movie. How nice.	[]
Butters	4	0	White Swallow Bath House	[]
Choir	5	0	Everyone know it's Butters!	[]
Butters	4	0	Uh, that's me!	[]
Butters	4	0	I'm back, Ma!	[]
Linda	11	0	Oh, hi sweetie. Did you get to follow your dad around?	[]
Butters	10	0	I sure did.  Dad sure had a nice night out.	[]
Linda	11	0	Well, did you see what he got me for our anniversary?	[]
Butters	8	0	Well first, he went to see a movie.	[]
Linda	14	0	A movie? Hmmm. I wonder why he'd wanna see a movie by himself.	[]
Butters	31	0	I don't know. But it wasn't the movie theater at the mall. No, it was that, really old theater downtown. The Studcat.  I didn't know it was open.	[]
Linda	8	0	Wait a minute. What was the movie called?	[]
Butters	10	0	Fisting Firemen 9  I've never seen 1 through 8.	[]
Linda	3	0	Oh my God...	[]
Butters	51	0	Uh but it must have been a real short movie, though, because Dad came out, like, ten minutes later. ...And it must have been a sad film, too, because, he had a bunch of tissue paper with him when he came out. Poor old Dad, the movie really got to him.	[]
Linda	8	0	Butters, where did Daddy go after the movie?	[]
Butters	3	0	To the gym.	[]
Linda	3	0	To the gym?	[]
Butters	5	0	Yeah. The White Swallow Spa.	[]
Linda	1	0	Gaah!	[]
Butters	30	0	Yep. He went in there and wrestled with all kinds o' guys. He wasn't too good, though. This one black guy had him pinned down for fifteen minutes straight!	[]
Linda	12	0	...Butters? Are you sure about this? You have to be absolutely sure!	[]
Butters	58	0	Inspector Butters gets all the facts. I even got some neato pictures.  The only thing I can't figure out is why dad told you he was goin' shoppin' for your present when he was goin' out to see the movies an' wrestlin'.  Oh, did you have a nice trip, Mom? See you next fall. Hahaha, yo- Ma?	[]
Choir	1	0	...Butters!	[]
Butters	4	0	Uh, that's me!	[]
Linda	6	0	Paaiint. Must paaiint. Everything clean. Paaiint.	[]
Chris	10	0	Well, honey, you've painted the entire house. Three times.	[]
Linda	6	0	Must paaiint. Everything clean. Everything new!	[]
Chris	16	0	Say Butters, m-I'm havin' real trouble finding an anniversary present for Mom. Any ideas?	[]
Butters	8	0	Hm. Uh-I can't think of one.	[]
Chris	14	0	Well then, it looks like I'm gonna have to go out shopping again.	[]
Linda	7	0	Ungh. Paaiint. Everything clean. Everything new. Paaiint.	[]
Chris	8	0	I'll be back in a little while.	[]
Butters	10	0	Should I go see what he gets you again, Mom?	[]
Linda	22	0	I don't think Daddy's shopping. I think Daddy's going out wrestling again.  Paaiint.  Paaiint.  Must be made clean. New.	[]
Butters	20	0	Hey, a new paint brush. That's what Dad could get Mom for their anniversary. I gotta go tell him.	[]
Linda	16	0	Must clean Butters.  Clean. Never be clean. Must...  kill? The only way? Must kill Butters.  Paaiint.	[]
Choir	1	0	...Butters!	[]
Butters	3	0	That's me!	[]
Butters	2	0	One please.	[]
Attendant	3	0	Locker two thirteen!	[]
Butters	2	0	Uh thanks!	[]
Butters	5	0	Dad?  Dad, you in here?	[]
Butters	5	0	Hello? Eh-anybody in here?	[]
Man	6	0	There, do you think that works?	[]
Mr. Garrison	7	0	Well, that's four fingers; try five.	[]
Butters	3	0	Uh, Mr. Garrison?	[]
Mr. Garrison	3	0	...Who is that?!	[]
Butters	10	0	Da-ad? Da-ad??  Are you wrestlin' in here?  Dad?	[]
Mr. Slave	4	0	This room's taken.	[]
Butters	8	0	Oh, uh, pardon me, sirs.  Dad? No.  Hm.	[]
Chris	2	0	OOH! BUTTERS!	[]
Butters	2	0	Hi Dad!	[]
Chris	4	0	Oh God! Aaah! Ohhh!	[]
Butters	27	1	I'm glad I found ya. I think I know the perfect anniversary present for Mom. But what are you doin' with your wiener out there, Dad?	['wiener']
Chris	28	0	Butters, you need... to leave here right now! You need to... get out of here, egeh... Go home and wait for me to talk to talk to you.	[]
Butters	9	0	Oh. Well, alright then. Well, see ya at home.	[]
Chris	8	0	Oh, Jesus, no. OH, what have I done?	[]
Choir	5	0	Everyone knows it's Butters!	[]
Butters	3	0	That's me!	[]
Chris	14	0	Butters! Oh Butters! Could you come and see me in my study real quick?	[]
Butters	3	0	Uh, hey Dad.	[]
Chris	10	0	Come here, son.  I wanna have a talk with you.	[]
Butters	4	0	Well, sure thing, Dad.	[]
Chris	9	0	Son, I wanted to talk to you about lying.	[]
Butters	12	0	Well, I know lying's bad, Dad. Y-you told me so.	[]
Chris	25	0	Yes, it sure can be.  But, there are also times when distorting the truth a little, uh, is appropriate. These are called little white lies.	[]
Butters	3	0	Little white lies?	[]
Chris	27	1	You see, sometimes telling a little white lie is okay. Like, for instance, when you catch your father jacking off in a gay men's bath house.	['gay']
Butters	4	0	...Uh, who's Jack?	[]
Chris	23	0	Butters, the point is that, I think that if you told Mommy what Daddy was doing tonight, well, she might go completely insane.	[]
Butters	7	0	Oh no, that won't happen, Dad.	[]
Chris	5	0	It won't? Oh, good.	[]
Butters	11	0	Eh, no. Because I already told Mom and she's fine.	[]
Chris	2	0	You... what?	[]
Linda	11	0	Butters, Mommy wants to take you for a little drive now.	[]
Butters	14	0	A drive? Oh, boy!  I- I love a good drive. Is Dad comin' too?	[]
Linda	8	0	No, sweetie, Daddy needs to sit and think.	[]
Butters	11	0	Alright. See ya in a bit, Dad.  Oh boy, a drive!	[]
Butters	28	0	Oh, jeez, you wouldn't have believed how angry I was when Teacher said I had to share my fingerpaints, because I've been sharin' them all along.	[]
Linda	13	0	Butters, you know that Mommy loves you an awful lot, don't you?	[]
Butters	9	0	Well, sure I do, Mom. I love you, too.	[]
Linda	18	0	And sometimes mommies do things that seem hurtful to their babies, but it's really for the best.	[]
Butters	26	0	Oh, you mean like the time you washed my mouth out with soap for sayin' nutsack in front of Grandma. Yeah, I need to behave myself.	[]
Linda	25	0	If a mommy has to end her life, she can't let her baby alone in the world to be raised by a sick pervert.	[]
Butters	20	0	Well, sure, that makes sense, I suppose, yeah. Hey, did you seen my mittens anywhere?  It's cold out here.	[]
Linda	22	0	I'm going to get out of the car now, Butters.  I want you to stay put with your seat belt fastened.	[]
Butters	35	0	Oh. Well, alright, Mom. O-o-okay then.  You know, I think the car might be movin', Mom.  Yep, I'm pretty sure the car is movin'. Looks like I'm headin' for the water.	[]
Linda	13	0	Shhh. Shhh. It's okay, baby. Mommy will be with you very soon.	[]
Butters	33	0	Well, I think I- Yup, it looks like the car is fillin' up with water!  Yeah. I think right now might be a good time to try to get the car out, Mom!	[]
Choir	5	0	Everyone knows it's Butters!	[]
Butters	3	0	That's me!	[]
Linda	18	3	Dear bastard husband, No.  Dear lying sonofabitch, No.  Dear assface, Yeah, that's it. I will no longer-	['bastard', 'sonofabitch', 'assface']
Chris	5	0	Linda?? What are you doing??	[]
Linda	5	1	Stay away from me, bastard!	['bastard']
Chris	7	0	Linda, I know this is very hard-	[]
Linda	5	0	You don't know anything!	[]
Chris	19	0	I've been wanting to stop going to those places, Linda, but I couldn't. I still love you!	[]
Linda	4	0	Then why, Chris, why?!	[]
Chris	62	1	It just... it started as some curiosity on the Internet. I would chat with other married guys in the chat rooms and... Well the things they would talk about, Linda, I, I don't know why I found it exciting. I just did, and it, and it grew from there and it spun out of control, and- eh, ugh, DAMN YOU, INTERNET!	['damn']
Linda	15	0	Well,  you don't have to worry about your family being in your way anymore!	[]
Chris	44	0	No, Linda! I don't want that lifestyle! It's just kind of an addiction. I want help. And I'm going to get help. Please, just give me a chance to make this all up to you.  We can have a normal life!	[]
Linda	6	0	There is no going back, Chris!	[]
Chris	3	0	Sure there is!	[]
Linda	5	0	No!  Our son is dead!	[]
Chris	1	0	What?	[]
Linda	25	0	I killed him.  I was going to end it all, and everything spun out of control for me. I drowned Butters in the car, Chris!	[]
Chris	11	0	Oh no.  No! No, no, Jesus! Linda, what were you thinking?	[]
Linda	25	0	I WASN'T THINKING!  I couldn't think! You destroyed my life, you!  Oh, God, what have I done?! Oh, Butter-her-hers-ss-ss-	[]
Chris	10	0	This can't be happening! This is a bad dream.	[]
Linda	7	0	Just go away and let me die!	[]
Chris	3	0	No! Linda, we-	[]
Linda	12	0	I'm a murderer, Chris! I don't have a life now!	[]
Chris	32	0	Linda, Butters is gone.  Oh Christ, if Butters is gone, then... there's nothing we can do about that. But I won't let you go to jail, I promise, Linda! Pleeease!	[]
Butters	67	0	Oh, boy! This thing ain't never gonna stop! I must be all the way down to Denver by now.  Ohhh, whoopee! Finally. Uh now that the car has come to a stop, it's safe for me to unfasten my seat belt.  Boy, Mom must be- worried sick about- me right now. Ah I gotta get back home.  Wuh gee whiz, where the heck am I?	[]
Butters	3	0	That's me!	[]

Mechanic	109	0	'Aht road leads to Conifuh. You want to go to South Park, you gotta go down that rod.  'Course, I ain't nevuh seen anyone go up that rod. Six years ago a group of campers went up there and got lost. Had to eat each other to say alive. Used to be the way to O'Riley house. He butchered over fifty children and kept their bodies in a cellah. But, you should find an old bridge about halfway up. That bridge is cursed, you know? They built it with the bones of two hundred Chinese laborers who were massacred in '34. Yeah. Lotta history down that rod.	[]
Butters	21	0	...Well, it's my parents' anniversary tomorrow,  and they're gonna be awful sad if I'm not there with 'em.	[]
Mechanic	5	0	Well, uh good luck then.	[]
Butters	2	0	Oh jeez.	[]

Linda	2	0	Thank goodness.	[]
John Ramsey	3	0	Here he is.	[]
A Politician	2	0	John! Patsy!	[]
John Ramsey	40	0	Hello, Gary. Great to see you. Chris and Linda, this is our good friend, Congressman Gary Condit.  He also lost someone close to him and thinks it something to do with the same Puerto Rican guy that hurt our kids.	[]
Gary Condit	7	1	We're goin' tuh get that sonofabitch!	['sonofabitch']

Choir	5	0	Everyone knows it's Butters!	[]
Butters	3	0	That's me!	[]
Chris	22	0	Naw, Linda! Because you can't now say that the abductor is Costa Rican!  You have to learn to keep it straight!	[]
Linda	15	0	I can't keep it straight when you keep inventing new parts to the story!	[]
Chris	10	0	Hey, don't forget that I'm covering for you!	[]
Linda	8	0	Don't forget: your lies started all this.	[]
Chris	20	0	My lies may have been deceitful, but your lies cover up something much more horrible than anything I ever did!	[]
Butters	2	0	Happy Anniversary!	[]
Chris	3	0	Not now, Butters!	[]
Butters	4	0	Oh.  Alright, then. I-	[]
Linda	3	0	Butters?? Oh, Butters!	[]
Chris	6	0	Son! I don't believe it!	[]
Butters	27	0	Ah, I'm sorry. The car just rolled into the lake, and it floated all the way down the river. I tried callin' home, but it was-	[]
Linda	5	0	Oh, my baby's back!	[]
Butters	6	0	I ain't grounded, am I?	[]
Chris	27	0	No-huih, no, Butters. Oh, son, why...  Oh... Uh, we're gonna need you to tell a little white lie about where you've been though, alright?	[]
Butters	1	0	Lie?	[]
Linda	20	0	Oh. Eh yes. Uh darling, you're going to have to say you don't know how you got home.	[]
Chris	13	0	No! You have to say that a Puerto Rican man dropped you off!	[]
Linda	10	0	Ohhh, who's gonna believe he just dropped him off?!	[]
Butters	8	0	Hey, you stop hollerin'! It's your anniversary.	[]
Chris	10	0	Now we don't really have a choice, do we?!	[]
Linda	14	0	You're the one that made up the stuff about the Puerto Rican, IDIOT!	[]
Butters	6	0	Uh stop it, Mom and Dad.	[]
Chris	15	0	Well you're the one who couldn't back it up wit a description, stupid!	[]
Butters	95	0	Now gosh darn it, you!  You listen here! Now I am sick of these harmless lies and l-little white lies. You know, you can call a shovel an ice-cream machine, but it's still a shovel, Mom and Dad. Ah, and you can call a lie whatever you want, but it's still a no-good stinkin' lie! And when you start coverin' up one lie with another why, now that's when you get into real trouble!  Boy I've, I've just about had it up to here  with you two!	[]
Chris	7	0	...Butters... You're as right as rain.	[]
Linda	3	0	You sure are.	[]
Butters	12	0	Well I ain't in trouble for hollerin' at ya, am I?	[]
Linda	19	0	No, Butters. You're the best son in the whole world.  And I am so happy you're alive.	[]
Butters	18	0	...Well ah, I'm happy you're alive too, Mom. So now can we go to Bennigan's?	[]
Chris	14	0	You bet, son. But Mommy and Daddy have something they have to do first.	[]
Chris	14	0	We... have an announcement to make, um. Our son has been returned to us.	[]
Man in Crowd	2	0	Wow, alright	[]
Stan	3	0	Butters was missing?	[]
Chris	30	0	But, that isn't all we have to say. You see, we learned a very important lesson tonight and it took the smarts of our young son to show us.	[]
Butters	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Linda	22	0	We've learned that deception is wrong and that the only thing to ever make it right again is to come clean.	[]
Butters	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Chris	29	2	You see, I've been deceiving my wife for several months. I was going to gay movies and bathhouses and having sex with random men who were complete strangers.	['gay', 'sex']
Butters	3	0	Ye-!  wait, what?	[]
Cartman	1	0	Huho!	[]
Linda	22	0	And when I found out I went crazy, I went crazy and I drove my son into the lake to kill 'im.	[]
Butters	7	0	Uh, k-kill me? Uh Jesus Christ!	[]
Stan	2	1	Damn, dude.	['damn']
Chris	233	3	So you see, there was no Some Puerto Rican Guy. He doesn't exist. And so the people we owe the biggest apology to are the Ramseys, Congressman Condit, and O.J. We gave you false hope for finding the person who hurt those close to you and, we're sorry. Now we're just happy we won't have to live a life of secrets. For I knew that even though some of you supported us, some others were looking at me and thinking, You're a liar! You're a LIAR!  You know somethin' that you're not telling us, you slimy, scumbag liar!  Eh you know, that's what people would say to me. And then people would see my wife at the supermarket and they would say, Hello, but they'd be thinking, Ah, there goes that MURDERER!  You got away with MURDER you murdering, lying, waste of life!  And to me, people might say things like,  LIAR! Tell us what you know you God-damned liar!  And so, to both of us, people all over town would be saying things like,  You know God-damn well what happened to your kid, so stop acting like victims, and confess, you MURDERING MURDERERS!  CONFESS!  LIAR! CONFESS!  You know, and, that's what people would be saying to us, and so, we just had to come forward and tell the truth.	['scumbag', 'damned', 'damn']
