Stan	13	0	Hey, Cartman, how come your costume has like, nose rings and facial hair?	[]
Cartman	23	0	'Cause I'm like, you know, the tough one. Every boy band has to have the one member that, you know, is tough.	[]
Kyle	6	0	I wanna be the tough one.	[]
Cartman	13	0	...Kyle, you are the sweet one. Will you please just cooperate and not--	[]
Kyle	6	0	I wanna be the tough one!	[]
Cartman	10	1	You can't be the tough one, you're Jewish!	['jewish']

Cartman	2	0	Since when?!	[]
Kyle	3	0	Since Abraham, fatass!	[]
Cartman	16	0	Alright, fine! Here!  Jesus Christ, I wonder if every boy band has to go through this!	[]
Stan	7	0	Hey, Cartman, what does fingerbang mean, anyways?	[]
Cartman	22	0	I heard it on HBO. It means, like, you know, when you...  pretend to use your finger like a gun or something.	[]
Kenny	9	0	(Hm hm, noho, that's not what it means.)	[]
Stan	8	0	Kenny says that's not what it means.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Okay, Kenny, what does fingerbang mean, then?	[]
Kenny	22	1	(It's when you take your finger, and you stick it in a vagina and you stick it in again and again.)	['vagina']
Cartman	27	1	...What?! Who the hell would do that?! Jesus Christ! Grow up Kenny, would you?! Alright, boys, let's do it from the top. 1, 2, 3, 4!	['hell']
Veteran Guard	43	0	Now, I know that this is your first day on the job of mall security, rookie. Keepin' the law in a mall is just like any tough city, and especially because they don't let us have guns. It can be very dangerous.	[]
Cartman	17	0	Alright, guys. Let's do it like we rehearsed! We need energy! We need to be up!	[]
Veteran Guard	10	0	Excuse me, just where do you think you're goin'?	[]

Stan	13	0	Well, I guess we can't get in to see the mall manager.	[]
Cartman	20	1	The hell we can't! I'm not lettin' no washed-up law cops ruin my divine quest! Come on!	['hell']
Veteran Guard	5	0	Ey!  What are you doin'?	[]

Manager	11	0	What? O-oh. You wanna play at the mall? Like Tiffany?	[]
Cartman	8	0	Sort of like Tiffany, yes. Can we audition?	[]
Manager	5	0	Oh. Well, I guess. ...What?	[]
Cartman	6	0	Alright! Let's do it, boys!	[]
Fingerbang	28	0	I'm gonna fingerbang-bang you into my life Girl, you like to fingerbang, and it's alright I'm goin' to fingerbang-bang you ever-y night	[]
Cartman	23	0	And girl you know you're cool, you're good, you're so much nicer, girl You're good, You're gonna be--	[]
Manager	4	0	Alright, that's enough!	[]
Cartman	6	0	--you're my fantasy, you fanta--	[]
Manager	2	0	Thank you.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Well, so can we play here?	[]
Manager	2	0	What?? ...No.	[]
Cartman	1	0	No??	[]
Manager	2	0	Who?? No!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Why not?!	[]
Manager	36	0	Well uh, uh, oh... Right now there's a cheese and sausage cart in the plaza. And I would uh, I'd hate to have to move it off to the side for a while. What?	[]
Cartman	10	0	You don't think we're any good, do you?!	[]
Manager	13	0	No. I mean, you're just not as good as sausage and cheese.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Well, come on guys. We gave it our best.	[]
Manager	5	0	Wow. That was your best?	[]
Kyle	5	0	Wow. I feel so rejected.	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Veteran Guard	18	0	There you are! You're the hoodlums who got on the intercom and started an orange smoothie riot!	[]
Stan	2	0	Uh-oh.	[]
Veteran Guard	21	0	I will now read you your mall rights! You have the right to shop at a variety of malls in all--	[]
Kyle	3	0	Run for it!	[]
Veteran Guard	4	0	Go get 'em, rookie!	[]
Randy	3	0	Where is Stan?	[]
Sharon	13	0	Oh, he's over at Eric's house practicing for his boy band.	[]
Randy	9	0	What?! I specifically told him not to do that!	[]
Sharon	18	0	Now, Randy, calm down. It's just a silly little dream. They're not gonna actually make it.	[]
Randy	23	0	And what if they do make it, Sharon? What if they do make it? Are you gonna be the one to tell 'im?!	[]
Shelly	7	1	Mom, what's up Dad's ass?	['ass']
Sharon	20	1	It's a long story, Shelly. Let's just say your father... has a lot up his ass right now.	['ass']
Chef	5	0	Oh! Oh-h, hello Eric.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Problem, Chef. I have m-many problems.	[]
Chef	21	0	Wellll, if you uhhh, come back in just a little bit, Eric, I'll see if I can help you out.	[]
Cartman	20	0	I just don't know what I'm gonna do.  Sometimes I wonder if God isn't toying with me.	[]
Chef	6	0	Alright, Eric, what's the matter?	[]
Cartman	42	0	Chef, God told me I was to start a boy band and make $10 million dollars. The problem is, it isn't working. I mean,  I feel the music burning inside me. But I just can't express it right, you know?	[]
Chef	37	0	Well, Eric, I, I think you were just focusin' in on the wrong thing. Boy bands aren't about music, boy bands are created by corporations to make money. They're all based on the Gomlich effect.	[]
Cartman	5	0	What's the Gomlich effect?	[]
Chef	33	0	The law of physics that states, If one girl screams for something, it will make other girls scream. And then, it grows exponentiously until all girls within a five-mile radius are screaming.	[]
Cartman	7	0	So how do boy bands use that?	[]
Chef	37	0	All they do is make videos, showing tons and tons of girls screaming for the boy band. Once you get girls screaming, you can't stop 'em. They're crazy!  Uh-uh, except for Lilian, of course.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Thanks!	[]
Chef	6	0	You're welcome. Now, go away!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Okay.	[]
Chef	10	0	A-and a cucumber in the pants never hurt either!	[]
Cartman	6	0	Cucumber in the pants. Got it.	[]
Cartman	48	0	Alright, everybody, listen up! This is how this first shot is gonna work: The girls are standing here, and then the members of the band walk by looking cool. When you see us, you girls all scream like, Oh my God, it's Fingerbang! Oh my God! Okay?	[]
Bebe	8	0	Are we gonna get paid now, or after?	[]
Cartman	10	0	I'll pay you afterwards. Promise. Okay, Timmy, roll camera.	[]
Timmy	1	0	Tiimmmaaayyy!	[]
Kyle	7	0	Dude, what's wrong with your leg?	[]
Cartman	14	0	Huh? Oh, Chef says to put a cucumber down my pants for good luck.	[]
Girls	4	0	Ahhh. Wow. Woohoo. Yay.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Waitwaitwaitwait, cut!	[]
Timmy	1	0	Huhaaaaah!	[]
Cartman	18	0	Let's go crazier than that! I mean, you have to act like it's freakin' Leonardo DiCaprio!	[]
Bebe	15	1	We wouldn't give a rat's ass if Leonardo DiCaprio came walking past us.	['ass']
Other Girls	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Fine! Who would you go crazy for?	[]
Girls	2	0	...Matt Lauer.	[]
Cartman	8	0	...Okay, fine! Pretend that we're Matt Lauer.	[]
Bebe	2	0	Oh... Okay.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Roll camera!	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmuh!	[]
Girls	1	0	AAAGGGGHHH!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Jesus Christ!	[]
Fingerbang	6	0	Fingerbang-bang you ever-y night	[]
Cartman	28	0	Aaand cut!  Alright, our video's complete. Through the grace of God I can now go back to that mall manager and show him what we've got!	[]
Bebe	6	0	Okay, so where's our money?	[]
Cartman	5	0	Oh uh, Kyle has it.	[]
Randy	7	1	Stanley, what the hell are you doing?	['hell']
Stan	6	0	We are making a music video.	[]
Randy	7	0	You get in the truck right now!	[]
Stan	5	0	Dad, I was just a--	[]
Randy	4	0	Get in the truck!	[]
Stan	14	0	Dad, I did all my chores. Why can't I play with my friends?	[]
Randy	29	0	Stanley, it's just that there's better things you could be doing on a Saturday than singing and dancing. You could be watching TV or, laying in bed.	[]
Stan	13	0	Dad, I like being in a boy band. I think it's interesting.	[]
Randy	15	1	Well, there's plenty of other interesting you can do. Have you ever tried marijuana?	['marijuana']
Stan	1	0	No.	[]
Randy	5	0	Well, maybe it's time.	[]
Stan	1	0	Dad!	[]
Veteran Guard	5	0	Ey! What are you doin'?	[]
Madman	18	0	I've got a new strain of anthrax that I will soon unleash upon all of North America!	[]
Veteran Guard	3	0	Move along, sir.	[]
Madman	1	0	Wuh?	[]
Cartman	20	0	Attention, shoppers: There are naked people at the orange smoothie machine. There are naked people at the orange smoothie machine.	[]
Veteran Guard	2	1	God damnit!	['damnit']
Cartman	2	0	Hello again!	[]
Manager	10	0	What? Oh. It's you. I don't like you.	[]
Cartman	14	0	I know you didn't love our audition. But now we have a video.	[]
Manager	2	0	Oh. What?	[]
Cartman	12	0	If you would, sir, just watch this and prepare to be wowed!	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmiihh!	[]
Cartman	17	1	Uh, god damnit..! Our camera guy kinda sucks, but this next shot we did was really cool.	['damnit']
Timmy	5	0	Haaghh.  Timmih, livin' a lie!	[]
Cartman	4	1	Son of a bitch!	['bitch']
Manager	5	0	Hey. This video is dumb.	[]
Cartman	21	0	You don't understand. Girls were going crazy for it. Please. This is what God want me to do. Ple-ease.	[]
Manager	22	0	Alright alright. What? Well, I guess I can move the sausage and cheese cart off to one side.  For a little while.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Really? You will?	[]
Manager	5	0	Only for twenty minutes, though.	[]
Cartman	13	0	That's all we need! How about this afternoon at 3 o'clock?	[]
Manager	2	0	Oh. Okay.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Yes! Thank you sir, you will not be disappointed!	[]
Mr. Mackey	11	0	Oh, Mrs. Cartman, I've been uh very bad. M'kay?	[]
Liane	14	0	You have been bad, so you're gonna have to drink from this glass.	[]
Mr. Mackey	8	0	Oh, yeah, that makes me hot, m'kay?	[]
Cartman	2	0	Aw, Mom!	[]
Manager	2	0	Wow. What?	[]
Stan	14	0	It's not fair, Dad! Why can't I be in a boy band?	[]
Randy	4	0	Because I said so!	[]
Stan	23	0	Dad, Cartman said we're gonna perform at the mall at 3 o'clock. My friends are gonna be pissed off at me.	[]
Randy	6	0	Let 'em be pissed off, then!	[]
Stan	17	0	I don't understand! Just let me go do this one thing, and I won't ever--	[]
Randy	2	0	No!!  NOOO!!	[]
Stan	7	1	Dad? What the hell is going on?	['hell']
Randy	44	0	...I was... I was 18 when my high-school men's choir performed at the grand opening of a sporting-goods store in Denver.  I was just one of fifteen members and I had no idea that a record producer was in the audience.	[]
Producer	6	0	Kid, can I talk to you?	[]
Randy	2	0	Uh sure.	[]
Producer	18	0	Heh, you were really great up there. Too good for a pissant choir in a pissant mountain town.	[]
Randy	2	0	Ohh, thanks.	[]
Producer	24	0	Listen: I'm putting together a rock group. A vocal group called the Ghetto Avenue Boys. I think you would make a perfect member.	[]
Randy	9	0	What? Me? Do you like my singing that much?	[]
Producer	21	0	Yeah, I think your mustache is perfect. How would you like to come to New York and start a singing career?	[]
Randy	19	0	Oh my God, I don't know. I mean, I still have another year of high school, and I--	[]
Producer	12	0	Hey, look, if you don't want it, I'll keep looking--	[]
Randy	10	0	No! Wait. I mean, ah-I'll think about it.	[]
Producer	11	0	I take it that means yes. Call me in the morning.	[]
Randy	13	0	And just like that I left everything. I dropped out of high school...	[]
Randy	2	0	See ya.	[]
Randy	7	0	...I said good-bye to my girlfriend...	[]
Randy	2	0	See ya.	[]
Randy	5	0	...And I left my family.	[]
Randy	2	0	See ya.	[]
Randy	20	0	And suddenly there I was, thrown into a group with four other young men who I didn't even know.	[]
Producer	2	0	Take 112!	[]
Ghetto Avenue Boys	16	0	You've... got... it! You know you've got... it What you've got is it!	[]
Randy	6	0	It's obvious to me, girl	[]
Randy	27	0	The songs were terrible. But believe it or not, the country ate them up. The next thing I knew, we were the biggest thing in the world.	[]
Ghetto Avenue Boys	18	0	Shirl! You've... got... it! It... is what you've got, girl! What you've got is it!	[]
Randy	6	0	Now, give it to me, 'cause...	[]
Randy	23	0	I had everything. A huge house,  and all the women you can imagine.  And then one day, just as quick as it started...	[]
Mr. Allens	9	0	Alright, guys, let's take it from the top.	[]
Randy	3	0	Hey, Mr. Allens.	[]
Mr. Allens	5	0	Heh? Woh. Uh... R-Randy.	[]
Randy	3	0	Who are they?	[]
Mr. Allens	11	0	These are the Avenue Ghetto Street Boys, my... new boy band.	[]
Randy	8	0	But, w-we're still selling records, right?	[]
Mr. Allens	15	0	Look, kid, you're just getting a little... old to be in a boy band.	[]
Randy	3	0	I'm 19.	[]
Mr. Allens	13	0	Get a life, Marsh!  Alright, guys, let's take it from the top.	[]
Randy	22	0	They said that after all the money we had made we were in debt to the studio, so they towed my car...	[]
Tow Truck Driver	2	0	See ya.	[]
Randy	4	0	...the women all left...	[]
Women	2	0	See ya.	[]
Randy	6	0	...and they took back my house.	[]
Randy	1	0	Ugh..!	[]
Mr. Allens	2	0	See ya.	[]
Randy	18	0	The only thing I could do was come back to Colorado, and face everyone that I had abandoned.	[]
Woman	15	0	Hey! Weren't you the guy in that stupid boy band, the Ghetto Avenue Boys?	[]
Man	12	0	Sure, I remember you!  You got it, baby... You got it, baby	[]
Randy	13	0	And so you see, Stanley, I... do know what I'm talking about.	[]
Stan	5	0	Jesus Christ. ...I never knew.	[]
Randy	139	0	I didn't want you to know. Because now I'm a joke. Ever since then, I've wished every single day that I could go back to that moment when I was offered the job and say, No! Because all the fame and the money, the women... All it did was build me up, so that I could be knocked down harder than anybody in the world.  That is what being in a boy band is all about, Stanley.  It's people smothering you and embracing you and loving you and then spitting you out and throwing you away like you were last night's pork chops. Now we wander the Earth in disarray-us, New Kids on the Block, the Osmonds... We're all the same. And that... is why you can't go to the mall.	[]
Stan	2	0	...Oh-kay.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Wow. There must be at least 20 people out there.	[]
Cartman	5	1	Where the hell is Stan?!	['hell']
Kyle	8	1	He'll be here. Stan wouldn't douche.	['douche']

Cartman	13	0	Yes. Yes, sir, any second-we're just waiting on one more member.	[]

Randy	41	0	Come here, Stanley.  Stan, it was wrong of me to try and stop you from joining a boy band without explaining why. I've made some mistakes in my life, and now... I have to let you make your own mistakes.	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Randy	22	0	You know, in a way, I think I was even jealous of you being in a boy band. Isn't that stupid?	[]

Manager	3	0	Sorry. Get out!	[]
Cartman	26	1	Well God, I guess you got me again, didn't you? Hyeah, that was a good one, God. Hope it made you laugh, you sick bastard.	['bastard']
Wendy	3	0	What's that?	[]
Kyle	3	0	It's Stan!	[]

Manager	8	0	Who? Well. Okay, I guess. But hurry up.	[]
Cartman	50	1	We will!  Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to witness the next great boy band of the country! Someday you will all be among those who can say, I saw Fingerbang when they first performed at some crappy little mall.  And so, without further ado, all five members of the...	['crappy']
Kenny	1	0	(Uff--!)	[]
Stan	6	0	Oh my God, they killed Kenny!	[]
Kyle	2	1	You bastards!	['bastards']

Kyle	5	0	Dude, he's pretty dead.	[]
Cartman	5	0	No! We were so close!	[]
Manager	7	0	Alright, that's it, kids. Get out!	[]
Cartman	5	0	But we have to perform!	[]
Kyle	8	0	We don't have a fifth member, Cartman!	[]
Stan	4	0	Oh, yes we do.	[]
Cartman	12	0	Thank you all for your patience, and now get ready for Fingerbang!	[]

Cartman	6	0	Chuh!  Yes! Yes! Thank you, yes!	[]
Kyle	4	0	We made two dollars.	[]
Stan	4	0	You were great, Dad.	[]
Randy	11	0	Yeah. I guess I still got it in me a little.	[]
Little Girl	5	0	Can I get your autograph?	[]
Cartman	3	0	Ok-Okay, okay.	[]
Veteran Guard	8	0	Hey, don't hassle the talent, ma'am.	[]
Little Girl	21	0	I actually don't really know who they are, I was just getting an autograph and--  A-a-agg-g-ggh!	[]

Cartman	14	0	Okay, yeah, maybe.  God..! Now it's like everybody wants a piece of us.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Cartman	61	0	I don't know if I can handle all this fame. I mean, I always thought I'd wanna become famous, but now that I am, I don't know if I like it. I mean, I probably can't even walk through this mall right now without people goin', Oh my God, it's the Fingerbang guy! Oh my God!	[]
Kyle	5	0	...Yeah. That's gonna suck.	[]
Stan	18	0	Yeah. I just wanna be a normal kid again. Have a normal life and appreciate what I have.	[]
Randy	21	0	Well, I think you boys are very smart for your age. Come on. I'll buy you all an orange smoothie.	[]
Stan	8	0	I don't think they sell those anymore.	[]
Kyle	16	0	Hey, Cartman, do you think God's getting mad at you for not making $10 million?	[]
Cartman	21	1	Aw, screw God. I'm not scared o' him. He's a pussy.  You know I'm just kiddin', right? Heheyeah.	['pussy']
