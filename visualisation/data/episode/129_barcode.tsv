Cartman	11	0	Mom! Mom! Get up, we have to go!  MOM, GET UP!	[]
Liane	7	0	Oh, Poopie-kins, it's very early.	[]
Cartman	29	0	Mom, I told you! The new Sony PSP game machines go on sale at seven a.m. today. I have to be the first to get one!  Come on!	[]
Liane	7	0	Sweetie, can't we go after school?	[]
Cartman	25	0	Everyone's moms are taking their kids after school! We're outsmarting everyone by getting to the store right when it opens! Let's go!	[]
Cartman	35	1	I can't wait to see the look on everyone's faces when I show up to school with a PSP! I wonder if Kyle will cry? Oh PLEASE let Kyle cry!  What the hell?!	['hell']
Cartman	6	0	Kenny, when did you get here?	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Friday)	[]
Cartman	13	0	Friday?! Aw, Jesus!  I'll just... sort of get in here- in here.	[]
Tall Goth	9	1	Hey dickhole! What do you think you're doing?	['dickhole']
Cartman	10	0	Uh, my friend Kenny was saving my place in line.	[]
Sixth Grader	17	0	There's no saving place, fourthie! Get to the back or we'll beat your face in!	[]
Cartman	8	1	Oh, Goddammit!  They'd better not sell out!	['goddammit']
Kyle	12	0	That thing is pretty cool. What games did you get with it?	[]
Stan	25	1	It's a game called Heaven versus Hell. Kenny commands the armies of heaven against the forces of Satan.  Dude, you see what Kenny got?	['hell']
Cartman	7	0	YES YES, I KNOW! UP YOURS, KYLE!	[]
Kyle	5	0	Wuh what'd I do?	[]
Cartman	5	1	JUST SHUT YOUR JEW MOUTH!	['jew']
Game Voice	6	0	Congratulations! You have reached ...level nine!	[]
Kyle	12	2	Wow, level nine already? Dude, you kick ass in Heaven versus Hell.	['ass', 'hell']
Stan	10	0	Yeah, Kenny finally found something he's really good at.	[]
Mrs. McCormick	21	0	Kenny? Kenny, are you still playin' with that thing?  Kenny, it's been two weeks and you've done nothin' else!	[]
Kenny	6	0	(I could get to level sixty!)	[]
Mrs. McCormick	47	0	Who cares if you almost made it to level sixty?! You're wastin' your life, Kenny! If you died tomorrow, what would you have to show for it?! You're gonna end up wishin' you'd done more with your life, just like your dead-beat father!	[]
Stuart	5	1	Hey, I heard that, bitch!	['bitch']
Mrs. McCormick	7	1	I wasn't talkin' to you, asshole!!	['asshole']
Stuart	11	0	How about I come in there and kick your teeth in!	[]
Mrs. McCormick	7	0	I'd like to see you try!	[]
Stuart	13	1	Goddamnit, do you have to smart off at me in my own house?!	['goddamnit']
Mrs. McCormick	9	0	It's my house too, you no-good loser!	[]
Game Voice	5	0	You have reached level sixty!	[]
Kenny	9	0	(Yes! Woohoo! I did it! I reached level s-!)	[]
Driver	5	0	Oh yeah, level four, sweet!	[]
Kenny	14	0	(Hey, that's odd.)  (Hey, I'm floating. That can't be! Hey wait!)	[]
Angel 1	3	0	Open the gate!	[]
Angel 2	3	0	Open the gate!	[]
Peter	10	0	Welcome to the Kingdom of Heaven, Kenny. I am Peter.	[]
Kenny	6	1	(What the fuck is going on?)	['fuck']
Peter	18	0	There isn't much time, Kenny. You're dead, but, your death was no accident. Heaven needs you.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Me?)	[]
Peter	76	1	Come! There is much to discuss.  Things are not good in Heaven, Kenny. Satan is planning a massive attack and he knows we are too few in number to stop him! God has changed the rules here. For ages, only Mormons were allowed into Heaven.  But knowing that Hell was becoming much larger, God decided to let more people cross over so that he could build an army as well, an army that YOU must command.	['hell']
Kenny	3	0	(That I what?)	[]
Peter	34	0	The Sony PSP was built by God, to determine who on Earth had the best skills to defeat the armies of Satan. You... are the best. YOU, are the only hope for the universe.	[]
Angel 3	27	0	Satan's army grows as we speak. The Dark Lord knows that our armies are few in number, and unorganized. So our only hope... is perfect strategy.	[]
Angel 4	7	0	A child? This is God's solution?	[]
Peter	11	0	He beat Satan's army in over three thousand separate simulations.	[]
Angel 4	5	0	Archangel Michael, what say you?	[]
Michael	100	1	The child did something none of us could: Reach level sixty on the PSP. Now I don't know if that's luck or perseverance, but it's Goddamned impressive. All right, Kenny, let me show you what we're up against.  This is the Kingdom of Heaven. Satan's armies will attack the gate ...here. They are... ten billion in number. Maybe more.  Our armies are here, here, and here. Just under... ten thousand strong.  We are outnumbered and in need of someone who can single handedly bring the whole Dark Empire down. Basically, Kenny, you... are Keanu Reeves.	['goddamned']
Satan	29	1	My fellow damned souls! Now is the time for our assault!  You know no fear! You will drink the blood of angels! We go now! Nothing can stop us!	['damned']
Angel 5	13	0	Step aside! Step aside, I say!  Satan! God has mocked thee once again!	[]
Satan	2	0	My spy!	[]
Angel 5	9	0	God has found a way to defeat your army.	[]
Satan	2	0	Impossible! How?!	[]
Angel 5	10	0	A young man. Basically, he-he's like Keanu Reeves.	[]
Satan	3	0	Oh Jesus Christ.	[]
Hooded Figure	8	0	My Lord. My Lord, we must attack, now!	[]
Satan	10	0	What's the point?! They have a Keanu Reeves now.	[]
Hooded Figure	9	0	Do not fear, my Lord. Your army is great!	[]
Satan	9	0	Very well.  Demon Army, begin your march on Heaven!	[]
Michael	25	0	Up here, you get the best tactical view to protect the fortress. It is from here, Kenny, that you shall command the armies of heaven.	[]
Kenny	9	0	(All right. How am I supposed to do that?)	[]
Angel 6	5	0	Simple. You will use... this.	[]
Michael	8	0	This golden PSP is king of all PSPs.	[]
Angels	4	0	Hail the holy PSP.	[]
Michael	42	0	It works just like the ones we sent to Earth. All the commands you make will be sent to the troops down on the battlefield. All you have to do is play the game, Kenny. Only this time, It's for reals.	[]
Angel 7	4	0	Gabriel returns with news!	[]
Gabriel	13	1	Hell's army is departing! They head now for the Gates of Heaven.	['hell']
Michael	44	1	Prepare the troops!  We must be ready for them!  The time is at hand, Kenny. The stage is set and the final battle between Heaven and Hell is about to begin! The fate of the outcome is in your hands.  Where'd he go?	['hell']
Female Nurse	6	0	Doctor! Doctor, we have a pulse!	[]
The Doctor	8	0	Then that's it! We brought him back.	[]
Male Nurse	15	0	Amazing, doctor! You've revived somebody who's been legally dead for almost a day!	[]
The Doctor	16	0	Call the parents. They're going to be shocked to find out... their son is alive.	[]
The Doctor	16	0	It's the latest in electro-plastilical science. Your son's organs are all functioning again.	[]
Stuart	8	0	It's a miracle... Kenny, you're alive.	[]
The Doctor	40	0	I'm afraid he can't respond to you. You see, being dead for that long, most of Kenny's brain cells died from lack of oxygen. Your son is alive, but, in what we call a persistent vegetative state.	[]
Mrs. McCormick	4	0	Will he ever recover?	[]
The Doctor	44	0	I'm afraid no. Brain cells cannot be repaired once dead. But his soul is still in here.  Almost... trapped in here, if you will. Kenny is the same as he ever was. It's just that, now, he's more like ...a tomato.	[]
Stuart	12	0	He can't more on his own-ah how will he eat?	[]
The Doctor	25	0	A feeding tube. It pumps a nutrient paste directly into Kenny's stomach. With it we can actually keep Kenny the tomato alive for years.	[]
Michael	3	0	A feeding tube?!	[]
Gabriel	10	0	Yes. Apparently they're using machines to keep them alive.	[]
Michael	15	0	But... that's not natural. God intended Kenny to die! What are these people doing?!	[]
Angel 3	22	0	The child's soul is now trapped inside his vegetative body. We have no one to command the troops with the PSP.	[]
Gabriel	6	0	And Satan's armies are approaching.	[]
Michael	2	1	Oh, Goddammit.	['goddammit']
Lawyer	16	0	Boys I want to thank you for coming down to my office on such short notice.	[]
Stan	6	0	Are we in trouble or something?	[]
Lawyer	22	0	No. Boys, I'm a lawyer. Your friend Kenny has passed away and I've called you here to read his will.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Kenny had a will?	[]
Lawyer	33	0	In the highly likely event of my death, I, Kenny McCormick, wish to leave all my belongings to my good friends, Stan and Kyle. Dudes, you were the friends a guy could have.	[]
Stan	2	0	Oh wow...	[]
Kyle	4	0	That's... really touching.	[]
Cartman	3	1	(looking bored) Fags!	['fags']
Lawyer	45	0	To Eric Cartman: Eric, I never really liked you. But then, nobody does. You have no ability to feel, and you are going to die alone and miserable. It is only because I feel so sorry for you that I leave you my Sony PSP.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Oh yeah! Oh yeah, baby! Who the man? Who the man?	[]
Lawyer	31	0	There is one more thing I would like to ask you all, as my friends. If I should ever be in a vegetative state and kept alive on life-support, please,...	[]
Stan	2	0	Please what?	[]
Lawyer	9	0	I don't know. I lost the last page.	[]
Cartman	14	0	Who cares? Kenny's dead!  When do I take possession of my PSP, sir?	[]
Lawyer	14	0	It's right here, along with Kenny's other belongings. They're all yours.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Yes!	[]
Man	3	0	He's alive!	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Man	8	0	Kenny McCormick! He's alive at the hospital!	[]
Kyle	3	0	Oh my God!	[]
Hooded Figure	9	0	Your army nears the Kingdom of Heaven, my Lord.	[]
Satan	17	0	I don't know if we should continue without knowing more about this Keanu Reeves God has.	[]
Spy Angel	22	0	Satan! I come bearing good news! The Keanu Reeves boy has been revived on Earth! His soul is no longer in Heaven.	[]
Satan	14	0	Then God is helpless.  Full march, to the Gates of Heaven! Victory is ours!	[]
Stan	1	0	Kenny?	[]
Kyle	4	0	Kenny! You're alive!	[]
Stan	6	0	Dude, how'd you do that?	[]
The Doctor	18	0	He can't respond to you, boys. Being dead for that long caused severe damage to his brain.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Well... well then he's NOT alive.	[]
Mrs. McCormick	13	0	He's alive. He-ee smiles when I talk to him. I think...	[]
Cartman	20	0	That's not Kenny. Kenny sniffs paint and sets things on fire! Here, look.  Kenny, Kenny look. Want a dollar?	[]
Stuart	27	0	I-I don't know if it's right to keep Kenny alive on that machine. I-I just... I don't know what he would want.	[]
Stan	6	0	Yeah, the lawyer lost that page.	[]
Cartman	21	0	Oh, I just remembered! Kenny told me this one time, that he wouldn't wanna be kept alive via feeding tube.	[]
Mrs. McCormick	3	0	He did? When?	[]
Cartman	7	0	Um, it was um, this one time...	[]
Kyle	17	0	He did not say that! You just want him dead so you can have his stupid PSP!	[]
Cartman	39	0	Stupid? PSP is stupid?!  Did you all hear that?  Uh I mean, I mean this isn't about PSP, Kyle! This is about my friend, and his wishes. And Kenny said he didn't want to live like this!	[]
Kyle	3	0	He did not!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Did so!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Did not!	[]
Cartman	29	1	Fine! We'll see about this, you freakin' Jew!  I'm gonna get that feeding tube removed if I have to go all the way to the Supreme Court!	['jew']
Peter	10	0	Satan's army has crossed over the Plains of Limbo!	[]
Gabriel	23	0	Then they will be here on the morrow. Without Kenny's soul here there will be nobody who can use the holy PSP.	[]
Uriel	14	0	No! There is another. A Japanese boy did make it to level fifty-nine.	[]
Michael	10	0	Are you stupid, Uriel? Japanese people don't have souls!	[]
Angel 9	1	0	Yeah	[]
Angel 10	1	0	Yeah	[]
Angel 11	1	0	Yeah	[]
Angel 12	2	0	Yeah, Uriel!	[]
Uriel	6	0	Oh, right right, I'm sorry	[]
Michael	67	1	Kenny remains our only hope! Here is what we must do.  Gabriel and Uriel, you go down to Earth and try to get that feeding tube removed. In the meantime  we will put all our troops at Heaven's Gate. We will try to keep Hell's Army from breaking through as long as possible.  Hopefully, it will be long enough to get our Keanu Reeves back.	['hell']
Cartman	42	0	You see your honor, I was the only one that Kenny McCormick told his wishes to. And Kenny told me specifically that he would never want to be kept alive on a machine. What they're doing to him ...is not right.	[]
Chief Justice	24	0	Well I'm sorry, young man, but the parents want their child kept alive. I don't believe you have any legal authority here.	[]
Cartman	14	0	I do have legal authority, your honor. You see, I was Kenny's... BFF.	[]
Judge 2	3	0	Best friends forever?	[]
Cartman	36	0	That's right. Kenny and I have been BFFs since first grade. Here, look.  Kenny has the other half of this BFF necklace. I believe you all know what that means, and how serious this is.	[]
Mrs. McCormick	10	0	Look, Kenny, your friends are here to visit you again.	[]
The Doctor	7	0	But this just doesn't seem right.	[]
Stuart	6	0	Wha, what's the matter, doctor?	[]
The Doctor	16	0	I'm afraid I've been given a court order to remove Kenny's feeding tube.	[]
Mrs. McCormick	1	0	What?	[]
Cartman	5	0	He's right in here.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Cartman!	[]
Chief Justice	23	0	Kenny's BFF says that Kenny didn't want to be kept alive artificially. The courts have determined we must obey his wish.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Cartman is NOT Kenny's BFF!	[]
Police Officer	6	0	Sir, take a look at this.	[]
Chief Justice	12	0	That's all the verification we need. Pull the feeding tube, doctor.	[]
Mrs. McCormick	5	0	No doctor! You can't!	[]
The Doctor	7	0	I'm sorry. I have no choice.	[]
Gabriel	4	0	Here is the hospital	[]
Uriel	20	0	This is hopeless, Gabriel. We cannot interact with anything on Earth, how could we possibly get a feeding tube removed?	[]
Kyle	5	1	That dirty no-good sonofabitch!	['sonofabitch']
Stan	15	0	Now that Cartman got Kenny's feeding tube out, he's gonna die for sure!	[]
Gabriel	5	0	The tube has been removed?	[]
Kyle	12	0	How can they let an eight-year-old decide Kenny's fate?	[]
Uriel	10	0	Apparently, some blessed child has done our work for us.	[]
Gabriel	18	0	Good. Now all we must do is pray nobody interferes with the child's death a second time.	[]
Kyle	16	0	Dude, we have to do whatever we can to get that feeding tube put back in!	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Gabriel	1	0	No!	[]
Stan	20	0	Let's go to the, uh, media. We'll make everyone in the country know that they're killing Kenny.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Yeah, come on!	[]
Uriel	6	1	No! No, no boys! Aw Goddammit!	['goddammit']
Anchor	41	0	This is HBC News. A right-to-die case debate is heating up in Colorado,  where Kenny McCormick's feeding tube has been removed by his BFF.  Two boys are bringing national attention to this story by protesting outside the hospital.	[]
Stan	4	0	Don't kill Kenny!	[]
All	2	1	You bastards!	['bastards']
Stan	4	0	Don't kill Kenny!	[]
All	2	1	You bastards!	['bastards']
Uriel	12	0	No! No, they're not killing him, they're letting him die!	[]
Skeeter	13	0	You bureaucrats have no right to play God and take that tube out!	[]
Gabriel	13	0	Nono, see, they were playing God when they put the feeding tube IN!	[]
Anchor	12	0	A woman was arrested for trying to bring food to the patient.	[]
Mrs. Garrison	7	0	Get your man-hands off of me!	[]
Anchor	15	0	However, a growing number of people are also standing behind Kenny's BFF, Eric Cartman.	[]
Man 1	17	0	We must respect the wishes of people's BFFs. Otherwise, all our BFF necklaces would become meaningless	[]
Man 2	15	0	We all have BFFs, and we believe that a BFF is the highest legal authority.	[]
Cartman	6	0	That's right. Respect our authoritah.	[]
Satan	4	0	What mockery is this?!	[]
Hooded Figure	2	0	My Lord...	[]
Satan	22	0	The feeding tube has been pulled! If the child dies and his soul returns to Heaven, God will have his Keanu Reeves!	[]
Hooded Figure	8	0	Perhaps the child won't die in time.	[]
Satan	8	0	Forget it! I'm calling the attack off!	[]
Hooded Figure	16	0	No! Keep your army marching, my Lord. I will get that feeding tube put back in.	[]
Satan	1	0	How?	[]
Hooded Figure	10	0	I will do what we always do: Use the Republicans.	[]
George Bush	11	0	We Republicans are deeply saddened by the tragic events in Colorado.	[]
Hooded Figure	7	0	Removing the feeding tube is murder, hughughughughughugh...	[]
George Bush	6	0	Removing the feeding tube is murder!	[]
Hooded Figure	11	0	Who are we to decide if Kenny should live or die?	[]
George Bush	11	0	Who are we to decide if Kenny should live or die?	[]
Hooded Figure	8	0	It is God's will that he live!	[]
George Bush	9	0	It is God's will that he LIVE!  Haaghaghaghaghaghagha...	[]
Hooded Figure	8	0	No no, you don't say that part.	[]
George Bush	9	0	No no, you don't say that part, haghaghaghagha.	[]
Angel 9	5	0	Jesus, their army is massive.	[]
Angel 10	3	0	Heaven help us.	[]
Anchor	28	0	The biggest battle of all time is about to begin: the battle of the feeding tube! As people on both sides of the argument vie for media attention.	[]
Kyle	14	0	We want all the country to see that Kenny is alive, and in pain!	[]
Cartman	17	0	I believe the people at home see he's NOT in pain because he's a tomato!	[]
Kyle	7	0	You say tomato, but I say Kenny!	[]
Cartman	7	0	You say Kenny, but I say tomato!	[]
Cartman's Side	1	0	Tomato!	[]
Kyle's Side	2	0	Kenny! Kenny!	[]
Cartman's Side	1	0	Tomato!	[]
Judge	14	0	Uuhh, excuse me. I uh, just found the last page of Kenny's will.	[]
Cartman	1	0	What?	[]
Judge	14	0	I found the page where Kenny specified his wishes about being on life support.	[]
Stan	5	0	Well, what does it say?	[]
Judge	32	0	If I should ever be in a vegetative state and kept alive on life support, please...  for the love of God, don't ever show me in that condition on national television.	[]
Stan	1	0	Oooo.	[]
Man	1	0	Oowhoops	[]
Kyle	28	0	Oh geez. Maybe we let this thing get out of hand. This issue is so complicated, but... m-maybe we sh-should just let Kenny go in peace.	[]
Stan	7	0	You mean, Cartman's side is right?	[]
Kyle	17	0	Cartman's side is right, for the wrong reasons. But we're wrong, for the right reasons.	[]
Both sides	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Kyle	11	0	Come on, everybody. I think Kenny wants to be left alone.	[]
Anchor	30	0	We've just received word that Kenny McCormick... has passed away. The debate still rages on in America, but at least now, Kenny... is in a much more peaceful place.	[]
Angel 11	10	0	The armies of Satan have already broken through the gate!	[]
Angel 12	4	0	We're gonna die!!!	[]
Michael	13	0	Send our troops to the battlefield! I'll command as best I can!	[]
Gabriel	9	0	Michael! Michael!  The humans finally did the right thing!	[]
Michael	115	1	Oh my God, they killed Kenny! Get him into the command station! Hurry!  Satan's army charges! Tell our troops what to do, Kenny!  So it begins.  Now we shall see the final battle between Heaven and Hell play out!  Yesss, good, Kenny! The angel spearmen are taking out their demon soul rippers! Oh, the cavalry angels are clashing with their Black Knights! Oh my God! My God, this battle is epic! Ohh, they're bringing in their demon dragons! Look at the size of them! My God, this is even bigger than the final battle in the Lord of the Rings movie! It's like, it's like TEN times bigger than that battle!	['hell']
Satan	6	0	No! NO! How are we losing?!	[]
Spy Angel	12	0	The child's soul is in Heaven! God has his secret weapon!	[]
Satan	2	0	Full retreat!	[]
Hooded Figure	3	0	Patience, my Lord!	[]
Satan	11	0	No, Kevin!  That's it! I'm breaking up with you!	[]
Michael	33	0	Yesss. Yes, Kenny! Satan's forces are retreating! This is TRULY a sight to behold! OH I wish I had a camcorder!  We have done it! We have defeated the armies of Satan!	[]
Peter	10	0	Kenny! Bless your soul! You've saved all of Heaven!	[]
Michael	39	0	Yes, Kenny! And to thank you for all you've done, we are going to give you a very special gift. For saving the entire universe from the forces of evil, we give you this.  Keanu Reeves' statue.  Congratulations.	[]
