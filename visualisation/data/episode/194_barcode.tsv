Intruder	9	0	You're Gordon Stoltski, right?! Truck driver from Chicago?!	[]
Gordon	12	0	No, I'm Gordon Stoltski, third grader who reads the morning announcements!	[]
Intruder	15	0	Yeah, right! We'll see if that's true. Go on, read the morning announcements!	[]
Gordon	3	0	SOMEBODY HELP ME!	[]

Gordon	10	0	No please! I'm so scared!   I'm so scared!	[]
Intruder	2	0	DO IT!	[]
Gordon	22	0	Please! I'll duh, I'll do whatever you say! Here! Here I see! Here!  I got my mouth on the ba-	[]
Intruder	8	0	Look at you now. We're all dead.	[]
Mr. Mackey	141	0	We will always remember the way that Gordon bravely read the announcements every morning, led us in the Pledge of Allegiance, m'kay, and touched many kids' lives here at the school. And even now that we know the shooter had him confused with a forty-year-old truck driver who happened to have a similar name, I know this has been ...pretty traumatizing, m'kay. But now we must decide who will pick up up where little Gordon left off. Who will take his place reading the morning announcements? It's a big responsibility, because it will be your voice the entire school listens to, m'kay? And although Gordon Stoltski can never be replaced, m'kay, there must be a student out there who has the drive and the passion to... have his or her voice heard every morning.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Oh. My. Goodddd.	[]
Cartman	14	0	Soo, you're uuh, trying out to be the morning announcement person as well?	[]
Boy	21	0	Yeah, I think it would be really fu-fu-fu-fun, and ru-ru-ru-rurrraise my self es-es-esesesteem.	[]
Mr. Mackey	20	0	Oh, this is it, huh? Okay, uhhh Mike, why don't we have you try out first, ituh m'kay.	[]
Cartman	16	1	He stuttered like a bitch! I've got this job in the bag!  Who are you?	['bitch']
Casey	71	0	My name is Casey Miller, and I'm in the third grade.  Ever since I can remember people have told me I should read their morning announcements. My friends always said to me, Dear Casey, your voice is like butter to our ears. Could you please find a way to get that audible chocolate on the airwaves? Well, here I am, and hopefully I'll be the kid with the job.	[]
Mr. Mackey	25	0	M'kay, really nice, Mike, uh, maybe next time you can get past the first word. Oh, Casey Miller, good, you're trying out too?	[]
Casey	16	0	I'm tryin' out and dryin' out in the sultry summer sun that is my voice.	[]
Mr. Mackey	7	0	M'kay. Eric, you wanna go next?	[]
Mr. Mackey	14	0	M'kay Eric, I'm just gonna have you read this piece of paper.	[]
Cartman	7	1	Mr. Mackey, what is a moronic jizzrag?	['jizzrag']
Mr. Mackey	10	0	What? What on earth are you askin' me that for?!	[]
Cartman	15	0	Well it's just that... that's what that Casey kid said about your hairpiece?	[]
Mr. Mackey	5	0	Get lost, you little dirtball!	[]
Casey	2	0	Excuse me?	[]
Mr. Mackey	5	0	I said take a hike!	[]
Casey	8	0	I don't understand... what I did wrong.	[]
Mr. Mackey	8	0	Beat it, you're not gettin' the job!	[]
Cartman	269	0	Good morning South Park Elementary. These are the morning announcements. And I, am Eric Cartman. All forms for the school book drive must be handed it to Mr. Davis in the library by the end of the school day today. Hm, doesn't seem like they gave us a lot of notice on that, uh, 'kay. Oh well.  For lunch today, the cafeteria will be serving a selection of cold sandwiches. Cold sandwiches. Oh well, thank you so much! Remember when we used to be served hot food? I mean, what has happened to our school? This school is transforming into something very bad, and why? Because we have leadership that doesn't care! I'm talking of course about our student body president, Wendy Testaburger!  Ever since Wendy was elected student body president, this school has started a rapid decline towards some socialist regime where students no longer have a voice! The music room will be closed off today due to painting. All students in band and choir will meet in the gymnasium instead. Oh oh, so now, so now the school is using money to paint the music room. How old and outdated is our playground equipment? What other school has a fifteen-year-old merry-go-round on it? Our school president is turning this whole place into Communist Russia!  It's not a coincidence that once Wendy took office this school started coming apart at the seams! Your teachers don't wanna tell you, but they are scared, and they should be, because the very fabric of this elementary school is tearing from all corners.	[]
Butters	2	0	Oh jeez!	[]
Cartman	68	3	But hey, I'm just a normal kid, like you, except that I ask questions. And because I'm brave enough to ask questions, I come under scrutinies. Is Wendy using your lunch money to buy heroin? Probably not, but how can we know? I don't want my lunch money going to drugs! Who's taking these drugs? What would be the point? I'm asking questions!	['heroin', 'drugs', 'drugs']
Kyle	5	0	Will somebody shut him up?	[]
Cartman	7	0	You wanted to see me, Principal Victoria?	[]
Principal Victoria	19	0	The job is to read what is written on the paper, Eric, not to embellish the way you do.	[]
Cartman	26	0	Oohhhh I get it. You're trying to silence me! You're scared that somebody is standing up to this school and its president for once!	[]
Principal Victoria	20	0	No, it's just that the announcements need to be quick so the students can get on with their work.	[]
Cartman	18	0	Oh really?! Then how come Gordon Stoltski got to go on for like five minutes that one day?!	[]
Mr. Mackey	6	0	Well, because he was being murdered.	[]
Cartman	48	0	You just want somebody to read what's in front of them like a brain-washed zombie, is that it Mr. Mackey? I am not Gordon Stoltski, okay?! I'm not some dog on a leash that just blindly says what he's told, until he's killed!	[]
Principal Victoria	8	0	All we ask is you keep it shorter.	[]
Cartman	38	0	Oh I will! And maybe I'll also have a word with the ACLU, tell them that a student is being told not to speak out against his school! I'm sure they'll find that very interesting!	[]
Cartman	162	0	Well. Goood morning South Park Elementary. These are the morning announcements. Tryouts for the soccer team are on Friday afternoon. That is of course if our student body president does something about our abysmal soccer field.  I have a question. What does Wendy Testaburger actually do? She is supposed to be the president, right? What is her agenda? She's lying to everyone? Or is she? Let's ask these questions.  Today I wanna talk briefly about the state of our school's economy. The bake sale last week was a complete failure. And in the school-  And besides that, who actually voted for Wendy Testaburger? I know I didn't. And everyone who did is now scratching their heads and goin' Whoops. Guess I shouldn't have done that.  I'm not in the student council, I'm just a normal kid like all of you. And like all of you, I want to know what has happened... to my school.	[]
Third Graders	6	0	I pledge allegiance to the flag -	[]
Cartman	19	0	- of the United States of America. OUR United States, not the one Wendy Testaburger would have, a socialist dunghole -	[]
Kindergartners	3	0	- a socialist dunghole...	[]
Cartman	37	0	Good morning students. These are the morning announcements. If you'll direct your attention to the new video monitors at the head of your class,  you will see that the announcements are now being done in video.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Oh God, no!	[]
Cartman	160	0	Lunch today is going to be pizza. Again.  Friends, our school is dying and you know it. You feel it. You're like, you're like me; you wanna change it. But ohhh no, Wendy Testaburger's not gonna let that happen! This is not the school we grew up in, and ...and I don't know if we can get it back.  So let's take a look at exactly what our school president wants. You know, what is she trying to achieve? Let's just take a look at these Keywords here: Wendy's made it clear she wants our school to be a more Integrated Leftist and Liberal place! But you see what then happens, what we get is a Socialist, Modern, Utopian, Reformed, Farce of a School. So when you look closely it becomes very obvious what Wendy wants. K I L L S M U R F S. Our school president ...wants to kill Smurfs.	[]
Ike	1	0	NOOO!	[]
Cartman	30	0	I don't know if we're turning into a Smurf-hating school or what we're turning into, but unless you ask why , we're gonna transform into something.	[]
Butters	6	0	Hey Wendy! Wendy! Is it true?	[]
Wendy	3	0	Is what true?	[]
Butters	4	0	That you hate Smurfs?	[]
Wendy	7	0	I don't have time for this.	[]
Butters	10	0	Hey now! Me and us fellers were just asking questions!	[]
Melvins	7	0	Yeah, that's right. We can ask.	[]
Wendy	22	1	Try to understand this: all I do is try to help run student council. I don't give a crap about Smurfs!	['crap']
Butters	3	0	It is true!	[]
Melvin 1	3	0	Oh my God!	[]
Melvin 2	2	0	Yeah, bemememe	[]
Melvin 3	3	0	Oh my God!	[]
Wendy	25	0	Maybe you guys should check into what student council actually does, before you just blindly listen to what some idiot with a microphone tells you!	[]
Butters	17	2	What did the Smurfs ever do to you! Ya bitch! I just called the president a bitch.	['bitch', 'bitch']
Casey	1	0	Hyeah.	[]
Melvin 1	3	0	That was cool.	[]
Melvin 4	1	0	Awesome	[]
Melvin 2	4	0	Yeah, that was cool.	[]
Melvin 3	3	0	Yeah, great job.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Thank you and this is to..?	[]
Douglas	1	0	Douglas.	[]
Cartman	16	0	To Douglas. There you go.  Book signing today everyone, be sure to pick up your copy.	[]
Butters	2	0	Hey Eric!	[]
Cartman	12	0	Well hello. Another person who  cares about the future of our school?	[]
Butters	24	0	Oh you bet! I love all the stuff you said about how our school president never does anything, and how she's changing everything?	[]
Cartman	20	0	Yes, well now you can read about all those things I've said, Butters. Take this copy of my book.	[]
Butters	2	0	Cool, thanks.	[]
Cartman	5	0	That'll be five dollars.	[]
Butters	2	0	Oh, okay.	[]
Stan	9	1	What the hell do you think you're doing?!	['hell']
Cartman	3	0	A book signing.	[]
Stan	22	1	I looked through your stupid book! It's five hundred and forty pages of ripping on Wendy and calling her a slut!	['slut']
Cartman	9	1	I do not directly say she's a slut!	['slut']
Stan	52	1	Wendy Testaburger has proven time and time again that she will do anything to pleasure her vagina. Whether it is the school football team or the janitors on their break, Wendy spends her time as president on her knees or on her back taking the old in-out for hours on end!	['vagina']
Cartman	7	0	You didn't read the rest, dude.	[]
Stan	3	0	Or does she?	[]
Cartman	32	0	Or does she? See, that's a question. I'm asking questions, Stan! I've called for Wendy to come on my show and defend herself, but she won't do it!	[]
Butters	5	0	Yeah, and she hates Smurfs!	[]
Boy 1	25	1	Shouldn't we be worried if our school president is a girl who would rather get her tits licked than go to student council meetings?	['tits']
Stan	5	0	Hey hey, stop reading that!	[]
Boy 1	5	0	Wull what do you mean?	[]
Stan	30	0	Listen, just because a guy's voice is on the intercom and his words are in a book, doesn't mean he has any idea what he's talking about!	[]
Boy 2	3	0	Yes it does!	[]
Casey	37	2	Eric Cartman is simply making it so that all kids take responsibility to question their school leaders. We should all ask if our president is a penis-hungry hooker with a huge vagina. I'm Casey Miller.	['penis', 'vagina']
Stan	12	0	Wendy, did you see the stuff Cartman is saying about you now?	[]
Wendy	6	0	I really don't care, Stan.	[]
Stan	24	1	Well don't you think you should go on his show and defend yourself?! Everyone is starting to think you're a crappy president.	['crappy']
Wendy	34	1	I'm not giving Eric Fartman one minute of my time, you got that?! I'm not acknowledging his stupid questions. If you want him dealt with, you'll have to do it yourself!	['fartman']
Cartman	8	0	You wanted to see me again, Principal Victoria?	[]
Principal Victoria	24	0	Eric, we've been informed by a concerned student that you are writing naughty books about one of the girls here at the school.	[]
Cartman	19	0	Oh, Wendy came and told on me?! So what? Because she's president she can't be written about?	[]
Mr. Mackey	19	0	Eric, apparently you wrote that Wendy's private parts are big enough to fly an airplane through, m'kay?	[]
Cartman	17	0	And what if they are?! You'll stop me from asking just because Wendy forces you to?!	[]
Mr. Mackey	15	0	Eric, the student body president really doesn't have the kind of power that you-	[]
Cartman	20	0	Just enough power to force you to stop me from selling my book! Face it, you're a lackey, Mackey!	[]
Principal Victoria	22	0	Eric, I've had enough! You cannot and you will not sell your books on school grounds! Do I make myself clear?!	[]
Cartman	57	1	Clear as summer rain! Clear as a flavorless bottle of vitamin water! This school has finally transformed to the socialist whoreland where a student isn't free! Well I'm not gonna be a part of it, do you understand?! I'm leaving this... hypocritical Communist school! i'm walking out and I'm never coming back!	['whoreland']
Announcer	15	0	Live, from the principal's office, these are the morning announcements. Here, is Eric Cartman.	[]
Cartman	117	0	Yesterday, as most of you know, I walked out on this program, and on our school. I was so... fed up with our president's hypocrisies, me not being able to sell my book. I wanted to live in a place where my values were still upheld. And so I decided to leave it all behind and instead just go and live with the Smurfs.  I simply observed the gentle Smurfs at first. I wanted to understand how they could live such simple and decent lives. They were wary of me in the beginning, but slowly I began to earn their trust.  It wasn't long before the gentle Smurfs accepted me as one of their own.	[]
Butters	1	0	Whoa...	[]
Cartman	57	0	The smurfs and I grew to understand each other.  They shared with me their art of picking Smurfberries, and I shared with them stories of my country's forefathers. Of course, it wasn't long before ...I fell in love with Smurfette.  We're from two different worlds and yet we spoke the common language of passion.	[]
Kyle	5	0	These, are the morning announcements.	[]
Cartman	69	0	Papa Smurf was displeased at first,  He told Smurfette I wasn't a real Smurf and we could never be happy. But I eventually proved myself to Papa Smurf by picking more Smurfberries than any Smurf had ever Smurfed before. Finally, all was right with the world. But then, a crisis. Clumsy Smurf burst into the Smurf ceremony to say that humans had come to destroy all of Smurfland.	[]
Cartman Smurf	19	0	No! No, you must leave the noble Smurfs alone! Who's behind all this?!  I should have known. Wendy!	[]
Human Wendy	4	0	Out of my way!	[]
Cartman Smurf	6	0	Wendy, what are you doing here?!	[]
Human Wendy	20	0	Smurfberries are worth a lot of money. With all those Smurfberries I can power the school for the entire year.	[]
Cartman Smurf	19	0	Wendy, I know you're president of our school, but you can't just dig up the Smurfs' land!	[]
Human Wendy	9	3	Fuck the Smurfs! They can suck my fat tits!	['fuck', 'fat', 'tits']
Cartman Smurf	6	0	How many Smurfberries is enough, Wendy?!	[]
Human Wendy	7	2	You can suck my fat tits too!	['fat', 'tits']
Cartman Smurf	2	0	Smurfette noooo!	[]
Human Wendy	4	2	Suck mah fat tits!	['fat', 'tits']
Cartman	93	0	And so now our school has plenty of precious unattainable Smurfberries. Yeah well big deal. At what cost did our school president get it? Every Smurf is dead. Wiped out and we will never see them again! Go on, look outside! You won't see any Smurfs!  Of course, since I'm being silenced, I'm not allowed time to show you the entire movie. And so please buy Dances with Smurfs available now on DVD.  The question now is, What happened to morals? What happened to dignity? What happened to my schooool?	[]
Butters	14	0	That does it! Our student council is corrupt and has to be dealt with!	[]
A Melvin	7	0	I can no longer stand idly by.	[]
Butters	34	0	We need to get all the kids together who wanna fight back and tell them to meet after school! We will forever remember this day, the day we finally stood up to Wendy Testaburger!	[]
Casey	16	2	It is time for that slutty Smurf-killing bitch to get what's comin' to 'er.	['slutty', 'bitch']
Melvins	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Butters	55	0	I don't know about all of you, but I have had enough! We've been sitting back and watching as our school slowly goes into the toilet! But today, we do something about it!  So let's march right over there to Wendy's house and do what we know needs to be done!	[]
Butters	8	0	Let us not forget what happens this day!	[]
A Melvin	2	0	Woo on!	[]
Butters	5	0	We are here, Wendy Testaburger!	[]
Melvin 2	4	0	Take that, school president!	[]
Melvin 3	3	0	Get her good!	[]
Butters	2	0	I am.	[]
Wendy	5	0	Hey, what are you doing?	[]
Butters	16	0	The students want answerrrrs! Go on the Morning Announcements if you've got nothing to hide!	[]
Mr. Testaburger	3	1	What the hell?	['hell']
Butters	10	0	Wah!  Smurfkiller!  Answer for your crimes on the Morning Announcements!	[]
Mr. Testaburger	14	0	Wendy, did a boy just pee on our door because the Smurfs were murdered?	[]
Wendy	10	0	It's okay Dad, I'll take care of it.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Thank you so much for finally coming on my show, Wendy.	[]
Wendy	7	0	Yeah, well, Butters peed on my house.	[]
Cartman	13	0	People are riled up. Hopefully we can clear the air here this morning.	[]
Wendy	11	0	If we could just keep it to questions about Student Council?	[]
Cartman	8	0	Of course. That's why we're here.	[]
A Boy	2	0	Five seconds.	[]
Cartman	64	0	Don't worry, I won't go too hard on you.  Good morning South Park Elementary, these are the morning announcements. Rehearsals for the school play are cancelled this afternoon. For lunch the cafeteria will be serving meat loaf or veggie pasta. My guest today is the student body president of South Park Elementary, Wendy Testaburger. Wendy, thank you for coming on the show.	[]
Wendy	1	0	Sure.	[]
Cartman	20	0	Wendy, I wanna start by asking a pretty straightforward question, and I hope you don't take offense to it.	[]
Wendy	1	0	Okay.	[]
Cartman	10	0	How many Smurfberries is the life of each Smurf worth?	[]
Wendy	9	0	I don't, I, I have no idea what-	[]
Cartman	14	0	You don't know how many Smurfberries the life of each Smurf is worth.	[]
Butters	6	0	Ohhh, he's got her now!	[]
Cartman	12	0	Would you agree that the school is in a crisis right now?	[]
Wendy	12	0	I believe there is a ...few things wrong with the school, but-	[]
Cartman	16	0	If a Smurf dies and no one is around to hear it, does it still scream?	[]
Butters	3	0	She's speechless!	[]
Cartman	34	1	You are the president of the school. Can you see why many students think you're an ineffective slut? Are you denying that the Smurf holocaust ever happened? Is that what you're suggesting?	['slut']
Wendy	15	0	Look, Eric, you have to understand. The Smurfberries were our school government's only option.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Yes, and that makes- whoa whoa what?	[]
Wendy	60	0	What was I supposed to do? The school was running out of power. We tried relocating the Smurfs at first, but they wouldn't budge! So we decided to get somebody on the inside. A member of the school who could act like one of the Smurfs and learn their secrets. But of course you know that, don't you?	[]
Cartman	8	0	What? What do you mean I know that?	[]
Wendy	27	0	I'm just asking a question. We all knew you were sent in to live with the Smurfs, but did you know they would be wiped out?	[]
Cartman	6	0	No! You wiped them all out!	[]
Wendy	51	0	Nobody expected you to fall in love with Smurfette. You went to learn from them, but instead you became one of them, right? Fought against your own kind when you knew we'd stop at nothing! Do you know that one Smurfberry can power the school for two months? One Smurfberry!	[]
Cartman	8	0	Wait, hold on, can we take a break?	[]
Wendy	46	0	No, it's okay! It's all out in the open now. I wouldn't have had to kill the Smurfs if they would have simply moved on. But you gave them the will to stay, and I guess... you can't be blamed for that.	[]
Stan	1	0	What?!	[]
Wendy	24	0	And that is why... I'm stepping down. You were right all along, Cartman. And I am hereby making you the student body president.	[]
Butters	8	0	All right! Cartman's president. We did it.	[]
A Melvin	3	0	I'm confused.	[]
Cartman	17	0	Dude, you can't take my Dances with Smurfs idea and turn it into your own thing-	[]
Wendy	29	0	No, you're right. The students all deserve to know the truth. And so I have answered what really happened in my new book, Going Rogue on the Smurfs.	[]
Cartman	23	0	No! No, dude! You don't just take one person's story and then add a couple of things and call it yours!	[]
Wendy	17	0	Luckily with the money I made selling the movie rights to my book, I'll be okay.	[]
Cartman	7	0	You sold the movie rights to who?!	[]
Wendy	9	0	James Cameron. Go look. The movie came out already.	[]
Cartman	11	0	Theh- They can't do that! I'm student body president!	[]
Cartman	36	4	Oh God damn it! Son of a bitch idea-stealing assholes!  You sons of bitches! Dances with Smurfs was MY idea! MY IDEA!  You can't just take Dances with Smurfs and call it something else!	['damn', 'bitch', 'assholes', 'bitches']
Cartman	1	0	Huh!	[]
Stan	11	0	Dude, what happened? You're not doing the morning announcements anymore?	[]
Cartman	20	0	No, because it turns out that by rule, the student body president can't also be the morning announcement reader!	[]
Kyle	15	0	Oh well, at least as president you can run the school the way you want.	[]
Cartman	32	1	I can't do jack! I went to my first student council meeting; all we did was talk about what colors to make the stupid Sadie Hawkins dance! Student council's retarded!	['retarded']
Casey	89	6	The sun is up and the birds are chirping. I'm Casey Miller and these, are the morning announcements. I have a letter from second-grade student Brian Falner. Brian writes, Dear Casey, why is our school president such a fat stupid dickhead? My desk is broken, and so far Eric Cartman has done nothing about it. Will you please let that walking bowl of anus pus know that we are not happy? Well Brian, I couldn't agree more. Our asshole president is a fat smelly douchebag milkshake.	['fat', 'dickhead', 'anus', 'asshole', 'fat', 'douchebag']
Cartman	7	0	I'm doin' the best I can!	[]
