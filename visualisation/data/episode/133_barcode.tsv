Stan	12	0	Dude, you are right, Cartman. Your uncle Roy has a sweet boat.	[]
Cartman	16	0	Yeah. Isn't this fun? Just you and me hangin' out, Stan. No stupid Kyle around.	[]
Stan	9	0	Man, I wish I could really drive this thing.	[]
Cartman	3	0	You know how?	[]
Stan	3	0	Sure I do!	[]
Cartman	10	0	Well here.  Roy keeps the keys in the glove box.	[]
Stan	12	0	Dude, I don't think your uncle'd want us driving it.	[]
Cartman	22	0	Nobody's gonna know. We just drive it around the marina real quick. Look, if anything happens, I'll take full responsibility.	[]
Stan	5	0	Okay, turn on the ignition,	[]
Cartman	1	0	Awesome.	[]
Stan	1	0	Okay...	[]
Cartman	4	0	We're not moving.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Maybe you have the parking brake on.	[]
Stan	16	1	Boats don't have parking brakes, dumbass! They only have the... oh wait wait. Neutral button!	['dumbass']
Cartman	2	0	Waaait! Waitwaitwaaait!	[]
Stan	2	0	Jesus Christ!!!	[]
Cartman	8	0	Stan... beaver dam!  Very large beaver dam, Stan!!	[]
Stan	4	0	Oh dude! Oh Jesus!	[]
Cartman	7	0	Dude! Stan! You are in serious trouble!	[]
Stan	10	0	You said you'd take responsibility to your uncle Roy!	[]
Cartman	18	0	I don't even have an uncle Roy! That was just some guy's boat I knew about.	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Cartman	32	0	Look, it's okay. We weren't here. This didn't happen, okay. We were both at my house all afternoon long playing Tea Party. Okay? Now come on, we gotta bail!	[]
Stan	10	0	Oh God, I hope I didn't hurt any beavers.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Dude, come on! We've gotta get out of here!	[]
Announcer	20	0	With an eye on America and all of today's events, it's South Park Evening News, with Tom Pusslicker	[]
Tom	51	0	Herro, crisis and fear tonight, as what appears to be a massive flood has overtaken the town of Beaverton, Colorado, home of the world's largest beaver dam.  Earlier today, a break in the beaver dam which protected the town broke open, trapping people in their houses and destroying their lives.	[]
Sharon	6	0	Oh my gosh, those poor people.	[]
Field Reporter	55	0	Tom, I'm currently ten miles outside of Beaverton, unable to get inside the town proper. We do not have any reports of fatalities yet, but we believe that the death toll may be in the hundreds of millions. Beaverton has only a population of about eight thousand, Tom, so this would be quite devastating.	[]
Tom	12	0	Any word on how the survivors in the town are doing, Mitch?	[]
Mitch	32	0	W-we're not sure what exactly is going on inside the town of Beaverton, uh Tom, but we're reporting that there's looting, raping, and yes, even acts of cannibalism.	[]
Tom	15	0	My God, you've, you've actually seen people looting, raping and eating each other?	[]
Mitch	14	0	No, no, we haven't actually seen it Tom, we're just reporting it.	[]
Sharon	7	0	You all done with your fishsticks, Stan?	[]
Randy	10	0	I'll help you, Sharon.  Boy, that's just awful.	[]
Tom	16	0	In the nearby town of South Park, the cause of the Beaverton flood is being investigated.	[]
Man 1	9	0	That's right! We know whose fault this is!	[]
Stan	2	0	Huh oh.	[]
Man 1	6	0	It's George Bush's fault!	[]
Man 2	8	0	Yeah! George Bush doesn't care about beavers!	[]
Man 3	14	0	George Bush didn't break that beaver dam! It was terrorists and Al Qaeda!	[]
Man 4	11	0	They've been secretly building beaver dam WMDs for years now!	[]
Stan	11	0	Mom, Dad?  Theh, they're gonna go help those people, right?	[]
Sharon	24	0	I don't know. You know, to me, it seems like the mayor of Beaverton should've done something about that dam years ago.	[]
Randy	17	0	Don't blame the mayor, Sharon. What about FEMA? Think this whole thing is really their fault.	[]
Stan	15	0	Ye-but, uh, s-somebody's gonna help the people off their, their rooftops, right?	[]
Randy	17	0	That's not important right now, son. What's important is figuring out whose fault this is.	[]
Stan	9	0	Dude! Dude, did you see the news last night?	[]
Cartman	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Stan	9	0	You saw all those people trapped on their roofs?	[]
Cartman	5	0	Shyeah, that was pretty funny.	[]
Stan	10	0	Pretty funny?! Dude, we did that!! That was our fault!	[]
Cartman	22	0	Hehey, no no! We aren't the ones who built a town beneath a giant beaver dam, okay?! That's their fault!	[]
Stan	10	0	But they're trapped now and nobody's helping them!	[]
Cartman	8	0	Well they should've gotten out of there!	[]
Stan	6	0	Maybe they couldn't get out!	[]
Cartman	2	0	We did!	[]
Stan	13	0	Dude, ah I just...  ah I don't know what to do here.	[]
Cartman	60	4	Ah ah ah, ah, I know what you're thinking, Stan. You're thinking, you're gonna go tell Kyle. Look, I know you think he's your best friend, but Kyle is a Jew rat! He has his Jew ethics while he hoards his greedy Jew gold, and he will Jew you out if you tell him about this!	['jew', 'jew', 'jew', 'jew']
Kyle	14	0	Hey dudes.  Sorry I couldn't make it yesterday. What'd you guys do?	[]
Stan	1	0	Nothing	[]
Cartman	2	0	Hngh, totally.	[]
Butters	12	0	Hey, everybody, they just found out what caused the flood in Beaverton!	[]
Cartman	2	1	Aw crap!	['crap']
Mr. Mackey	7	0	Quiet, children, quiet! We need to hear.	[]
Tom	69	0	At first, nobody knew what caused the dam to break, but now, shocking new evidence has indicated that the flood in Beaverton was caused by... global warming!  It now appears that... all rumors of global warming were true. We were warned this would happen and ...we didn't listen!  We didn't listen!  All the top Colorado geologists have gathered at the governor's office for an emergency meeting.	[]
Randy	44	0	Ladies and Gentlemen, if Global Warming has in fact already caused the Beaverton flood, then this is only the beginning. The effects are going to spread. What we are looking at is a global warming catastrophe the likes of which we've never seen.	[]
Geologist 1	11	0	Excuse me, sir, but, ...when? When is this going to happen?	[]
Randy	20	0	My colleagues in the scientific community are still running tests, but... we believe it may happen... the day after tomorrow.	[]
Geologist 2	40	0	Excuse me, I'm sure we're all very impressed with your wild theories, Doctor uh, Marsh, but the fact is no statistical proof has ever been confirmed that global warming exists. Are you suggesting we shut down the economy?!	[]
Randy	18	0	With all due respect, cliche dissenting Republican, the economy isn't going to matter... the day after tomorrow.	[]
Scientist 1	8	0	Listen! Listen! We've finished running the tests!	[]
Scientist 2	13	0	Global Warming is going to strike... two days before the day after tomorrow.	[]
Randy	6	0	Oh my God... That's today!	[]
Man 5	4	0	We didn't listen!	[]
Randy	9	0	Stan! Get in the car! We have to evacuate!	[]
Man 6	4	0	We didn't listen!	[]
Randy	4	0	Come onnn, come on!	[]
Sharon	8	0	It's useless. This traffic isn't moving!	[]
Stan	28	0	Dad, isn't it possible the flood wasn't caused by global warming? I, I mean, the water was held back by a giant beaver dam, after all.	[]
Randy	27	0	No, Stan, I'm afraid us adults just let you children down. We didn't take care of our earth, and now you've inherited our problems.	[]
Driver	4	0	We didn't listen!	[]
Randy	16	0	We, we didn't listen!  Come on! Everyone grab what you can! We have to walk!	[]
Man 7	5	0	Oh Jesus, here it comes!	[]
Man 8	2	0	Global warming!	[]
Man 9	7	0	It's coming! Here comes global warming!	[]
Man 10	4	0	We didn't listen!	[]
Randy	3	0	Come on, hurry!	[]
Man 11	11	0	It's right behind us!  It's coming the other way!	[]
Randy	4	0	Go back, go back!!	[]
Stephen	7	0	Everyone into the community center! Hurry! Go!	[]
Randy	8	0	Get inside! We have to close these doors!	[]
Randy	26	0	Come on, we've got to board up that last window! Seal off all the doorways! We must try to protect ourselves from the global warming.	[]
Sheila	6	0	Mr. Garrison, are you all right?	[]
Mrs. Garrison	16	1	I'm in pretty bad shape. My... leg is broken and my... left boob is leaking	['boob']
Sharon	4	0	Here you go, sweetheart.	[]
Stan	13	0	Mom, you know, those people in Beaverton are still trapped in the flood.	[]
Sharon	21	0	I know, but, I'm afraid it's too late for them, sweetie. We have to try and save ourselves now.	[]
Gerald	8	0	Shh, shh! We've got the television working!	[]
Announcer	9	0	This is a FOX News update! Global Warming Disaster!	[]
Anchor	22	0	Global warming appears to have struck as predicted in the Colorado Rockies! All around the country, panic and chaos are settling in!	[]
Field Reporter	35	0	Tom, I am standing just outside of Chicago, where the panic of global warming has already caused countless deaths. Already we're reporting that the death toll here in Chicago is over 600 billion people	[]
Officer Barbrady	2	0	Oh God.	[]
Stephen	6	0	This is all your fault, Jimbo!	[]
Jimbo	1	0	Me??	[]
Stephen	16	1	Yeah! You drive that damn SUV around! You didn't even think about global warming, DIDJA?!	['damn']
Kyle	20	0	Can you believe it, Stan? I never thought global warming could happen so fast. I guess... I didn't listen.	[]
Stan	7	0	Kyle, it... it isn't global warming.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Huh?	[]
Stan	17	0	Global warming isn't happening right now. It's, it's not what caused the Beaverton flood.	[]
Kyle	5	0	How do you know that?	[]
Stan	8	0	Because, I know what did cause the flood.	[]
Kyle	2	0	George Bush?	[]
Stan	1	0	No.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Terrorists?	[]
Stan	1	0	No.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Communists?	[]
Stan	1	0	No.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Chinese radicals?	[]
Stan	1	0	No.	[]
Kyle	1	0	...Cartman?	[]
Stan	2	0	...sort of.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Cartman flooded Beaverton?!!	[]
Stan	28	0	Shh! Not, not exactly. We were messing around in this guy's new boat, and Cartman egged me on, and, and I crashed it into the Beaverton dam.	[]
Kyle	8	0	Dude, you have to tell everyone. Right now.	[]
Cartman	10	1	Hey Stan.  Oh Goddammit you told Kyle, didn't you?!	['goddammit']
Kyle	22	0	Stan, people in Beaverton are still trapped on their roofs. Nobody's helping them because they think they can't go outside.	[]
Cartman	31	1	Oh, here we go. See? I told you! If you're so caring, Kyle, why don't you share some of your Jew gold with the people caught in the flood?!	['jew']
Stan	11	0	Look, maybe, maybe we can help those people in Beaverton ourselves.	[]
Kyle	1	0	How?	[]
Cartman	1	0	Why?	[]
Stan	29	0	We can sneak out of here, get a boat, and go help them off their roofs. That way, I can do the right thing, but still lie about it.	[]
Randy	8	0	Listen, listen everyone! Nobody can leave this building!	[]
Mrs. Garrison	6	0	But... we need supplies, food, silicone.	[]
Randy	37	0	You go outside, and you'll die! By now, the global warming has... shifted the climate,  bringing on a new ice age. Within the hour, the temperature outside will fall to over 70 million degrees below zero!	[]
Stephen	1	0	Jesus.	[]
Randy	15	0	All we can do... is try to wait it out, as long as we can.	[]
Gerald	6	0	And... the rest of the country?	[]
Randy	57	1	Everyone below this line  will have to be evacuated to the south. Everyone above this line  is already dead. People like us in the middle states have to ride it out.  The balmy southwestern states  might have a chance but, New York  will have tidal waves that envelop all of the northeast.  What, Frank?!  Aw awww, Goddammit!	['goddammit']
Resident 1	12	0	Hello? Anybody? We'd like to be rescued, please. Any day now.	[]
Resident 2	7	0	Why haven't they come for us?	[]
Resident 1	5	0	I... I don't know.	[]
Resident 3	6	0	Wait, look! Here comes a boat!	[]
Resident 2	6	0	Really? Oh! It's about time!	[]
Wife	5	0	Oh Kevin, we're saved!	[]
Resident 3	6	0	It looks like... three little boys.	[]
Resident 1	20	0	Hey, we'll take it!  Over here, yes! Thank you! Thank you!  Oh, thanks. Thanks. That's a LOT better.	[]
Kyle	10	0	We can't get out! The flames are too big!	[]
Cartman	25	0	Oh great! You see, Stan?! This is what you get for listening to Kyle!  Oh, you've gotta help those people. It's your responsibility.	[]
Kyle	17	0	Stan, it's over. You have to admit what you did so our parents could help us!	[]
Randy	2	0	Stan?? Stan!!	[]
Gerald	9	0	Randy! We've looked everywhere! Kyle's missing too!	[]
Sharon	7	0	Oh my God! Where would they go?!	[]
Stephen	8	0	Randy, Randy! Your son's on the phone!	[]

Stan	9	0	No, Dad, listen: I need to tell you something.	[]
Randy	4	0	What is it, son?	[]
Stan	8	0	Nothing. Can you just come get us, please?	[]
Randy	19	0	You just stay put, son! I'm coming for you! Do you hear me?? I'm coming for you!!	[]

Gerald	6	0	You can't do this alone!	[]
Stephen	4	0	Let me go too.	[]
Man 12	11	0	You can't go out there. You'll freeze to death.	[]
Randy	20	0	All right, come on, both of you! We've gotta pull together every warm piece of clothing we can find.	[]
Gerald	7	0	Stephen!  Stephen, you have to keep moving!	[]
Stephen	8	0	I can't go on! Feel so... hot.	[]
Randy	11	0	Feeling warmth is a symptom of the last stages of hypothermia!	[]
Gerald	6	0	Oh Jesus...  I feel warm too!	[]
Randy	24	0	Yeah, me too.  Stephen, we've gotta keep moving! We're in deep hypothermia, all of us! We've gotta keep the blood flowing!	[]
Gerald	15	0	Maybe we should... strip these jackets off, and warm our bodies next to each other!	[]
Randy	15	1	Don't be a fag!  Come on! We can make it!  We have to try!	['fag']
General	21	0	Come on, people, we're running out of time! We need all Army helicopters to the Southern states for evacuation NOW!	[]
Officer	17	0	Sir! More people in Beaverton are calling. They say they're trapped in floods and fire now.	[]
General	28	0	Tell them that the government can't help them, but that we're very sorry. You know the plan, people! We can only evacuate citizens below this line!	[]
Scientist	4	0	E-excuse me, General?	[]
General	1	0	WHAT??	[]
Scientist	21	0	We've just compiled some new information. The er, the flood in Beaverton wasn't caused by global warming after all.	[]
General	1	0	What??	[]
Scientist	10	0	We know the truth now. We know what caused it!	[]
General	7	0	Oh my God. Quick! Radio the helicopters!	[]
Cartman	2	0	Help! Help!	[]
Kyle	8	0	Dude, this whole building is going to collapse!	[]
Stan	7	0	We have to find a way out!	[]
