Randy	11	0	This is important, Stanley!  You boys should care about this stuff.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Yeah, but we totally don't.	[]

Randy	8	0	Oh-oh boy, what's she done now?	[]
Anchorman	27	0	Britney Spears has been spotted camping in the Colorado mountains, and one report claims that she has taken a piss... in the forest. Robert Pooner has more.	[]
Robert Pooner	21	0	Ron, I'm standing in South Mark, Colorado, where Britney Spears has apparently been trying to get away from it all.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Aw dude, that's our town!	[]
Robert Pooner	41	0	Ms. Spears was spotted at a mountain campground , and you won't believe what she did, Ron. The troubled diva took a piss. Right on a ladybug. We've blurred out parts of the photo so that it doesn't offend.	[]
Randy	6	0	She's such a train wreck!	[]
Robert Pooner	15	0	When the photo is enhanced, Ron, you can see the poor little ladybug getting doused.	[]
Ron	22	0	This must be very embarrassing for Britney that this photo got out, Bob, and, and she looks like she's gained weight.	[]
Robert Pooner	25	0	That's right, Ron, she really chubbed up. And if you zoom in on her face, you can see that she's got some zits!	[]
Butters	3	0	Aw, poor girl.	[]
Randy	7	0	Hey Sharon, Britney peed on a ladybug.	[]
Ron	21	0	The photograph was taken by Brian Willis of Bailey, Colorado , who sold it to 31 News for a hundred thousand dollars.	[]
Kyle	4	0	A hundred thousand dollars?	[]
Cartman	6	0	That's enough to buy slaves!	[]
Ron	21	0	Britney is said to be now hiding out in a South Park motel. Aand now back to the stupid Democratic debates.	[]
Hillary Clinton	2	0	...and spearchuckers.	[]
Kyle	14	0	Did you guys hear that?! A hundred thousand dollars for a picture of Britney.	[]
Stan	9	0	And she's at a hotel in our town.	[]
Kyle	20	0	It's gotta be the Komfort Inn. It's the nicest hotel in South Park. Cartman, go get your camera.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Sweet!	[]
Butters	29	0	Hey, hanguh, hang on, fellas, don't you think Britney's been through enough? I mean, maybe it's finally time for us all to just leave her alone.	[]
Stan	7	1	Butters, don't be such a pussy.	['pussy']
Butters	1	0	Hokay.	[]
Kyle	24	1	A hundred thousand for a picture of Britney peeing on a ladybug. Imagine what a photo of her crapping on a squirrel is worth!	['crapping']
Butters	20	0	Well this costume was supposed to be for the Easter musical, fellas, not for tryin' to make an easy buck!	[]
Stan	2	0	Oh no.	[]

Guard	2	0	You are?	[]
Butters	6	0	Not me! I'm a squirrel!	[]
Britney	25	0	But now everybody thinks I hate ladybugs. I didn't even know it was there. I can't take it anymore. I'm just sooo-	[]
Guard	16	0	Excuse me, Ms. Spears, but your kids are here and they've brought you a squirrel.	[]
Britney	17	0	My boys? Really? Send them in.  It's okay. My kids are here. I feel better now.	[]
Kyle	4	0	We did it guys!	[]
Stan	6	0	I told you that would work!	[]
The Boys	3	0	Yehehahah, all right!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Ahall right!	[]
Britney	12	0	You mean, it was just a joke? My kids ain't here?	[]
Kyle	8	0	All right. Butters, go get next to her.	[]
Butters	13	0	I ain't doin' it! We tricked her and it wasn't nice!	[]
Stan	13	0	Butters, do you want your share of the hundred thousand dollars or not?	[]
Britney	9	0	You're never gonna leave me alone, are you?	[]
Butters	14	0	It ain't right to take advantage of somebody no matter who they are!	[]
Kyle	9	0	All right, fine! We don't need you, Butters!	[]
Stan	12	0	Yeah, we'll just get a picture of her doing something else.	[]
Cartman	10	1	All right lady, just flash us your crotch or somethin'.	['crotch']
Britney	6	0	I've got a better idea.	[]
Stan	2	0	You do?	[]
Britney	1	0	Yeah.	[]
"Stan, Kyle"	1	0	NO!	[]
Butters	3	0	You killed her!	[]
Guard	6	0	Hey, everything all right u-. Oh.	[]
Nurse	7	0	Paging Dr. Bender? Paging Dr. Bender, please?	[]
Stan	14	0	We should have just left her alone. But we just had to push her.	[]
Kyle	11	0	How could we know she would... Aw we suck so hard.	[]
Doctor	3	0	She's... alive.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Whew.	[]
Stan	3	0	Oh, thank God.	[]
Doctor	14	0	But, we almost lost her. Why couldn't you boys just leave her alone?	[]
Kyle	9	0	Doctor, could we talk to her for a minute?	[]
Doctor	8	0	I don't want you making her upset.	[]
Stan	16	0	We don't wanna upset her, we just want to tell her that we're sorry.	[]
Doctor	2	0	All right.	[]
Doctor	8	0	Ms. Spears, these boys wanted to say something.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Oh my God!	[]
Stan	2	0	Oh no!	[]
Doctor	13	0	The boys are just shocked at how good you look, Britney.  Right, boys?!	[]
Kyle	12	0	Oh, yeah. Yeh-yeah. It's a-it's not even noticeable.	[]
Doctor	9	0	Well, I'll let you boys have your say.	[]

Kyle	6	0	Oh, God, what have we done?!	[]
Announcer	15	0	It's Britney Watch! Keeping you up-to-date with all your Britney Spears news!	[]
Reporter	77	1	You won't believe what Britney's done now. The troubled pop star has just been spotted with a crazy no top part of my head look. This video  was taken just hours ago as Britney was wheeled into the hospital for some reason. And if we zoom in on the footage, right, ri-right here , you can also definitely see a boob job scar. No doubt now that she's had plastic surgery in the past.	['boob']
Anchorman	27	2	O ho ho, oh houch, that's gotta be embarrassing. Chris, any word on why Ms. Spears went for this radical no top of the head look?	['ho', 'ho']
Chris	32	1	No word yet, Tom, but it could be over the embarrassment of the boob job scar video we showed just, just now. Uh, even though the timing doesn't quite work out.	['boob']
Kyle	1	0	Dude!	[]
Doctor	10	1	Damn it, she can't handle any stress right now!	['damn']
Manager	23	0	Excuse me, I'm Britney Spears' manager.  Oh, jeez, Britney! Britney, what were ya thinkin'? First you shave your head and now this.	[]
Britney	1	0	Guglo.	[]
Manager	12	1	Well, it's a ballsy new look, I'll give you that.	['ballsy']
Paparazzo	8	0	Brit! Over here, Brit. One for Star Weekly.	[]
Doctor	19	1	Damn it you have to take her out of here; she can't be around all this right now.	['damn']

Manager	13	0	Yeah yeah, it's like this all the time.  Thank you! Yes, thanks.	[]
Stan	15	0	Look, uh, we feel really bad, and, and we wanna help Britney however we can.	[]
Manager	37	0	That's great, boys. Britney seems to have really taken a liking to you. And don't worry: Britney is a queen at reinventing herself. We just need to get her into the recording studio right away.	[]
Kyle	1	0	What?!	[]
Manager	17	1	All right, Britney, let's take it from the top. Remember to bring that sexiness to it.	['sexiness']
Kyle	14	0	Excuse me, is this really what you think she should be doing right now?	[]
Sound Engineer	10	0	All right, Brit, let's try it from the top.	[]
Female Aide	5	0	God, what a train wreck.	[]
Male Aide	5	0	She must be stoned again.	[]
Stan	15	0	Would you put a stop to this, please? This is only gonna make things worse.	[]
Manager	24	0	Whattaya mean? She sounds great.  Ah, Britney, that last lyric is supposed to be love elation. Sounds more like you're saying love creation.	[]
Britney	1	0	Gogehah.	[]
Manager	7	0	E-la-tion. Really enunciate the L.	[]
Britney	2	0	Egeul-gageol	[]
Sound Engineer	5	0	Gah, she's so stupid.	[]
Stan	15	0	What do you expect?! Look at her! She doesn't have most of her brain!	[]
Sound Engineer	7	0	I know. She's really dumb, huh?	[]
Stan	16	0	No, I mean, she literally doesn't have most of her brain! Her head is gone!	[]
Sound Engineer	7	1	Yeah. And she's all fat, too.	['fat']
Britney	1	0	Okel?	[]
Announcer	11	0	Live, from Las Vegas, it's the MTV Video Music Awards	[]
VJ	30	0	What's up, y'all? It's the MTV Awards and we are kickin' it off right. Here to perform her new song is the one, and only, Britney Spears!	[]
Kyle	5	0	Aw come on now, people!	[]
Woman	8	0	Oh my God, she's really gotten chubby.	[]
Singers	7	0	The way she fee-els.  Love inside.	[]
Man	7	0	Oh man, she's totally lip-syncing.	[]
Stan	6	0	She doesn't have any lips!	[]
Singers	3	0	Temporary.  So hot!	[]
Reporter	41	1	Disaster at the MTV awards. People are ridiculing Britney Spears. Her performance was awful, Tom. She looked tired, she looked fat, she didn't have a head. It was just completely phoned in. No doubt, Tom, that girl has major issues.	['fat']
Manager	30	0	Don't listen to 'em, Brit! They're all just jealous. And we can put you on SlimFast tomorrow.  Hang on, hang on, she'll be out in a minute.	[]
Stan	28	0	We have to get her away from all this, dude. People just aren't gonna let up. We have to take her somewhere to just be at peace.	[]
Kyle	14	0	Dude, where in the world can Britney Spears go where nobody will bother her?	[]
Stan	3	0	I know where.	[]
Stan	8	0	We want three tickets to the North Pole.	[]
Clerk	11	1	The North Pole?  Who the hell goes to the North Pole?	['hell']
Stan	8	0	We do. Me, my friend, and his aunt.	[]
Announcer	4	0	It's Britney Wowtch!	[]
Ron	27	0	A distraught Britney Spears has apparently disappeared and abandoned all those close to her. A local housewife caught a photo of Britney running away in this disguise!	[]
Robert Pooner	30	0	Britney is obviously very upset about her MTV performance, Ron, and so she's become desperate. Most troubling for her is the fact that her disguise has total camel toe.	[]
Ron	2	0	Oooooh, ouch!	[]
Anchorwoman	13	0	Oh boy, now, Leslie, this seems like a really bad camel toe offense.	[]
Leslie	30	0	Absolutely major camel toe, Tracy. Britney just seems oblivious. She was bound to get noticed: you walk around with that kind of cam toe and you're gonna turn heads.	[]
Ron	13	0	Eh, David, any idea as to how big the camel toe actually was?	[]
Robert Pooner	33	0	She was sportin' toe like never before, Brian. I, I don't know what's wrong with that girl, but, it's a slap in the face to camels all over the planet.	[]
Ron	23	0	Those close to Britney say they are very worried and want to bring her home safe. And now back to the local news.	[]
Tracy	31	0	The giant squirrel which was picked up last week by animal control apparently now thinks it's a person. Colorado officials have taken the squirrel to Johns-Hopkins for psychiatric evaluation.	[]
Ron	6	1	Hm, that squirrel is obviously nuts.	['nuts']
Kyle	13	0	Platform 4F. Uhhh, it must be on the other side of the station.	[]
Paparazzo	6	0	There she is! It's Britney!	[]
Stan	2	0	Oh no.	[]
Stan	8	0	Dude, they're never gonna let us through.	[]
Kyle	7	0	Yes they are! I have an idea.	[]
Paparazzo 2	5	0	Britney? Where'd she go?	[]
Paparazzo 3	3	0	There she is!	[]
Stan	11	0	It's okay, you'll be in the North Pole soon.	[]
Manager	18	0	There she is. Hey Britney, it's me.  Britney. It's over. What were you runnin' for anyway?	[]
Reporter	9	0	Hey, wait a minute. Where's her camel toe?!	[]
Kyle	7	0	I'm not Britney Spears, all right?!	[]
Paparazzo 5	2	0	Ooo, psych!	[]
Manager	10	0	She must be back at the train station; come on!	[]
Kyle	86	1	Now, wait a minute! Everyone just stop for one minute!  Look, you guys are gonna end up killing her. Can't you see that Britney isn't in any condition to handle this crap anymore? I know watching celebrities go down can be fun. Me and my friends are just as guilty as all of you, but maybe, we'll just, maybe, ...it's time to let this one go. Just this one time, let's, let's all stop before it's too late, huh?	['crap']
Paparazzo 6	12	0	Son, you don't seem to understand. Britney Spears... has to die.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Huh?	[]
Paparazzo 7	10	0	What do you think all this effort has been for?	[]
Manager	9	0	It cannot be stopped. The purpose is too great.	[]
Officer	3	0	She must... die.	[]
Background Singers	6	0	Hetus. Alte omnebus.  Virtu e poquebus.	[]
Narrator	25	0	Little Stanley was tired and hungry. But he knew that for Britney Spears to be safe, he had to get her to the North Pole.	[]
Stan	5	0	You doing okay, Ms. Spears?	[]
Conductor	30	0	It's her. Um no, I'm sure it's Britney Spears;  it looks just like the picture.  You want me to, to what? Yes, I understand.  Rectus. Hoc honebus	[]
Elderly Man	12	0	Hello, I'm Bob Summers, so happy you picked our little town.	[]
Kyle	12	0	What is going on?! Why do you want Britney Spears to die?!	[]
Bob Summers	17	0	Well nobody wants her to die, little boy. We all simply... need her to. Do you understand?	[]
Kyle	1	0	NO!	[]
Paparazzo 8	14	0	Look, kid, throughout history people have found it necessary to engage in... human sacrifice.	[]
Bob Summers	24	0	In ancient times, humans would commonly pick one lovely girl, adorn her with jewels, treat her like a goddess, and then... watch her die.	[]
Paparazzo 9	28	0	We like to think we're more civilized now, but the truth is our lust for torture and death is no different than it was in gladidator times.	[]
Paparazzo 10	17	0	Only difference is that now we like to watch people put to death through magazines and photographs.	[]
Canadian Paparazzo	25	1	It's a damn shame too. Old ways were bettah. Used to be we just picked someone by lottery and then stoned them to death.	['damn']
Woman	12	0	Stonin' to death was too violent. Rather have the sacrifice kill itself.	[]
Kyle	11	0	You mean everyone has been wanting Britney Spears to kill herself?	[]
Man	18	0	Britney was chosen a long time ago, to be built up and adored, and then sacrificed. For harvest.	[]
Paparazzo 11	6	0	All right, everyone's about here.	[]
Kyle	9	0	Who's everyone?! Who all is in on this?!	[]
Male passenger	8	0	Hey, where are we? This isn't right.	[]
Stan	2	0	Oh no!	[]
Britney	2	0	Ohhh thoooo!	[]
Stan	7	0	Come on, Britney!  Come on, come on!	[]
Kyle	18	0	Mom, Dad!  They're gonna kill her! They're going to in-. Wait, what are you doing here?	[]
Gerald	9	0	It's okay, Kyle. Just... be a good boy.	[]
Kyle	9	0	Be a good boy? You know all about this?	[]
Stan	8	1	Kyle, what the fuck is going on now?	['fuck']
Kyle	9	0	She's been built up to be sacrificed, Stan!	[]
Stan	3	0	Sacrificed? For what?	[]
Randy	10	0	For harvest, Stanley. Same reason we've always done it.	[]
Canadian Paparazzo	7	0	Sacrifice in March, corn have plenty starch.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Corn harvest!	[]
Randy	34	1	We haven't told you about it, Stanley, because we, we like to wait until kids are a little older to talk to them about things like condoms and ritualistic human sacrifice for harvest.	['condoms']
Stan	11	0	All right, enough already! This has all gone on long enough!	[]
Manager	10	0	The kid is right. This has gone on too long.	[]
Paparazzo 12	12	0	Yeah. She was supposed to have killed herself a long time ago.	[]
Farmer	5	0	And harvest is coming soon.	[]
Bob Summers	8	0	All right, folks, let's finish this quickly.	[]
Stan	2	0	No wait.	[]
Woman 2	4	0	Come on, hurry up.	[]
Woman 3	13	0	I can't run. You go ahead, I'll catch up with ya.	[]
Mother	2	0	Here Davey.	[]
Bob Summers	2	0	Hold on.	[]
Doctor	3	0	She's dead.	[]
Randy	14	0	Well, I think it's time for us to leave the poor girl alone.	[]
Gil	2	0	Mornin' Bill.	[]
Bill	2	0	Mornin' Gil.	[]
Gil	3	0	Nice-lookin' corn.	[]
Sheila	6	0	Hey Sharon, Randy, great harvest, huh?	[]
Randy	13	0	An incredible harvest. Some of the best corn I've seen in years.	[]
ET Reporter	39	0	She's the daughter of a country singer, and the young girl has really taken the country by storm. Hannah Montana's Miley Cyrus, though only fifteen years old, is already on her way to being a major superstar.	[]
Jimbo	4	0	Hey, check it out!	[]
Randy	8	0	Looks like next harvest will be even better.	[]
