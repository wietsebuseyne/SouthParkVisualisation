Stan	17	0	Oohh my God, you got splotches on your neck. Are you using any exfoliating products at all??	[]
Cartman	12	0	We can't let Kyle out in public like this, you guys.	[]
Kenny	4	0	(That's the truth.)	[]

Randy	4	2	Not gay, Gerald, metrosexual.	['gay', 'metrosexual']
Gerald	3	0	What's that?	[]
Skeeter	24	1	Just because a guy cares about how he looks and is in touch with his feminine side doesn't mean he's gay anymore.	['gay']
Stuart	12	2	Yeah. Metrosexual means you're straight, but you appreciate the gay culture.	['metrosexual', 'gay']

Cartman	16	0	I'm like, a quarter-bi. My grandpa was bi, so that makes me quarter-bi.	[]
Mr. Garrison	1	0	WHAT??	[]
Mr. Garrison	35	2	It was the craziest thing I've ever seen, Mr. Slave. All the children were suddenly acting like being gay was cool. I mean, maybe we're not the only gay couple in town anymore.	['gay', 'gay']
Mr. Slave	3	0	Oh, Jesus Christ.	[]
Mr. Garrison	9	0	Look at that, Mr. Slave.  Our cup runneth over.	[]

Stan	7	0	Well, what can we do about it?	[]
Cartman	14	0	We have no choice, you guys. We're just gonna have to kill Kyle.	[]
Stan	23	0	What?? That's stupid. We wouldn't have to kill Kyle! We would just to tell him not to hang around us anymore.	[]
Cartman	19	0	Oh, you know, you're right, Stan. We just have to tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore.	[]
Stan	3	0	Yeah. Wait, what?	[]
Cartman	33	0	You hear that, Kenny? Stan thinks we should tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore. I think he's right. Good luck telling him, Stan. I... know it won't be easy.	[]

Kyle	1	0	Stan?	[]
Jason	7	1	This playground is for metrosexuals, macho man!	['metrosexuals']
Craig	9	1	Take your non-flaming ass to some other school!	['ass']
Kyle	2	0	No! Ah!	[]
Sheila	5	0	Kyle! What happened to you?!	[]

Gerald	4	0	Kyle! You look terrible!	[]
Sheila	8	0	The boys at school beat him up, Gerald.	[]
Gerald	36	0	Oh, really?! Well, don't you worry, Kyle. We can cover that black eye up with some cream base, and the coat and pants we'll bleach with an acid wash for a fun vintage look.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Gah! Just leave me alone!	[]
A voice	7	0	There you go! Now you look fabulous.	[]

Chef	4	0	Sure. Come on in.	[]
Mr. Garrison	35	1	Thanks. Come, Slave.  Oh, it's just awful, Chef! I used to feel like an outsider, a totally different person who stood out in this town! Now every straight guy is acting gayer than me!	['gayer']
Mr. Slave	4	0	Oh Jesus! Jesus Christ!	[]
Chef	10	0	Well, what do you want me to do about it?	[]
Mr. Garrison	11	0	Chef, what did you do when white people stole your culture?	[]
Chef	15	0	Oh. Well, we black people just always tried to stay out in front of them.	[]
Mr. Slave	5	0	How did you do that?	[]
Chef	87	0	Well, like with our slang. Black people always used to say, I'm in the house instead of I'm here. But then white people all started to say in the house so we switched it to in the hizzouse. Hizzouse became hizzizzouse, and then white folk started saying that, and we had to change it to hizzie, then in the hizzle which we had to change to hizzle fo shizzle, and now, because white people say hizzle fo shizzle, we have to say flippity floppity floop.	[]
Mr. Garrison	48	1	We don't have time for all that, Chef! Oh, if only those Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people understood what they were doing.  Wait.  That's it! I know exactly what to do!  Come on, Mr. Slave! Let's get back to our flippity floppity floop.	['queer']

Kyle	16	1	I'm going to New York to kill the Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people!	['queer']
Mr. Garrison	7	0	What?? That's what I'm doing!	[]
Kyle	12	0	Oh no! They ruined my life! I get to kill them first!	[]
Mr. Garrison	12	3	They took gay culture from real gays and their asses are ours!	['gay', 'gays', 'asses']
Kyle	5	0	I thought of it first!	[]
Mr. Garrison	8	0	No you didn't! No you didn't!	[]
Kyle	4	0	Did so! Did so!	[]
Mr. Garrison	5	0	I thought of it yesterday!	[]
Kyle	7	0	I thought of it two days ago!	[]
Mr. Garrison	8	0	I thought of it before you were born!	[]
Mr. Slave	14	0	Stop it, you two! Stop it! Don't you see how crazy this is?	[]
Mr. Garrison	12	0	Oh.  You're right, Mr. Slave. We can both kill them together.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Cool.	[]

Gerald	9	0	Hurry, you guys! The mall closes in seven hours!	[]
Jimbo	10	0	Oh, why can't we all live at the mall?!	[]
Sharon	15	1	You know, I'm starting to think this whole metrosexual thing isn't so great.	['metrosexual']
Linda	29	0	I know what you mean. All my husband ever does now is look at himself in the mirror. He cares more about how he looks than how I look.	[]
Mrs. Tweek	13	0	I hope something happens soon to put an end to this whole fad.	[]
Head of Programming	18	1	Guys, you've done a terrific job. Queer Eye For the Straight Guy is our number one show!	['queer']

Mr. Garrison	11	0	Oh, well, the woman at the front desk sent it up.	[]

Stan	3	0	It is not!	[]
Craig	2	0	Is so!	[]
Tom	3	0	Craig! Behave yourself!	[]

Stan	13	0	Dad, Craig is trying to say that his dad can out dress you!	[]
Randy	10	0	What? Son, that's a silly thing to fight about.	[]
Tom	9	0	Yeah. Everyone already knows I dress better than Randy.	[]
Randy	2	0	Oh really?!	[]
Tom	12	0	I mean, you do have the fashion sense of a Japanese woman.	[]
Some men	1	0	Ooooo.	[]
Randy	12	0	Please, girlfriend. You look like some kind of Little Orphan Annie nightmare.	[]
Other men	3	0	Oh no, errrr!	[]
Sharon	25	0	Oh, stop it! Will you all just stop it?!  Look, you guys are carrying this fad too far! Will you please stop acting this way?!	[]
Tom	7	1	You don't... like us being metrosexual?	['metrosexual']
The Women	1	0	NO!	[]
Randy	12	0	Well, you know what I think? I think you're all metrophobic!	[]
The Males	1	0	Yeah!!	[]
Linda	1	0	What?	[]
Jimbo	15	0	We shouldn't be fighting amongst ourselves, we should be uniting against metrophobes like these!	[]
Sharon	3	0	This is crazy!	[]
Randy	17	0	Crazy? Different? Outcasts? Call us what you want. But us metros are real people, just like you!	[]
Tom	13	0	You can metrobash us all you want, but we're here to stay!	[]
Craig	9	0	Yeah Mom! We're proud of who we are.	[]
Cartman	19	1	That's right. Proud. You know what I think, guys? I think we should have a metrosexual pride parade.	['metrosexual']
Ryan	6	1	Great idea, Eric! Raise metrosexual awareness!	['metrosexual']

Jai	10	0	Are you crazy?! We're the hottest thing on TV!	[]
Mr. Garrison	46	1	But don't you see the price? You're selling out your own kind. Look, us gays have created a lifestyle, a, a culture that is uniquely ours. If we keep trying to make straight people into us, well, we're gonna have no identity left.	['gays']
Kyan	4	0	Sorry Charlie, no sale.	[]
Mr. Garrison	24	2	Buh... but... this doesn't make sense!  How can gay men do this to their own people??  Unless... you're not gay at all...	['gay', 'gay']
Thom	9	0	You just had to push it, didn't you?!	[]

The Boys	15	1	We're here!  We're not queer!  But we're close!  Get used to it!	['queer']
Linda	10	0	I should have never wished for a cleaner, neater husband.	[]
Sharon	11	0	Ladies, get your things! I know what we have to do!	[]

Skeeter	6	0	Put it out! Put it out!	[]
Randy	10	0	I can't do anything! These are brand-new pants!	[]
Skeeter	15	0	The heat could really damage our hair. We'd better let the police handle this!	[]

Crab Man 3	2	0	Oh noooo!!	[]
Head of Programming	5	0	Wha? What have you done?	[]
Sharon	44	1	We're sorry, but we didn't have a choice. You see, at first we liked having our men be clean and neat. We thought that having them use product in their hair and wanting facials would make them sexier. But it doesn't.	['sexier']
