Cartman	13	1	All right, this time, it's me and Kenny versus you two assholes.	['assholes']
Kyle	1	0	Fine.	[]
Stan	16	0	Oh, dude, what's with all the homeless people?  Sir, could you move a little, please?	[]
Bum	3	0	Spare some change?	[]
Cartman	12	0	Aw, dude, he smells like Kenny's house.  Get out of here!	[]
Kyle	24	0	You guys, that's not cool. These people have nowhere to go.  They don't have food or shelter. We have to do something.	[]
Stan	8	0	Well dude, what are we supposed to do?	[]
Kenny	7	0	(Yeah, what are we supposed to do?)	[]
Cartman	10	0	No, Kyle's right, you guys. We should do something.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Really?	[]
Cartman	20	0	Yeah. I know what you're thinking, Kyle, and I'm with you. I know exactly what we should do.	[]
Butters	17	0	Gather 'round and witness the glory as Eric Cartman attempts to jump his skateboard over the homeless.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Thank you, thank you.  The ramp ready?	[]
Stan	5	0	Yeah, it's all set.	[]
Clyde	5	0	He won't make it.	[]
Kyle	11	0	Excuse me, this isn't exactly what I had in mind!	[]
Cartman	6	0	All right, here we go! Jimmy?	[]
Bum	2	0	Oh! Aww.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Yes! I did it!  I jumped over the homeless!  Yes!	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Yehes!)	[]
Stan	6	0	That was a sweet idea, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	8	1	God damn it, that wasn't my idea!	['damn']
Mayor McDaniels	24	0	All right, people, we need to come up with answers. There are homeless sprouting up all over town. What are we supposed to do?	[]
Fire Chief	8	0	Well, I, I short of had an idea.	[]
Mayor McDaniels	3	0	Please, Mr. Valmer.	[]
Mr. Valmer	22	0	We could give the homeless all designer sleeping bags and makeovers. At least that way they'd be pleasant to look at.	[]
Other Members	11	0	Oh, that's a good one. Good idea. I like it.	[]
Randy	26	0	Well I was thinking: We could turn the homeless into tires, so that we'd still have homeless, but we could use them, on our cars.	[]
Mr. Valmer	6	0	Ohh, that's a good one.	[]
Mr. Mackey	3	0	Nice one, Randy.	[]
Gerald	2	0	Like it.	[]
Aide	4	0	That's like recycling.	[]
Mrs. Testaburger	24	0	All right, enough! I find this whole conversation to be extremely offensive! The homeless aren't monsters, they are people, like you and me!	[]
Randy	8	0	You mean they've adapted, copied our DNA.	[]
Homeless Advisor	45	0	Excuse me. I am the top researcher of homeless studies for Park County. I don't know why more homeless people are showing up in town, but I do know... that we must be extremely careful. If we give them anything, there could be more.	[]
Kyle	41	0	Hi. I've uh...  I've been saving up for a new Xbox game but... but I think you could use the money a lot more than I could. Listen I, I want you to take this.  It's twenty dollars.	[]
Bum	3	0	Got any more?	[]
Kyle	8	0	No, that... I thought that was a lot.	[]
Bum	3	0	Spare any change?	[]
Kyle	3	0	You're welcome.	[]
Kyle	2	1	Oh crap.	['crap']
Stan	13	0	Dude, what are all these homeless people doing in front of your house?	[]
Kyle	4	0	I don't know.	[]
Cartman	8	0	There's a bunch outside my house too.	[]
Bum	4	0	Spare any change, sir?	[]
Cartman	3	1	No! Fuck off!	['fuck']
Stan	19	0	I don't get it. My Dad said as long as nobody gave them money, they'd move on.	[]
Kyle	2	0	He did?	[]
Cartman	9	1	Well this is bullcrap! Somebody has to be responsible!	['bullcrap']
Kyle	12	0	Well, I... kind of gave a homeless guy twenty dollars last night.	[]
Cartman	2	0	You what?!	[]
Kyle	19	0	Oh c-come on, that can't be why they're all here. There has to be another reason.	[]
Stan	5	0	Kyle, what were you thinking?	[]
Cartman	38	0	Yeah! I can't possibly jump these many homeless people! I won't risk it! I could jump two homeless people, maybe three, but asking me to jump this many is asking me to risk my life, Kyle!	[]
Kyle	9	1	I don't want you to jump them, retard!	['retard']
Bum 1	3	0	Spare some change?	[]
Randy	8	0	No, sorry, I don't have any change.	[]

Bum 7	3	0	Spare some change?	[]
Randy	5	0	I just gave you change!	[]
Bum 8	1	0	Change?	[]
Randy	21	0	Wahhh! I don't have any more change!  Noo! I don't have any change! I don't have any chaaange!	[]
Gerald	22	0	Okay, that'll be great. Let's also make sure we have enough chairs in the community center for everyone to attend.	[]
Randy	6	0	Waaah!  Awwww!  Stay away!  Stay awayhay!	[]
Jimbo	4	0	Randy? Randy, what happened?	[]
Randy	14	0	Stay awa- ...I don't have any change!  I don't have any chaaaahahange!	[]
Announcer	10	1	This is a News 5 Special Bulletin, with Chris Swollenballs.	['swollenballs']
Chris Swollenballs	35	0	South Park has become overrun with the homeless.  Nearly every square inch of public property is now riddled with homeless, shutting down roadways and making getting around impossible.  Many people are trapped throughout the town.	[]
Randy	3	0	Help! Help us!	[]
Stan	5	0	Dude, it's our dads.	[]
Kyle	3	0	Oh my God.	[]
Chris Swollenballs	16	0	In the meantime, South Park citizens are being advised to stay indoors and protect their change.	[]
Bum 9	3	0	Spare some change?	[]
Chris Swollenballs	8	0	What the? You can't be in here.	[]
Bum 9	5	0	Ya got any change, sir?	[]
Chris Swollenballs	13	0	No I don't have any change. How did he get in here?	[]
Bum 10	1	0	Chaaaaange?	[]
Chris Swollenballs	17	0	No, please. I don't have any change. Honest I don't. I don't have any-	[]
Cartman	6	0	You see what you did, Kyle?!	[]
Stan	11	0	Come on, we have to try and help our stupid parents.	[]
Cartman	3	0	They're everywhere!	[]
Aide	7	0	What are you boys doing? Get in.	[]
Bum 11	4	0	Spare any change, sir?	[]
Aide	13	1	Ahhhh!  Come on, let's go!  What the hell were you doing outside?!	['hell']
Stan	11	0	Our parents are stuck on top of a building in town.	[]
Aide	13	0	You aren't getting into town! It's completely overrun with these... things.	[]
The Boys	1	0	Ahh!	[]
Aide	41	0	No! I don't need my windshield cleaned! Stop it! Stop iiit!  Look, our only hope is to talk to the homeless researcher out on Travis Street. He understands what's goin' on better than anybody. Just stick with me, kids.	[]
The Boys	1	0	Aaahhh!	[]
Kyle	3	1	Holy shit, dude!	['shit']
Stan	5	0	Over here!  Jump down! Go!	[]
Cartman	11	0	Aw man, it really smells like Kenny's house down here.	[]
Kenny	8	1	(Dude, shut the fuck up about my house!)	['fuck']
Cartman	9	0	Whoa, Kenny, relax dude. We need to work together.	[]
Stan	10	0	Come on, we gotta get to that scientist's house.	[]
Randy	5	0	No sign of anybody else.	[]
Gerald	11	0	That's it. I'm gonna make a break for it.	[]
Randy	14	0	Don't be crazy, Gerald. You'll never get through all those homeless people.	[]
Stephen	12	0	And even if you did, what then? You can't drive anywhere.	[]
Gerald	19	0	If I can make it through them, maybe I can catch the bus to Fairplay. I have to try.	[]
Randy	7	0	You won't make it through, Gerald!	[]
Gerald	2	0	Ahh. Ahhhahhahahahh.	[]
Bums	7	0	Change? Change sir? You got some change?	[]
Gerald	60	1	Don't have any change... Don't have any change... Damn it! All right, you want change? Here.   There! There's some change. All right, a little bit.  There you go. Take the change.  Oh wait. Wait, now I don't have any change left for the bus. Hold on. Can I just get back some of that change, please?	['damn']
Bum 12	2	0	Change, sir?	[]
Gerald	25	0	Can I have just a little change for the bus, please? I need a little... anybody have some change? Change? Got any change?  Change. Change?	[]
Stephen	2	0	What happened?	[]
Randy	6	0	He's become one of them.	[]
Homeless Advisor	9	0	Go away, I I don't have any change.	[]
Stan	7	0	Are you the head of Homeless Studies?	[]
Homeless Advisor	4	0	Yes. Who are you?	[]
Stan	18	0	We think this may be our friend's fault.  He gave one of the homeless twenty dollars yesterday-	[]
Homeless Advisor	12	0	Oh my God. Get in here! Tell me what's going on?	[]
Stan	23	0	There's a bunch of people trapped in the middle of town surrounded by homeless people. W-we can't get to them.	[]
Cartman	35	0	All right, all right, look! I didn't wanna risk it, but... I think I know what to do. I'll try to jump all those homeless and get to the people on that roof.	[]
Homeless Advisor	2	0	Jump them?	[]
Cartman	24	0	I jump the homeless professionally. If you can get me a skateboard, I'll try to jump that homeless crowd and save those people.	[]
Kyle	13	0	Oh, shut up, Cartman. All you did was jump over one homeless guy.	[]
Cartman	9	0	I easily could have cleared another thirty or forty.	[]
Kyle	7	0	You barely made it over one, fatass!	[]
Stan	14	0	Kyle, enough! Cartman jumping more homeless people isn't gonna solve anything right now!	[]
Kyle	13	1	God damn it! I don't want him to jump over more a-	['damn']
Homeless Advisor	21	0	Boys! Boys! I don't think you quite understand how the homeless function. Perhaps you should come downstairs. To my laboratory.	[]
Randy	8	0	We don't have any change! Go away!	[]
Linda	2	0	Anything, Stephen?	[]
Stephen	8	0	No. All the phone lines are completely down.	[]
A Man	14	0	Hello? Ih-it's Steve Garrett from the library. Pu-please let us in.	[]
Randy	6	0	Find another place to hide, Steve!	[]
Steve	18	0	I I have others with me. We we have nowhere else to go. One woman here is pregnant.	[]
Stephen	8	0	We can't just leave them out there.	[]
Steve	21	0	Let us in! For God's sake, they're coming! No! No, I'm sorry, we don't have any change.	[]
Linda	7	0	You have to let them in, Randy.	[]
Randy	10	0	There isn't enough food for more people up here!	[]
Steve	18	0	Oh God. One of them is a war veteran.  We're gonna have to give him some change.	[]
Stephen	4	0	This isn't happening!	[]
Randy	5	0	All right all right, fine!	[]
Bum 13	6	0	Could you spare some change, sir?	[]
Randy	1	0	Harrrh!	[]
Homeless Advisor	44	0	I've dissected several homeless to see what make them tick. Their anatomy is shockingly similar to ours. See? Everything is there: heart, lungs, kidneys, they're almost identical to us in every way. Except for one.  The homeless... can survive solely... on change.	[]
Bum 14	1	0	Change?	[]
Homeless Advisor	14	0	They feed on our change. They need it in order to keep them moving	[]
Bum 14	7	0	Is that... is that some spare change?	[]
Homeless Advisor	14	0	Somehow they're able to take... our change... and turn it into nourishment, sustenance.	[]
Bum 14	6	0	Spare some of that change, sir?	[]
Homeless Advisor	3	0	But now watch.	[]
Bum 14	3	0	Spare some change?	[]
Homeless Advisor	31	0	It has already completely forgotten that I've given it change. It just wants... more, change. Look over here.  This one I've kept deprived of change for over three days.	[]
Bum 15	1	0	Chaaaaange?	[]
Kyle	4	0	What's it doing?	[]
Homeless Advisor	3	0	It's dying.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Cool.	[]
Homeless Advisor	24	0	I've learned that the nearby city of Evergreen had a homeless problem just before we did. And they were able to stop it.	[]
Gerald	12	0	Excuse me, the front door was open. Can I borrow some change?	[]
Homeless Advisor	16	0	Oh my God, they're coming in!  Quick kids, get out of here! You can fit!	[]
Kyle	3	0	What about you?	[]
Homeless Advisor	18	0	Get to Evergreen and find out how they got rid of the homeless! I'll be all right!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Eh! Stop pushing, Kenny.	[]
Gerald	14	0	Hello?  I I'm sorry, I just really need some change for the bus?	[]
Bum 16	1	0	Change?	[]
Bum 17	3	0	Spare some change?	[]
Bum 18	1	0	Change?	[]
Gerald	7	0	Stop it! I really do need change!	[]
Bum 16	3	0	Me too. Change?	[]
Gerald	7	0	Change?  Hello? Do you have any change?	[]
Bum	1	0	Chaaange?	[]
Homeless Advisor	14	1	Sorry to take the easy way out.  OW! OH, FUCK! OWW!  OHHH! AH! GOD!	['fuck']
Randy	17	1	No. No, damn it!  That's it. That's it, everyone. We're out of Pop-Tarts.	['damn']
Jimbo	5	0	No. We can't be.	[]
Randy	6	0	Face it, we're gonna starve!	[]
Linda	10	0	No, no wait, there's still a box over here.	[]
Randy	4	0	Those are cherry! Ich!	[]
Head of Public Safety	9	0	Wait, I got a signal! I got a signal.	[]
Gerald	3	0	What? You do?	[]
Randy	5	0	How? Call the fire department.	[]
Head of Public Safety	12	0	I'm calling my wife!  Mary. Mary baby, are you all right?	[]
Linda	7	0	Oh, maybe we're gonna be okay.	[]
Stephen	5	0	Ask her what's happening.	[]
Head of Public Safety	30	0	Mary, what's goin' on out there? Nobody's coming for us. They what? No! That's impossible. But how can that be? We didn't even-  Hello? Mary.  Mary!	[]
Jimbo	3	0	What happened, Glen?	[]
Glen	44	0	There's no help coming! She said... because of all the homeless... because of all the homeless in South Park property values have plummeted. I had two liens against my house and so the bank is foreclosing! I don't have a home anymore.	[]
Linda	5	0	Randy, what are you doing?	[]
Randy	8	0	He's homeless now. We aren't safe.	[]
Glen	5	0	I'm not like them.	[]
Randy	9	0	Not yet. It's only a matter of time.	[]
Linda	12	0	And what are you gonna do, huh? Just blow his head off?	[]
Randy	6	0	If we have to! Siddown Glen!	[]
Glen	5	0	Randy, you can't just-	[]
Randy	2	0	SIT... doowwwnnnn!	[]
Glen	81	0	This is crazy. How can they just take away my house? Where am I supposed to put all my things? I don't have a place for all my stuff; where am I supposed to put all my stuff? I'll need to pay for storage. Can I borrow some- money to put my stuff in storage? Come on guys. If you all just help me out a little bit. Each one of you just put in a little... change? Change?	[]
Stan	5	1	What the hell happened here?	['hell']
Man 1	14	1	That's far enough! Just march your butts right back out of our town!	['butts']
Stan	7	0	We, just came to ask a question.	[]
Man 2	4	0	You homeless or homeowners?	[]
Kyle	3	0	We're nine.	[]
Man 1	14	0	Yeah? Well that makes you homeless, so get out of here before you die!	[]
Stan	10	0	Look, we just need help with our own homeless problem.	[]
Cartman	10	1	Yeah. This Jew here made them take over our town.	['jew']
Kyle	3	0	Shut up, Cartman!	[]
Man 1	13	0	Cartman? Eric Cartman? The kid who jumped thirty homeless people on a skateboard?	[]
Cartman	4	0	Youu heard about that?	[]
Man 2	15	0	Heard about it? They said you could have easily cleared fifty homeless with that jump.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Thirty was hard enough.	[]
Kyle	27	0	Oh God! It wasn't thirty, it was one! He jumped over one homeless person with his stupid skateboard, and he barely made it over that guy!	[]
Stan	24	0	Kyle, knock it off! We're here to find out how to get rid of the homeless, not how many homeless Cartman can jump!	[]
Cartman	18	0	Please, we just want you to tell us how you got rid of the homeless in your town.	[]
Man 2	4	0	Well, that was easy.	[]
Man 1	177	0	The homeless first started arriving in Evergreen about three months ago. At first there were only a few of them, askin' for change, sleeping in the parks. But then more showed up, and we realized there was somethin' different about them. They fed off of our change to the point that they could actually start renting apartments. We knew it wouldn't be long before the homeless actually started buying homes. And then we'd have no idea who was homeless and who wasn't! The people living in the house right next door to you could be homeless and you wouldn't even know!  Nobody could trust anybody! Fights broke out. War!  That's when I started suspecting that  my own wife, who I'd been living with for twenty years, was actually homeless. So I had to burn her. In her bed while she slept.  After she died I vowed I wouldn't let the homeless destroy our town! So we came up with a plan to get rid of them once and for all.	[]
Kyle	21	1	You son of a bitch.  You didn't solve your homeless problem, you just sent all your homeless to South Park!	['bitch']
Man 1	4	0	That's right, yes.	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Kyle	19	0	I knew it! It wasn't because I gave that guy twenty dollars! The homeless all came from here!	[]
Man 1	27	0	And it was Texas who sent them to us! People in San Antonio got rid of their homeless by tellin' them what a great place Evergreen was!	[]
Stan	12	0	But then you didn't solve the problem, you just moved it!	[]
Man 1	4	0	Right. But we survived.	[]
Woman	1	0	Dehhhnyihhhs!	[]

Christine	6	0	No! You durned my yits oth!	[]
Dennis	9	0	I have no idea what you're saying!  Ow!	[]
Stan	19	0	Dude, our parents are just as stupid as these people, our town is gonna end up just like this!	[]
Kyle	10	0	No it isn't. Come on, I have an idea.	[]
Stan	13	0	No no, we're not having Cartman jump any more homeless people, Kyle!	[]
Kyle	22	0	That isn't my idea! I saw a bus in a garage a couple of blocks back! We need to modify it!	[]
Kenny	5	0	(What are you gonna do?)	[]
Kyle	12	0	We're gonna save our parents before they all kill each other!	[]
Randy	6	0	A bus! A bus is coming!	[]
Jimbo	15	0	It's the boys! They've modified a bus to get us out of here!	[]
Stephen	8	0	I knew they'd come back for us!	[]
Linda	2	0	All right!	[]
A Woman	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Randy	5	0	Look, Glen. We're saved.	[]
Stan	6	0	All right, I'm turning around	[]
Stephen	4	0	Why are they turning?	[]
Randy	8	0	What are they doing?  Don't leave us!	[]
Kyle	4	0	All right, hit it.	[]
