All the guns have been digitally changed to walkie-talkies. And the word TERRORIST has been changed to HIPPIE.	[]
Stan	7	0	Aw, dude, why would they do that?	[]
Cartman	8	0	Yeah, hippies and terrorists are the same thing.	[]
Kyle	15	0	No, dude. They only changed terrorist to hippie to make E.T. more P.C.	[]
Stan	3	1	That's gay.	['gay']
Announcer	40	0	Coming this summer, it's the motion picture that changed America. Saving Private Ryan, the RE-RE-RELEASE, where the word NAZI has been changed to PERSONS WITH POLITICAL DIFFERENCES, and all their guns have been replaced by walkie-talkies.	[]
Stan	10	1	Why the hell do these directors keep updating their movies?	['hell']

Shlomo	2	1	Sorry, suckers!	['suckers']
Cartman	2	1	You asshole!	['asshole']
Kyle	15	0	Why don't they leave those movies alone? We liked them the way they were!	[]
Tweek	26	0	Don't you see what this means? All our favorite movies are going to be changed, and updated, until we can't even recognize them anymore.	[]
Stan	29	1	Tweek is right. It isn't fair for those asshole directors to keep changing their movies and making them different! Movies are art, and art shouldn't be modified!	['asshole']
Kyle	20	1	Yeah, what if they had modified the Roman Coliseum every year? It would just be another big douchey stadium now.	['douchey']
Stan	10	0	We have to do something. Let's form a club.	[]
Cartman	24	0	Yeah! We can form a club that takes food stamps from poor people and then sells them back to the government for a profit.	[]
Stan	19	0	No, fatass! I mean a club to protect films from their directors, so they can't be messed with!	[]
Kyle	12	0	Yeah. We'll be the Save Films From Their Own Directors club	[]
"Cartman, Stan"	1	0	Yeah	[]
Tweek	43	0	NO! Nono, ah I don't wanna form a club! That's too much pressure! Look, ah-I'm supposed to take it easy; just, watch the clouds, sit on the grass. And, if we form a club there'll be responsibilites. Commitments!	[]
Cartman	22	1	Tweek, now Goddamnit, we picked you to be our new friend to replace Kenny because we thought you were a team player!	['goddamnit']
Tweek	9	0	I'm not! I'm not a team player!	[]
Cartman	15	1	Now, either you stop with these faggotronics or we'll find someone to replace YOU!	['faggotronics']
Tweek	5	1	D'oh-ho! Oh Jesus!	['ho']
Cartman	9	0	Dude, that sign sucks! Nobody's gonna show up!	[]
Stan	6	0	Well what's wrong with it?	[]
Cartman	29	1	Look at it, dude. You're not offering any fabulous prizes. You have to offer fabulous prizes if you want people to show up for your stupid crap. Here.	['crap']
Kyle	2	0	Free hat?	[]
Cartman	12	0	Yeah, if you offer free hats, m-maybe people will show up.	[]
Tweek	6	0	But we don't have hats!	[]
Cartman	9	0	Well we can just make them out of paper.	[]
Tweek	1	0	Aahh!	[]
Cartman	23	0	It's not hard, it's just a stupid little paper hat. People just need free stuff - don't you guys know anything?!	[]
Tweek	19	0	You see?? First we were just forming a club, now we have to make hats! When does it end??	[]
Stan	14	0	Alright, let's go get the gymnasium ready. Tweek, you go make fifty hats.	[]
Tweek	4	0	Fifty hats? Oh Jesus!	[]
Tweek	11	0	Ah! I'll never make it! I'll never make it!	[]
Richard	1	0	Tweek!	[]
Tweek	1	0	Hrrr!	[]
Richard	12	0	Calm down, son. Remember what Dr. Norris told you. Find your center.	[]
Tweek	6	0	My center. My... center.  Calm  Cup?	[]
Cartman	3	0	Tweek!  TWEEK!!  TWEEK!!	[]
Tweek	1	0	Gaaaaah!	[]
Cartman	6	0	How many hats have you made?	[]
Tweek	2	0	Oh God!	[]
Cartman	12	0	We only have until 10 a.m. tomorrow!  Get the lead out!	[]
Tweek	3	0	Aaaah! Oh God!	[]
Tweek	7	0	You guys, we have a big problem!	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Tweek	25	0	I was up, all night, making hats. I only slept for an hour, ...and then I dreamt about making hats, but I only made fifteen!	[]
Kyle	7	0	Calm down, Tweek. Fifteen might be enough.	[]
Stan	20	0	Yeah, let's see if anyone has even shown up yet.  Dude, there's like a thousand people in there!	[]
Tweek	13	0	A thousand?  Oh Jesus man! I don't have nearly a thousand hats!	[]
Cartman	7	1	Then I'mo kick your ass, Tweek!	['ass']
Tweek	1	0	Goohoo!	[]
Kyle	27	0	Wait. It's okay. Look, maybe these people all turned out because they believe in saving films. Maybe they don't even care about the free hats.	[]
Crowd	6	0	Free hat!  Free hat! Free hat!	[]
Tweek	2	0	Oh God!	[]
Cartman	12	0	I told you guys: never underestimate the power of a free hat.	[]
Crowd	4	0	Free hat! Free hat!	[]
Tweek	6	0	I gotta move away, you guys!	[]
Stan	25	0	Relax, Tweek, we're just gonna have to go in there and explain what happened. There are more important things right now than free hats.	[]
Stan	20	0	Okay, uh, we wanna thank you all for coming. We're really happy to see such enthusiasm for our cause.	[]
Crowd	2	0	Yeah! Yeah!	[]
Stan	18	0	Uh, one thing before I continue. Unfortunately we don't have enough of the... free hats for everyone.	[]
Skeeter	3	0	Eh- Excuse me?	[]
Cartman	14	0	Yes, we apologize, but our friend Tweek here didn't make enough of them.	[]
Tweek	9	0	Oh! Jesus! Don't tell them it was me!	[]
Woman	6	0	We don't care about that.	[]
Tweek	3	0	You don't?	[]
Stan	11	0	You mean, you just came because you believe in our cause?	[]
Skeeter	3	0	Yeah. Free Hat.	[]
Tweek	1	0	What?	[]
Man	16	0	Hat McCollough. He was sent to prison in '82, and we believe he should be released!	[]
Man 2	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Crowd	14	0	Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!	[]
Stan	21	0	Aaaah, , okay apparently there's been a bit of a misunderstanding. This is a rally to save films from their directors?	[]
Man	3	0	To do what?	[]
Kyle	20	0	We believe that films are pieces of art that must be preserved from the perverse hands of their agent filmmakers..	[]
Skeeter	13	0	Oh. Sorry. Um, come on, everyone, guess we're in the wrong place.	[]
Crowd	6	0	Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!	[]
Stan	45	0	Waitwaitwaitwait!  Don't you see what's happening out there? The films you all grew up with, that touched YOUR lives and are part of YOUR soul are now being updated and changed. Join us and we CAN be a group that makes a difference!	[]
Skeeter	8	0	Can't we also work towards freeing Hat?	[]
Stan	10	0	Uh, sure, and we'll also try to free Hat.	[]
Some people	4	0	Oh yeeaahhh!! Raaaaah!! Woohoo!!	[]
Crowd	6	0	Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!	[]
Stan	4	0	...212, 213, 214 members!	[]
Tweek	12	0	You guys! You guys! Oh God! Um, I've got terrible news!	[]
Kyle	1	0	What?	[]
Tweek	13	0	Ted Koppel wants us to appear on Nightline to talk about our cause.	[]
Stan	4	0	Really? That's great.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Yah.	[]
Tweek	11	0	No it isn't, man! Thahat's waaay too much pressure!	[]
Stan	18	0	If we go on Nightline, the whole country can hear about what's happening to our classic films.	[]
Cartman	9	0	But just remember that I do all the talking.	[]
Kyle	2	0	You?? Why?	[]
Cartman	11	0	Because I'm the official spokesman. I got dibs on it.	[]
Stan	7	0	When did we do dibs for it?	[]
Cartman	6	0	Just now -  1 2 3 dibs!	[]
Kyle	1	0	Me.	[]
Tweek	2	0	Ga-ahah!	[]
Kyle	15	0	Alright, fine!  You're the spokesman, Cartman! But you'd better not screw it up!	[]
Cartman	5	0	What could possibly go wrong?	[]
Ted Koppel	69	0	A new movement is sweeping the country, led by four determined boys from South Park, Colorado. The organization was created to protect Hollywood's classic films from the hands of their directors. And also to free Hat McCollough. So boys, I ask you the question that's on everyone's minds, why does your organization want to free Hat McCollough, the convicted, confessed serial murderer of twenty-three babies?	[]
Cartman	12	0	...I believe that can best be answered by our official spokesman, Tweek.	[]
Tweek	1	0	Gaaarh!	[]
Ted Koppel	14	0	Well, Hat McCollough admitted he killed those toddlers? Why do you want him free?	[]
Tweek	5	0	Oh, Jesus, man! ...N'ahah!	[]
Ted Koppel	14	0	Just answer me this, Tweek: What do you see as positive about toddler murder?	[]
Tweek	6	0	Ahah. U-uh. It's easy?	[]
Ted Koppel	30	0	Yes... It is easy.  Alright, then on to your other cause, saving films from their directors. What got you boys interested in this, especially given your pro-toddler-murder status?	[]
Kyle	21	0	We believe that films have to be taken away from people like Steven Spielberg and George Lucas because they're insane.	[]
Ted Koppel	18	0	Well I'm glad you said that, boys, because joining us now are Steven Spielberg and George Lucas.	[]
Tweek	3	0	Oh Christ! Wwwaaaaaaah!	[]
Steven Spielberg	2	0	Hello, Ted.	[]
George Lucas	3	0	Oh hi, Ted.	[]
Ted Koppel	20	0	Gentlemen, these toddler-murder fans think you're insane and shouldn't be allowed to alter your films. Your response?	[]
Steven Spielberg	16	0	Well, first of all, both George and I are very firmly against the murdering of toddlers.	[]
George Lucas	3	0	You're here.	[]
Cartman	8	0	Dude, that's Steven Spielberg and George Lucas.	[]
Tweek	12	0	Get me out of here! Please, somebody get me out of heeerre!	[]
Steven Spielberg	32	0	And as for altering our films, all we're doing is trying to reach a... new audience with our movies. As the makers of dreams, we like to speak ...for the children.	[]
Kyle	9	0	Ah, I thought we were speaking for the children.	[]
Cartman	4	0	Yeah, we're children.	[]
Stan	20	0	Uh-look, if the Beatles went back and updated their White Album every few years, what would we have now?	[]
Cartman	9	0	Yeah, these guys are only motivated by money, Ted.	[]
Ted Koppel	2	0	How so?	[]
Cartman	10	3	Think about it. Spielberg? Jew. Lucas? Jew. Kyle? Jew. Coincidence?	['jew', 'jew', 'jew']
George Lucas	5	1	I'm not a Jew!	['jew']
Steven Spielberg	27	0	You little brat-! Ah, I mean, you darling children don't know what you're talking about. Changing E.T. was the best thing I ewver did.	[]
Kyle	19	0	Dude, don't you see that it's not? It'd be like, changing Raiders of the Lost Ark!	[]
Steven Spielberg	7	0	Wait a minute. What'd you say?	[]
George Lucas	4	0	Eh, that's brilliant!	[]
Steven Spielberg	15	0	Yes. Change Raiders of the Lost Ark! Why didn't we think of it before?!	[]
Kyle	2	0	No. NOO!!	[]
Stan	47	0	Members, this is our darkest hour. We've just learned that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg now intend to update and change Raiders of the Lost Ark.  There's only one way we can stop this important and historical piece of art from being harmed. Mr. Secretary?	[]
Cartman	32	0	Thank you.  Our intelligence tells us that the original negative to Raiders of the Lost Ark is currently somewhere in George Lucas's house. We need to find and usurp that negative.	[]
Man 3	15	0	And if we get a hold ot the negative they can't change the movie?	[]
Stan	4	0	That is our understanding.	[]
Woman	19	0	Sounds like a good idea to me. I don't want them to change Raiders of the Lost Ark.	[]
Crowd	1	0	YEAH!	[]
Skeeter	14	0	Yeah! We should go get that negative as soon as we get Hat free!	[]
Crowd	7	0	YEAH!  Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!	[]
Kyle	7	0	Nonono! We need to do this first.	[]
Woman	6	0	But we have to free Hat.	[]
Stan	11	0	It's just that, you know, he killed twenty-three babies.	[]
Man 4	8	0	Well yeah, but it was in self-defense!	[]
Crowd	1	0	YEAH!	[]
Cartman	8	0	He... killed... twenty-three babies in self-defense?	[]
Skeeter	26	0	Hat was attacked maliciously and unprovoked by a gang of babies in West Town Park. When that many babies get together they can be like piranha.	[]
Man 5	16	0	Three eyewitnesses testified that if Hat hadn't killed those babies, they'd have killed him!	[]
Crowd	7	0	YEAH!  Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!	[]
Stan	16	0	Alright alright. But right now we've gotta focus on getting those original prints of Raider	[]
Skeeter	36	0	He's right. We'd better split up. Some of you go with the boys and get those film prints, the rest of us come with me to go talk to the governor about freeing Hat.	[]
Crowd	17	0	YEAH!  Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!	[]
Stan	12	0	Well, it looks like we're gonna have to do this ourselves.	[]
Tweek	16	0	No! Not this! I'm out! I can't deal with the stress you guys create!	[]
Kyle	19	0	We're just gonna fly to California and break into George Lucas's house. What's stressful about that?	[]
Tweek	1	0	Hwaaah!	[]
Cartman	31	0	Okay, Tweek, let me tell you something: You've been our new friend now for two weeks, okay? And I've gotta be honest with you, it isn't going well.	[]
Tweek	1	0	Haaah!	[]
Cartman	40	0	People aren't that into you, Tweek. They find you kind of annoying. Now, I say you've got one last shot here, and I don't want you to blow it, okay? Does that help take the stress off?	[]
Stan	2	0	Okay, go.	[]
Tweek	23	0	I'm breaking into George Lucas's house. I'm not breaking into George Lucas's house. I'm in a green field.	[]
Cartman	9	1	Stop, Tweek! This is not the time for faggocity!	['faggocity']
Kyle	6	0	This looks like the right room.	[]
Tweek	8	0	I'm in a field... surrounded by deer.	[]
Stan	2	0	Over here!	[]
Kyle	3	0	That's it!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Alriiight! Get it, Tweek!	[]
Tweek	2	0	Huh uh.	[]
Cartman	14	1	Get it, you piece of crap, before I grab your nutsack and twist it!	['crap']
Tweek	3	0	Guh huh huh!	[]
George Lucas	4	0	What are you doing?!	[]
Tweek	4	0	Oh God! Oh Jesus!	[]
George Lucas	11	0	You're the boys from that ...stupid club. Give me that!	[]
Tweek	1	0	Aaaaaah!	[]
Kyle	18	0	Do with us what you will, Mr. Lucas!  But please, don't change Raiders of the Lost Ark.	[]
George Lucas	16	0	We're gonna make it better. The movie's gonna be changed, and that's that!	[]
Cartman	19	0	Alright, you asked for it. I'm afraid you leave us no choice. It's time for Plan B.	[]
Stan	2	0	Aw, really?	[]
Tweek	6	0	Oh God, no! Not Plan B!	[]
Cartman	25	0	You have a heart made of ice, Mr. Lucas, and so we're goin' tuh melt your icy heart... with a cool island song. Gentlemen?	[]
George Lucas	1	0	...What??	[]
Cartman	16	0	Hit it, Tweek!  In the tropical isle with the coconut tree, there's a lots of-	[]
Stan	15	0	Waitwaitwaitwaitwait. I thought we were gonna cool his hot heart with a cool island song.	[]
Cartman	6	0	...No, he has an icy heart.	[]
Kyle	11	0	...But you can't melt ice with a cool song, 'tardheart.	[]
Stan	13	0	So we have to warm his icy heart with a hot island song	[]
Cartman	6	0	It's a cool island song.	[]
Kyle	16	0	Well then we're gonna end up freezing his hellish heart with a cool island song.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Oh, do we wanna do that?	[]
George Lucas	4	0	ALRIGHT, that does it!	[]
George Lucas	19	0	Yes, thank you, officer.  The police are on their way, boys.  Soon you'll be in jail getting RAMMED!	[]
Tweek	1	0	Aaaahh!	[]
Stan	20	0	Those rams can do to us what they will, Mr. Lucas, but we'll never stop trying to protect films.	[]
Kyle	27	0	It's not too late to do what's right. Give us the print. There's still some good in you, Mr. Lucas. We know there is.	[]
George Lucas	7	0	It is... too late for me, boys.	[]
Kyle	18	0	You yourself led the campaign against the colorization of films. You understand why films shouldn't be changed.	[]
George Lucas	23	0	M-that's different. These are my movies. I made them, and I have the right to do whatever I want with them	[]
Stan	38	0	You're wrong, Mr. Lucas. They're not your movies. They're ours. All of ours. We paid to go see them, and they're just as much a part of our lives as they are of yours.	[]
Kyle	10	0	When an artist creates, whatever they create belongs to society	[]
George Lucas	15	0	Have I... become so old that I've forgetten what being an artist is about?	[]
Stan	21	0	Give the print to us so that we can protect it from Spielberg and anyone else who wants to alter it.	[]
George Lucas	4	0	Perhaps... you are right.	[]
A Voice	6	0	STOP!  What are you doing, George?!	[]
George Lucas	3	0	Steven, Uh, I-	[]
Steven Spielberg	11	0	Give me that print, George! We need to make the alterations!	[]
George Lucas	17	0	Steven, these boys had a point. I don't remember what it was, but it was good.	[]
Steven Spielberg	21	0	You haven't let these doe-eyed children affect your judgment, have you, George?!  Don't forget: you belong to me.	[]
Kyle	14	0	Don't listen to him! You still have a chance to preserve your film!	[]
George Lucas	7	0	I'm... ah I'm sorry, boys.	[]
Steven Spielberg	5	0	Now take the children prisoner!	[]
Kyle	1	0	What??	[]
Steven Spielberg	25	1	You troublemakers shall be my guests of honor at the premiere of the NEW Raiders of the Lost Ark! Your gay little club is over!	['gay']
Stan	8	1	Fuck you, Steven Spielberg! Come on, you guys!	['fuck']

Announcer	68	1	Coming, this summer!  It's the digitally-enhanced re-release of the very first pilot episode of South Park!  Yes, the classic, rough, hand-made first episode is getting a make-over for 2002!  The simple, funny aliens are now super-badass and kewl!  Flying saucer? No longer cheap construction paper, but a 4.0 megapixel constructed through a masterpiece of technology! Everything's new! New is better!	['badass']
Trey Parker	21	0	When we first made South Park, we didn't wanna use construction paper. We just had to because it was cheap.	[]
Matt Stone	18	0	And now with new technology we can finally remaster South Park, make it look sharp, clean and focused.	[]
Trey Parker	1	0	Expensive.	[]
Announcer	24	0	Yes, all the charm of a simple little cartoon  will melt before your eyes as it is replaced by newer and more standardized animation!	[]
Trey Parker	29	0	For instance, in the scene at the bus stop, we always meant to have Imperial walkers and giant dewback lizards in the background, but simply couldn't afford it.	[]
Announcer	17	0	Get this special enhanced version quick, because another enhanced version will likely be coming out for 2003!	[]
Tweek	25	0	Members, uuhh, oh Jesus, uh, we have to do something! Our club president , treasurer , and secretary  have all been taken hostage be Steven Spielberg! Haaa!	[]
Man 3	5	0	Prisoner? You mean, like Hat?	[]
Tweek	4	0	Yes, just like hat!!	[]
Skeeter	16	0	But the governor won't pardon Hat. So how can we get him out of prison?	[]
Tweek	68	0	No! Listen to me! We're not talking about Hat right now, okay?! Gad!! Look, we went to George Lucas's house a-and tried to melt his icy heart with a warm island song, but then Spielberg showed up and took three of our members prisoner! They're goin' to premiere their new Raiders of the Lost Ark, and we have to rescue them! Do you understand?!	[]
Woman	7	0	Hey, he's got a point there.	[]
Man 6	15	0	Yeah... Maybe we could melt the governor's icy heart with a cool island song!	[]
Members	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Tweek	1	0	No!	[]
Skeeter	1	0	No?	[]
Man 7	16	0	No! He's right. We have to freeze his hot heart with a cool island song.	[]
Woman	12	0	Or is ti freshen his hot temper with a cool island song?	[]
Man 8	11	0	Let's cool his hot temper with a fresh island song.	[]

Steven Spielberg	6	0	The kid? The tweaked out kid?!	[]
Tweek	8	0	I'm gonna blow up the print, Spielberg!	[]
Steven Spielberg	5	0	Your pesistence surprises even me.	[]
Francis Ford Coppola	11	0	Surely you don't think you can escape from this premiere.	[]
Tweek	17	0	That depends on how reasonable we're all willing to be. All I want are my friends.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Wow.	[]
Tweek	7	0	Except for Cartman - you can keep him.	[]
Cartman	1	0	AY!	[]
Francis Ford Coppola	4	0	And if we refuse?	[]

Kyle	17	0	Do you think we did a good thing, Stan?  I mean, no one even seemed to notice.	[]

Cartman	7	0	That and youth. Those guys are old.	[]
Tweek	23	0	But what about the original prints of Raiders of the Lost Ark? What if somebody else takes them and tries to change them?	[]
Stan	15	0	Don't worry, Tweek. It's somewhere safe. Somewhere where... nobody will ever find it.	[]
