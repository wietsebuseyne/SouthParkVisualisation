Cartman	10	3	Tourette's Syndrome? What is that, Mommy. Butthole! Titties! Balls!	['butthole', 'titties', 'balls']

Kyle	2	0	Grrhh, whatever.	[]
Cartman	5	1	Good morning, Mr. Mackey. Asspussy!	['asspussy']
Craig	13	1	If I could say asspussy to the counselor I would be sooo happy.	['asspussy']
Mrs. Garrison	12	0	Okay, so what do we get when we multiply a negative number-?	[]

Mrs. Garrison	23	0	Principal Victoria, it's just that Eric has become such a distraction I, I don't think I can teach my class anymore.	[]
Principal Victoria	22	0	I understand it's been difficult, Mrs. Garrison, and so, Mr. Donaldson has come from the Tourette's Tolerance and Understanding Foundation.	[]
Mr. Donaldson	16	2	Hello Mrs. Garrison-  Ass. ASS.  I want to help your class better understand this illness.  Piss!	['ass', 'ass']
Kyle	4	0	No! Up yours, fatboy!	[]
Cartman	5	0	Kyle please! I'm sorry!	[]
Kyle	19	0	Principal Victoria, there's something you need to know! Cartman's Tourette's isn't real! He's faking!	[]
Mr. Donaldson	9	0	Faking?  You think people with Tourette's are faking?!	[]
Kyle	9	0	N-no, I'm just saying that I think-	[]

Mr. Donaldson	28	1	Kids, today during therapy class we have a special visitor.  ASS!  I, I wanted him to meet all of you so he could try to understand Tourette's	['ass']
Teen Boy	19	0	Tourette's is like a cough or a sneeze.  Brrrrr!  It isn't contagious like some people think.  Brrrrrrrrr!	[]
Blonde Girl	34	0	A lot of people with Tourette's have different tics. My tic  is that I have to bend my neck and snap her fingers. But a lot of people don't even notice it.	[]
Thomas	3	2	Aw shit! COCK!	['shit', 'cock']
Brunette	22	0	Sometimes it can be embarrassing to have Tourette's, but I  Boop. I've learned I shouldn't be mad at myself.	[]
Mr. Donaldson	14	2	You see? These kids can't control their actions. Ass! Piss in the ass!	['ass', 'ass']
Kyle	22	0	L-look, I was just suggesting that maybe this one person could control what he said, but just didn't, for fun.	[]
Teen Boy	11	0	Fun?  Brrrrr!  This really isn't all that fun.  Brrr, brrrrrr!	[]

He... divorced my mom, s-said he'd still be around, but I only see him at Christmastime now. S-sh-shit! S-sh-shit! The worst part is I know how lonely my mom is. A lot of times I know she'd be better off if I was dead.	['shit', 'shit', 'shit']

Kyle	3	0	Aw, come on!	[]
Mr. Donaldson	9	0	So then you apologize for what you said before?	[]
Kyle	19	0	Ah I was just trying to... just, just in one instance... No. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.	[]
Mr. Donaldson	29	0	Well, Mr. and Ms. Broflovski, I think your son has learned a lot, and he appears to be honestly remorseful for making fun of people with disabilities.  Piss! PISS!	[]
Sheila	17	0	Our son is a good kid. He just didn't understand Tourette's was a real disease.	[]
Mr. Donaldson	18	0	Well, I think the only thing left now is for your son to apologize to his little classmate.	[]
Gerald	2	0	Well Kyle?	[]
Kyle	3	0	I'm sorry.	[]

I've managed not only to get away with saying whatever I want at school, on the bus, at the dinner table, but this Saturday I will actually say anything I want... on national television. I'm going to blast the Jews, Kyle. I'm going to call them every name in the book, and people will call it brilliant television. They'll probably give me an Emmy.	['jews']
Kyle	27	1	You are not going to go on national television and spew a bunch of hate speech about Jewish people! I won't let you do it, Cartman!	['jewish']
Cartman	6	0	Then the game is on, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	16	0	It's not a game, you derelict! And this isn't Scotch! It's apple juice!	[]
Cartman	42	3	Do you have any idea how liberating it is to say whatever comes to mind? Big titties! Buttmunch! There's no walls anymore! Shit! Whatever enters my brain I can just say without thinking about it. I wet my bed last night.	['titties', 'buttmunch', 'shit']

Butters	3	0	Uh hey Eric!	[]
Cartman	42	0	Butters, do you think it's possible that you can lose the ability to filter what you say? I mean, if somebody got used to saying whatever came to their mind, could they start saying things that they would normally never say?	[]
Butters	6	0	Wuh who are you talking about?	[]
Cartman	14	1	Uh, my cousin. My cousin one time my cousin and I touched wieners.  Wah!	['wieners']

Se we tracked him down to his hoouuse. And you know what he did? He shot himself.  It'd be a shame if... you didn't wanna go on Dateline. Be a shame if we had to track you down and you shot yourself.

You can't just walk around saying whatever you want. You gave us a filter because, people don't wanna hear things like I touched penises with my cousin!  Ahaab, ahaabuh. And, and I learned, you especially can't say whatever you want on national television, 'cause, there could be kids watching. Please, God, don't make me embarrass myself on national television.
