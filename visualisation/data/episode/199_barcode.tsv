Stan	10	2	Dude, fuck Facebook! Seriously!  What the hell is this?! Podcast?	['fuck', 'hell']
Cartman	233	0	Welcome to Cartman's Incredible Podcast!  Hello fellow Facebookers, I'm here to do one thing: get you more friends!  Looking around Facebook today we see that since adding loser Kip Drordy as a friend, Kyle Broflovski's stock is plummeting! He had 55 friends just two days ago, he's down to just 11 this morning. Run to your Facebook account and delete Kyle from your friend list because he is poison and I don't see him making a comeback any time soon.  You're gonna want to dump Kyle and if at all possible add Clyde Donovan. Why?  Birthday! That's right, Clyde has a birthday coming up and his mom is taking everyone to Casa Bonita.  If you don't have Clyde as a friend, you're gonna want to add him, because Clyde's numbers are about to go way up! And now, Word On The Street.  The rumors are now becoming more than that; Jimmy and Bebe have agreed to share their friends. That's right. Looks like we're about to have a merger  So if you're a friend of Jimmy's you're about to luck into about 90 chick friends, and as we all know, chick friends are worth almost triple what dude friends are. That's all the time I have for today. Remember, update that profile, and steer clear of Kyle.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Can I come in?	[]
Stan	7	0	Sure dude.  Dude, what's the matter?	[]
Kyle	6	0	I... don't... have... any... friends...	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Kyle	75	0	I mean, I do, but, well, ever since I became friends with that Kip Drordy kid, a bunch of my other friends have started ignoring me. It would be fine except for my farm is starting to shrink. I know that I should just dump Kip as a friend, but that's such a terrible thing to do and, I'm sorry I'm just so confused I... I really need a friend right now.	[]
Stan	9	0	Okay dude, I'm I'm here for you.	[]
Kyle	10	0	'K, so then get on Facebook and fertilize my crops?	[]
Stan	1	0	NO.	[]
Kyle	9	0	Pleahehese! My farm hasn't expanded in three days!	[]
Stan	38	0	Dude, I've already had to become friends with all of Wendy's frends and my grandma's friends! I do NOT want to start doing all the farming stuff too! I'm not getting sucked into that!	[]
Kyle	16	0	You don't get sucked into it! You don't get sucked in at all! Plehehehehehehehese!	[]
Stan	2	1	Ah fuck.	['fuck']
Stan	8	0	Okay it says I'm at your farm.	[]
Kyle	32	0	'Kay, so now just click on the little soil button...  and then maybe put a sign up to comment on my farm...  Okay, now I can read the sign you put up...	[]
Stan	11	0	'Kay, it says you and I are now very good friends.	[]
Kyle	12	0	Yeah. We're very good friends. We're very good friends, Stan!	[]
Kip's Dad	11	0	So Kip, you spend more time with your buddy Kyle today?	[]

Kip's Dad	7	0	Sounds like you boys had a ball!	[]
Kip	23	0	Mom, Dad, I'm all done. Can I go hang out with Kyle and tell him all about what I had for dinner?	[]
Kip's Dad	10	0	Well it's a little late, but it is Friday.	[]
Kip's Mom	13	0	I thnk the more time you spend with your little friend, the better.	[]

Cartman	33	0	You're very smart, Kyle. But the truth is, as long as you have that Kip Drordy loser as a Facebook friend, people view your friendship as a liability. You gotta dump him.	[]
Kyle	11	0	I can't do that, I'd just feel too bad.	[]
Cartman	27	0	Well Kyle, then what you have to do is go outside the normal circles and try to make friends with people who've never heard of Kip.	[]
Kyle	19	0	I've been trying! But I just don't know how to make totally new friends on the Internet.	[]
Cartman	15	0	It's not as hard as it sounds, Kyle. Have you ever heard of chatroulette?	[]
