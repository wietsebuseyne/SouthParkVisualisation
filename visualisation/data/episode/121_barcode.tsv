Linda	18	0	Thanks so much for coming to visit Butters in the hospital, boys. It means a lot to him.	[]
Stephen	5	0	What happened to him, Doctor?	[]
Dr. Doctor	82	1	From the test results, it would appear your child was tortured by a bully. He received a massive snuggie, his underwear pulled up so high it nearly killed him. He also received two Indian sunburns on his forearms, a charlie horse on the thigh, and a second-degree titty twister. And from the damage to his head area, it appears he was also given a swirly, a colossal one.  It also looks like he received a noogie, and, a Polish bike ride.	['titty']
Linda	3	0	What's that?	[]
Dr. Doctor	12	0	We aren't sure. We only know that... there is no cure.	[]
Linda	22	0	If only we had let him in!  Why didn't we let him inside the house when he was screaming for help??	[]
Stephen	7	0	Now, honey, we were trying to read.	[]
Cartman	20	0	We've got to tell them who did this, you guys. We're gonna get it as bad as Butters!	[]
Kyle	23	0	That's nothing compared to what my mom will do to me if she finds out I've been lying for five years!	[]
Cartman	14	1	Maybe you didn't hear so good in there, Kyle! Second-degree titty-twister!	['titty']
Stan	22	0	Calm down guys, we don't have to go tell our parents. We just need to go out and get some protection.	[]
Cartman	13	2	How the hell are condoms gonna help us?!  Sorry, heh. Never mind, hehe.	['hell', 'condoms']
Stan	16	0	I'm talking about hiring somebody bigger than Trent to protect us from him. Come on!	[]
Sixth Grader 1	12	0	I'm gonna jump the wall of fire.  Yeah, that was sweet!	[]
Sixth Grade Leader	2	0	Hey, look!	[]
Kyle	6	0	Dude, we shouldn't be here!	[]
Stan	16	0	Stay cool, guys. If anybody can protect us from Trent Boyett, it's the sixth graders.	[]
Sixth Grade Leader	12	0	Stupid little Fourthies!  What are you little Fourthies doin' in our hangout?!	[]
Stan	8	0	We've come to... ask you for help.	[]
Sixth Grade Leader	1	0	Help?!	[]

Sixth Grade Leader	8	0	Yeah? And what do we get for it?	[]
Cartman	43	0	A twelve-pack of Dr. Pepper, A Shoots & Ladders game used only three times, DVD of Harry Potter 2, and a coupon for a free side of fries with a purchase of any deluxe hamburger at Red Robin.  All this can be yours.	[]
Sixth Grade Leader	10	0	You're gonna have to do better than that, Fourthies!	[]
Kyle	6	0	Well...  Well, what do you want?	[]
Sixth Grade Leader	5	0	You're Stan Marsh, right?	[]

Sixth Grader 3	9	1	Yeah! I totally wanna suck your mom's tits.	['tits']
Stan	2	0	Dude, weak!	[]
Sixth Grade Leader	9	0	Come back with a naked picture of your mom!	[]
Stan	1	0	No!	[]
Sixth Grade Leader	6	0	Then we aren't helpin' you!	[]
Kyle	5	0	Wait! We'll do it.	[]
Sixth Grade Leader	12	0	It'd have to be a good picture, too!  So long, Fourthies!	[]
Cartman	16	0	Okay, so now we just need to get a picture of Stan's mom naked. Cool.	[]
Woman 1	26	0	That's the preschool teacher, Ms. Claridge. Poor woman suffered such horrible burns she can only communicate by... beeping once for yes and twice for no.	[]
Woman 2	9	0	Oh hello, Ms. Claridge. Nice day, isn't it?	[]
Man 2	11	0	Need help across the street, Ms. Claridge?  Well all right then.	[]
Man 3	51	0	Ms. Claridge, you all right?  You can talk to me, Ms. Claridge. I understand: one beep for yes and two for no. Don't you think you should get out of the street?  Look you, you don't have to be so cold. I'm just trying to help.  Oooo, sorry!	[]
Trent	6	0	Can Kyle come out and play?	[]
Sheila	8	0	Oh, Kyle isn't home right now, hon.	[]
Trent	4	0	Thank you, ma'am.	[]
Stan	21	0	You see, Mom, all the kids at school were told to bring a picture of their moms' breasts for anatomy class.	[]
Cartman	18	0	I don't know, son. That sounds awfully strange.  You cannot have a picture of my hot breasts.	[]
Stan	5	0	But mom, my teacher will-	[]
Cartman	9	0	Nononono, you gotta go  But Mo-o-o-om.	[]
Stan	4	0	But Mo-o-o-	[]
Cartman	5	0	But Mo-o-o-om.	[]
Stan	3	0	This is hopeless!	[]
Kyle	20	0	Why don't you just sneak in your mom's closet and get a picture when she's changing clothes?	[]
Stan	15	1	That's sick, dude! I'm not taking a picture of my mom's boobs!	['boobs']
Kenny	4	0	(I'll do it.)	[]
Stan	22	1	No, you're not doing it either! We just need to find something that looks like boobs to take a picture of.	['boobs']
Kyle	7	0	What else has big round squishy globes?	[]
Cartman	15	0	Draw the um- You guys draw the nipples like on the bottom of my asscheecks.	[]
Kyle	9	0	No, the nipples are more in the middle, see?	[]
Cartman	17	0	Yeah, but Stan's mom is old; that means her nipples... sag more to the bottom now.	[]
Stan	4	0	How do you know?!	[]
Cartman	9	0	Will you guys trust me? I know this stuff!	[]
Stan	3	0	All right, fine.	[]

Sixth Grade Leader	15	0	We... told him not to mess with you guys... We told him... you paid us.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Oh, Jesus. You told him that?!	[]
Dr. Doctor	16	0	Boys, you have to let him rest. Some mean kid gave him a Texas Chili Bowl.	[]
Stan	3	0	What's that?	[]
Dr. Doctor	40	1	It involves Tabasco sauce, a telephone, and the anus.  I don't know what kind of kid would do this to other people; I only know that I wouldn't ever want to be on that kid's bad side.	['anus']
Stan	12	0	We're dead. Trent knows we sent the sixth-graders after him.	[]
Cartman	9	0	He's gonna give us all Texas chili bowls.	[]
Kyle	17	0	We've gotta move away. We've gotta get as far away from this town as possible!	[]

Stan	1	0	Shelly?	[]
Shelly	7	1	Shut up, turd! I'm watching television!	['turd']
Stan	12	0	Shelly, you're my sister, right? And families... depend on each other.	[]
Shelly	12	0	I said shut up, or I will destroy you, tur-r-rd!	[]
Stan	29	0	Shelly  Somebody is going to kill me, and I can't go to Mom or Dad for help, so, you're kind of the only person I have... left.	[]
Shelly	9	1	Stop crying, turd! Now, who's gonna kill you?	['turd']
Stan	23	0	Trent Boyett. He just got released from Juvenile Hall. He was sent there for burning Ms. Claridge, but actually, it was our fault.	[]
