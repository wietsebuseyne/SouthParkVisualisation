Jimmy	2	0	Hey fellas.	[]
Stan	5	0	Oh hey Jimmy, hey Timmy.	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmy!	[]
Jimmy	31	0	Say fellas, Jimmy and I were wondering if maybe you would come and cheer for us next S-S-Saturday. We're both competing in the Special Olympics down in Denver.	[]
Cartman	9	0	The Special Olympics? What's so special about them?	[]
Kyle	7	0	They're Olympic games for handicapped people.	[]
Cartman	1	0	What?	[]
Jimmy	10	0	Timmy and I are competing in a variety of events.	[]
Stan	10	0	Yeah sure, we'll come cheer you and Timmy on.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Yeah, that'd be cool.	[]
Jimmy	28	0	Thanks a lot, fellas. Well, we gotta get down to the training center and start working out. Word is we have a lot of sssstiff competition this year.	[]
Kyle	10	0	Well all right, we'll see you on Saturday, guys.	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmy!	[]
Cartman	23	1	Dude. I can't believe they exploit handicapped people like this. I mean, making them compete against each other just for our amusement.	['amusement']
Kyle	5	1	...You're an asshole, Cartman.	['asshole']
Cartman	5	0	What? What'd I do?	[]
Jimmy	3	0	S-s-six!	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmih.	[]
Jimmy	4	0	S-s-s-ssseven!	[]
Timmy	2	0	Timmih. Timmih!	[]
Jimmy	3	0	S-s-seven!	[]
Timmy	2	0	Timmih! Timmih!	[]
Jimmy	67	0	Ni- I can- I can't!  Huff. Oh man.  Gee whiz, Timmy. It looks like we have some pretty stiff competition this year.  All of the special athletes seem to be in tip-top condition, and I can't even get past seven ru-reps. Hoh well, that's it for me, Timmy. I'm p-p-p-pooped. I'll see you in the locker room.	[]
Timmy	1	0	Otimmih.	[]
Francis	7	0	Hey Jimmy, g-good luck on Saturday.	[]
Jimmy	3	0	You too, Francis.	[]
Nathan	2	0	Hey Jimmy.	[]
Jimmy	5	0	Oh he-hey, N-Nathan.	[]
Nathan	8	0	So uh, I see you train pretty hard.	[]
Jimmy	25	0	Yeah, it sure is tough. I'm training really hard, but I'm not improving fast enough, and the Special Olympics are a... week away.	[]
Nathan	13	0	Weeell uh, maybe I can help you out. You know, there are shortcuts.	[]
Jimmy	4	0	What kind of shortcuts?	[]
Nathan	3	0	You know. Steroids.	[]
Jimmy	11	0	S-s-ss-s-s-steroids?  ...But aren't those illegal?	[]
Nathan	15	0	Yeah, sure, but these are new. They don't show up in our urine tests.	[]
Jimmy	9	0	So uh, ha-how do they... w-w-work?	[]
Nathan	25	0	You just take one of these little blue babies  three times a day  and inject this directly into your bloodstream  twice a day before meals.	[]
Jimmy	6	0	How much would this cost me?	[]
Nathan	18	0	Uuuh, it isn't cheap. I've gotta keep vice off my back and secure shipments from overseas.	[]
Jimmy	20	0	Well... then maybe I'll just use them a-al-little bit. You know, as a per-formance en... hancer.	[]
Nathan	10	0	Oh, whatever you say, Jimmy my friend.  Whatever you say.	[]
Cartman	15	0	You guys! You guys! I have the best idea ever! I'm gonna be rich!	[]
Kyle	1	0	What?	[]
Cartman	36	1	Dude, I was just looking at the Special Olympics brochure, and check this shit out: At the end of the Special Olympics, a Grand Champion Special Athlete is crowned and given a cash prize of $1000	['shit']
Stan	1	0	So?	[]
Cartman	25	0	So?! So, dude, think about it. If somebody just pretended to be mentally handicapped, they could easily win the competition and get the thousand bucks!	[]
Kyle	4	0	Oh no. Cartman, no!	[]
Cartman	26	1	It's flawless! I'll act like I have a disability, and when the time come to compete I'll kick ass against all the handicaps!	['ass']
Stan	6	0	That's really, really terrible, dude.	[]
Cartman	20	0	Terrible?? Whatever! You guys' brains just can't compute complex plans like mine can! It'll work, you'll see.	[]
Kyle	17	0	Cartman! I will not stand by and let you cheat your way to winning the Special Olympics!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Why?	[]
Kyle	1	0	Because!	[]
Cartman	65	0	What are you gonna do, Kyle?! Tell on me?!  Then you'll be a great big no-good double-faced poopy-pants tattle-tale!  Is that really how you deal with your problems?! Grow up, Kyle!  All I have to do is make people think I'm handicapped, and I get a thousand dollars. It won't be easy, but nothing worth having ever is.	[]
Cartman	12	0	Daaaarrrr. Duuuuurrrr. I wanna be in the Special Olympics.  Bull's eye!	[]
Jimmy	6	0	Oh! Agh! Ju-just a second!	[]
Dad	1	0	Jimmy?	[]
Jimmy	7	0	Hang on, I'm-I'm, coming.	[]
Dad	5	0	Jim, it's your father!	[]
Jimmy	13	1	I said I'm coming! Give me a Goddamned s-second!  Hold it.	['goddamned']
Dad	4	0	Jimmy, were you masturbating?	[]
Jimmy	3	0	N-no, Dad.	[]
Dad	6	0	Okay. Well, you have a visitor.	[]
Girl	2	0	Hi Jimmy.	[]
Jimmy	5	0	Oh. Hi, N-N-Nancy.	[]
Nancy	11	0	I was hoping we would study for the spelling test tomorrow.	[]
Jimmy	6	0	Oh. Sure thing. Come on in.	[]
Dad	9	0	I didn't know you had a girlfriend, Jim.	[]
Jimmy	15	0	Yeah, Dad. We've been going out since we met in Free Period last week.	[]
Dad	20	0	I'll leave you two alone.  Y-You sure you weren't masturbating, Jim? It's okay if you were.	[]
Jimmy	4	0	Dad, Jesus C-Christ!	[]
Dad	2	0	Okay, then.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Drrrrrrey drrrrrrrey.  Hey guys, what's going on? Drrrrr.	[]
Kyle	3	1	God damn you!	['damn']
Cartman	25	0	You see, gentlemen? The Special Olympics Championship and my one thousand dollars is just four days away.  I'm going to go sign up now.	[]
Kyle	29	0	No you're not!  I read the brochure, Cartman! If you're under eighteen, you have to have a parent with you to sign up for the Special Olympics.	[]
Cartman	1	0	What?!	[]
Kyle	29	0	It says right there a parent has to be with you to sign up, and you'll never get your mom to agree to something so horrible, so ha!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Moooommmm?	[]
Liane	2	0	Yes, hon?	[]
Cartman	10	0	Um, could I get you to do something for me?	[]
Liane	4	0	What's that, hon?	[]
Cartman	43	0	Um, okay. This is goin' ta sound a little strange. Um, but, stick with me. Um, moooommm? Would you mind coming with me to sign up for the Special Olympics so I can beat all the handicapped kids and win a thousand dollars?	[]
Liane	13	0	Oh... N- no, sweetie. I believe those Olympics are just for... special children.	[]
Cartman	12	0	I'm not special? I thought you always said I was special.	[]
Liane	14	0	You are, hon, but... I don't think that's a very good idea.	[]
Cartman	7	0	...I'll split the money with you.	[]
Liane	8	0	...I'm sorry, Eric. The answer is No.	[]
Cartman	99	1	All right, Mom, look. Here's .. the truth.  God, this is gonna be hard to say.  I think, Mom, that I've been hard on some of the handicapped kids at school in the past. I've sometimes looked at people with disabilities as people God put here on earth for my amusement, but... now I'm starting to think... that if I could just spend one day in their shoes... if I could just see the challenges they face every day... maybe I wouldn't be so cold. I just want a chance to change.  Help me change?	['amusement']
Liane	12	0	Oh, a- a- all right, sweetie, I- I'll take you tomorrow.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Awesome.	[]
Jimmy	16	0	You did a great job in the 500, Timmy. You're really im-p-p-proving.	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmih!	[]
Jimmy	45	0	I think I really got a shot at the gold in the swimming competition. Coach says I'm the fastest he's ever seen. Well, I'll see you nice and early for p-practice, Tim-Tim. Oh, uh, can you hand me my bag?	[]
Timmy	3	0	Timmih!  Tim- Timmy?	[]
Jimmy	29	0	Oh, uh, so... hey, Timmy... uh hu-how about we go out for a s-s-soda later?  I'll uh, I-I'll see you later, Tim-Tim.	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmih...	[]
Jimmy	12	0	Look it's really none of your b-b-b-beeswax, Timmy!	[]
Timmy	2	0	Timmih. Timmih!	[]
Jimmy	15	0	Because I, maybe I don't have what it takes to win with-without them!	[]
Timmy	4	0	Timmih.  T-T-Timmih.	[]
Jimmy	9	0	You you aren't gonna... tell anybody, are you?	[]
Timmy	4	0	Huh! Timmih! T-Timmih!	[]
Jimmy	16	0	Look, it's my b-body and it's my choice what I put in it!	[]
Timmy	6	0	Timmih! Timmih, Jimmih!  Arrrh Timmih!  Jimmih!	[]
Jimmy	37	0	Don't lecture me on the complexities of sportsmanship. You know as well as I do most of the kids in Special Olympics aren't shooting up to compete. I'm just trying to k-keep up.	[]
Timmy	3	0	Huh... Timmih...  Timmih.	[]
Jimmy	44	2	S-s-s-so what are you gonna do now, huh?! You gonna be a fuckin' narc and show that b-bottle to the... coaches?!  Don't think you're any better than me, Timmy! I'm just living in the real world!  Fuck!	['fuckin', 'fuck']
Timmy	4	0	Timmih!  Aaar-yaaaaah Timmih!	[]
Coach	8	0	All right, thirty yards, Timmy! Keep it up!	[]
Timmy	3	0	Oowrrr! Timmih! Livilaye!	[]
Jimmy	3	0	Y-yeess! Grrrr!	[]
Coach 2	23	0	Wuh-wow, Jimmy, I can't believe how much you've improved! You're bigger and stronger than I've ever seen you!	[]
Jimmy	9	0	Yeah, I've been working out... r-really hard.	[]
Coach 2	14	0	You keep going like this and you'll break Special Olympics records on Saturday!	[]
Man	13	0	Okay, so this is all the stuff we need to sign Michael in?	[]
Volunteer	19	0	Yup. Just take the sign-up sheet down to the next table and we'll get it all finalized.	[]
Woman	4	0	Thank you very much.	[]
Volunteer	5	0	Thank you! Good luck, Michael.	[]
Michael	1	0	Thanks.	[]

Liane	11	0	Hello. Um, I would like to... sign my son up, please.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Naaaa!	[]

Liane	2	0	Eric Cartman...	[]
Cartman	2	0	Caaartmaaan! Daaaaa!	[]
Volunteer	2	0	Okay. Age?	[]
Liane	3	0	He's nine.	[]
Volunteer	7	0	O-kay, and what's his disability?	[]
Liane	4	1	...Um, he's retarded.	['retarded']
Volunteer	15	0	...N-no, I'm asking what his specific condition is. Down's Syndrome? Cerebral palsy?	[]
Liane	11	0	Ohhh, oh. I'm not sure.  Sweetie, what is your condition?	[]
Cartman	8	1	...How should I know? I'm retarded. Daaaaa!	['retarded']
Volunteer	8	0	I'll just leave that blank for now.	[]
Jimmy	4	0	Yeah, b-bigger, stronger!	[]
Mr. Mackey	20	0	Oh, hi Timmy. Come on in.  I understand you have somethin' important you wanna talk to me about, m'kay?	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmy.	[]
Mr. Mackey	32	0	Well, Timmy, as your counselor, I want you to know that you can tell me anything, m'kay? And whatever's troublin' you, I wanna try and, and help you with it.	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmy.	[]
Mr. Mackey	11	0	Mmm'kay, right, you're Timmy. ...Yo-you have a problem?	[]
Timmy	3	0	No Timmy, Jimmy.	[]
Mr. Mackey	2	0	Ji-Jimmy?	[]
Timmy	4	0	Haaa!  Oh, oh!  Jimmy.	[]
Mr. Mackey	8	0	Oh, Jimmy Valmer! Oh, okay, what about him?	[]
Timmy	24	0	Timmih! Timmih, uh, Jimmih.  Hey Timmy, Timmih Tim-oh! Tim-Timmih!  Timmmih? Jimmih! Jimmih.  Jimmih Timmih Timmih? Timmih, Timmih! Jimmih... Jimmih! Jimmih! Timmih!  Timmih!	[]

Mr. Mackey	5	0	Right. He's Jimmy, yeah.	[]
Timmy	1	0	Haaaaaaaaaah!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Enter.	[]
Kyle	23	0	Cartman, I really, really have a problem with what you're doing. I object to it morally, and I find it grossly offensive.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Go on, Kyle.	[]
Kyle	61	1	I know that I often have serious moral objections to the things that you do, but... this time I think you really need to reconsider, because if you do this, I believe you will go to hell. So I feel it is my responsibility, as your friend, to tell people what you're doing, and to put a stop to it!	['hell']
Cartman	48	1	Well, Kyle, I understand where you're coming from, and I appreciate you being so direct. Um, the thing is, you really have kind a warped view on morality because you're Jewish. Now, Kyle, you haven't gone to see Mel Gibson's film, The Passion but-	['jewish']
Kyle	11	0	I didn't come here to talk about The Passion, Cartman!	[]
Cartman	41	2	Let me finish. If you had seen The Passion you would know that Hell is reserved for the Jews, and all those who don't accept Christ. That being the case, it is actually me who is worried about your soul.	['hell', 'jews']
Kyle	7	0	I came here to talk about you!	[]
Cartman	25	0	Yes.  And instead you had to break through yourself. This is really the beginning of a whole new chapter of your life, Kyle.  Good luck.	[]
Jimmy	13	0	Come on, push it! Push it!  Yeah. Nice p-pecs. Sweet b-biceps.	[]
Nancy	10	0	Jimmy, I thought we were meeting at the doughnut shop.	[]
Jimmy	15	0	The Games are in two days, Nancy. I can't be w-wasting my time.	[]
Nancy	12	0	I guess I didn't realize I was a waste of time.	[]
Jimmy	15	0	Oh Jesus!  You gonna start running your mouth off again?  P-push it! Push it!	[]
Nancy	9	0	Jimmy, everyone's worried about you. You seem... different.	[]
Jimmy	6	0	Theh-they're all just... jealous.	[]
Nancy	19	0	You're not the boy I fell in love with last week during Free Period. I'm leaving you.	[]
Jimmy	16	1	You're not leaving me! You try to leave me and I'll kill you, bitch!	['bitch']
Nancy	7	0	You can't treat people like this!	[]
Jimmy	38	2	I said, shut your mouth, bitch! Why did you make me do it, huh?!  You're not leavin' anybody! You just keep your G-Goddamned mouth shut and do what you're t-t-t-uh-tol-told!  '	['bitch', 'goddamned']
Sarah Valmer	6	0	What the?  Jimmy, oh my God!	[]
Jimmy	12	1	Stay away from me, you stupid b-b-b-bitches!  No! God!  '	['bitches']

Winner	2	0	All right!	[]
Blond Boy	2	0	Good Job.	[]
Blonde Girl	3	0	We did it!	[]
Cartman	16	1	Well, guess I'll, guess I'll just have to kick ass in the other events.	['ass']
Jimmy	3	0	Yeeessss!  Yes! Yes!	[]
Announcer	12	0	He's got it! That's a new Special Olympics record, folks!	[]
Cartman	2	1	God-damnit!	['damnit']
Announcer	3	0	Winner, Jimmy Valmer!	[]
Cartman	16	2	All right, this one I can win!  Here, hold this!  I'll show you Goddamned retards!	['goddamned', 'retards']

Bonds	7	0	The 2004 special athlete is... Jimmy Valmer.	[]
Jimmy	13	1	Yeah! Fuck yeah!  Yeah, I did it! I'm the b-bub-best!  '	['fuck']
Host	36	0	Congratulations, Jimmy. But we all know that the Special Olympics isn't just about winning. And so, we will now give out the Spirit Award, to the handicapped person who came in very last. Eric Cartman!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Ah, screw you hippies!	[]
Host	21	0	For winning the Spirit Award, Eric will receive this gift certificate to Shakey's for fifty dollars! Come on up, Eric!	[]
Cartman	10	0	...I could pile at Shakey's, heck.  Uh, Drrrr! Drrrr!	[]
Jimmy	12	1	Hey! Just what the hell do you think you're doing, Eric?! '	['hell']
Cartman	5	0	Uhh, hehe. Uh de-duhhhh. '	[]
Jimmy	24	1	You f-f f-faked being handicapped to win?!  I should k- ick your ass right here, you lousy no-good ch-ch-cheater!	['ass']
Timmy	1	0	Timmih! '	[]
Jimmy	1	0	What?	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmih! '	[]
Jimmy	212	6	Oh my God. You-you're right, Timmy. You're totally right.  Everyone, can I have your attention, please?  I'm afraid I have to give back my medal. The truth is, I haven't been playing fair either. I've been using st-steroids. I was willing to do anything to be the best, and the steroids made me blind to the people I was hurting.  A good friend even tried to talk me out of it, and I wouldn't listen to him.  Taking steroids is just like pretending to be handicapped at the Special Olympics.  Because you're taking all the fairness out of the game. But I know now that even if you do win on steroids, you're really not a winner. You're just a p-pussy. You're just a  big fat p-p-pussy, and if you take steroids, the only decent thing to do is come forward and say,  Remove me from the record books, because I am a big, stinky p-pussy-   -steroid-taking jackass.  That's how I feel about myself, and why I must decline this medal and my place in the history books. And if you'll let me, I'll be back next year. To compete with honor.  '	['pussy', 'fat', 'pussy', 'stinky', 'pussy', 'jackass']
McGuire	8	0	Hey kid. Good for you for being honest.	[]
Cartman	48	1	Well guys, I guess now you see what I was up to all along. I dressed up like a handicapped person and lost the Special Olympics on purpose, so that Jimmy could learn his lesson about steroids.  Eh, oh yeah?! We- well you guys are assholes!  Grow up!	['assholes']
