Barbrady	1	0	Right.	[]
Mayor	57	1	Okay. Let's quiet down, people and jakovasaurs!  Now, as you know, the winner of this little game will get an all-expense paid trip for himself and fifty of his closest relatives to lovely France!  And, all one of you lucky constetants has to do is answer only one of these questions! Are you ready, players?	['jakovasaurs']
Barbrady	1	0	Ready.	[]
Jakov	1	0	Ready.	[]
Mayor	5	0	Okay. Hands on your buzzers.	[]

Mayor	1	0	What?	[]
Barbrady	4	0	Uh. Blue is blue?	[]
Jakov	4	0	Awww, did I lose?	[]
Mayor	13	0	What? Blue is-? Nono. Hang on.  You're supposed to lose, you idiot!	[]
Barbrady	3	0	Where am I?	[]
Mayor	9	0	Just don't answer any more questions, got it?	[]
Barbrady	2	0	Okie-dokie.	[]
Mayor	13	0	Sorry, folks, a little mix-up. We're playing best out of three!	[]
Cartman	17	0	What are we doing out here, you guys? I wanna see if Jakov wins that game show.	[]
Stan	7	0	Oh, he'll win. Don't worry.	[]
Kyle	26	0	We just have to show you this new species because you're the Department of Interior guy now. Soon, they'll all be eaten by bears.	[]
Cartman	24	0	Oh. Let me get out my notepad so I can classify this new species.  Well, this should be fine, just fine. Just fine, fine.	[]
Kyle	10	0	There it is!  That must be of the antelope family.	[]
Cartman	19	0	That's Kenny with branches on his head.  Why did you bring me all the out here, you guys?	[]
Stan	12	1	Cartman, jakovasaurs are making South Park suck. You have to understand that.	['jakovasaurs']

Cartman	2	0	Come... back.	[]
Liane	8	0	Eric, it's important for you to understand-.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Don't, mother! Just, don't.	[]
Mayor	27	0	I know it's hard, Eric, but I've learned something today. You see, animal species come and go. It's all a part of natural evolution.	[]
Jimbo	21	1	The jakovasaurs would have gone extinct if we hadn't interfered. Because their particular form of life simply wasn't practical.	['jakovasaurs']
Ned	26	0	We can't go around saving every form of life, any more than we can kill them all. We have to let nature run its course.	[]
Jimbo	6	0	Mhmm Ned, that voice box sucks!	[]
Ned	11	0	I know. I'm still trying to find my old one.	[]
Mayor	11	0	Well, then. What say we all go get some ice cream!	[]

Waiter	1	0	Bonjour.	[]
