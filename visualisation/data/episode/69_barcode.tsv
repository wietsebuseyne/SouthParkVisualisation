But... years from now, when you're old and have children of your own, what would you give to come back and fight this one day? This one day, when you could have made a difference!

Cartman	14	1	No, I'm trying to teach it how to bite someone's penis off.	['penis']
Jimbo	18	0	Oh. Well, does Mr. Denkins know you're usin' his pony? He shoots trespassers on sight, you know.	[]
Cartman	5	0	He said it was okay.	[]
Jimbo	17	2	Alright, then.  Wait, why the hell are you trainin' Denkins' pony to bite off someone's penis?	['hell', 'penis']

Cartman	5	0	How do I do that?	[]
Jimbo	4	0	What do you see?	[]
Cartman	20	2	I see Scott Tenorman. With his ginger red hair and his stupid freckles and his- Goddmnit goddamnit I hate him!!!	['ginger', 'goddamnit']

Jimbo	5	0	Oo what's a Radiohead?	[]

Ned	6	0	Mmuh what am I doing here?	[]
Jimbo	7	0	Oh, Jesus, don't start singing, Ned!	[]
Cartman	23	0	So, the subject is a big Radiohead fan, huh? Maybe I should come up with a  li'l ol' scheme  that involves them.	[]
Jimbo	4	0	Nice thinking, young hunter.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Whoa!	[]
Jimbo	1	0	What?	[]
Cartman	18	0	I'm looking in Scott's parents' room. Scott's mom's about to take off her bra.	[]

Jimbo	2	1	Oh crap!	['crap']
Mr. Tenorman	4	0	Who's out there?	[]
Jimbo	7	0	Ned, for Christ's sake, stop jackin'!	[]
Ned	3	0	I can't.	[]
Mr. Tenorman	19	0	Don't think I don't see you! I know who you are and I'm calling the police!	[]
A man	7	0	Whoa, I gotta get out of here!	[]
Cartman	20	0	Oh, hey, Scott. How's it goin'? I was just wondering, do you like the band, uh, Radiohead at all?	[]
Scott	2	0	Uh huh.	[]
Cartman	28	0	Oh, really? Oh, 'cause, they're doin' a big interview on MTV, and they're playing it tonight on a big screen downtown.  Everyone's gonna be there!	[]
Scott	7	0	Oh, cool. Um, thanks for tellin' me.	[]
Cartman	4	0	You're welcome, Scott.	[]
Cartman	15	0	Okay. Well, it looks like everyone is here. Let's play the video, shall we?	[]
Kurt Loder	29	0	Welcome back to MTV. We're here with the members from Radiohead, probably the hottest band in the world right now.  Guys, when is the next album coming out?	[]
Cartman	44	0	That's an interesting question, Kurt. But first I'd just like to say that I really hate this kid named Scott Tenorman. He's stupid.  Yeah, I hate Scott Tenorman too.  I think all the guys in the band hate him, right guys?	[]
Cartman	7	0	Oh, Jesus, did you hear that, Scott?	[]
Kurt Loder	7	0	And will there be a new tour?	[]
Cartman	31	0	Well, we would tour, but we just hate that Scott Tenorman kid so much that we don't want to.  Yeah. Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! He's not cool!	[]
Cartman	53	1	Wow, that really sucks for you, Scott.  Scott? Ha haha ha ha ha! Did you see that? Scott mast have ran home so embarrassed! Ha ha ha ha. And you know what? That wasn't really Radiohead talking! I just dubbed their voices over! HAHAHAHA!  What a retard!  And now everyone saw it!	['retard']
Scott	14	1	Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, it's time for the amazing Pube Boy!	['pube']
Cartman	15	0	'I'm a little piggy; here's my snout. Oink oink oink, oink oink oink.'	[]
Stan	6	0	Oh my God, he killed Kenny.	[]
Cartman	13	0	That does it! I'm gonna get Scott Tenorman once and for all!!!	[]
Cartman	44	0	Hueah. You think you're so cool, Scott Tenorman? We'll see how cool you feel after this-uh! Yes. Yes! Yes!!  Then... that...  Hahaha, hahahaha! Yes! It is the most genius plan ever!! Scott Tenorman is going to wish he never met meee!!!	[]
Kyle	6	0	Okay, Cartman, what do you want?	[]
Cartman	11	0	Stan, Kyle, thanks for coming. I have it all figured out!	[]
Stan	5	0	Got what all figured out?	[]
Cartman	6	0	How to get Scott Tenorman back!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Oh, Jesus!	[]
Cartman	31	0	I just finished planning a brilliant  li'l scheme  that should put Scott in his place for good! And if you help me, I'll give each of you... two... dollars.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Okay, so what's the plan?	[]
Cartman	18	0	It's the brilliant combination of my last two plans. Scott Tenorman's favorite band is Radiohead, right?	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Cartman	32	1	So, I realized, 'What if we got Radiohead to come here to South Park?' right? Then they could meet Scott Tenorman - and - see him get his wiener bitten off by a pony!	['wiener']
Kyle	1	0	...What?	[]
Cartman	64	1	Don't you see? If I can get this pony to bite off Scott's wiener in front of Radiohead, then Scott would cry. And if Scott cries, then Radiohead will say Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! And that would make Scott Tenorman wanna die!!  Okay, I'll keep working on the pony, you guys go get Radiohead to play here! Ready? Break!!	['wiener']
Kyle	6	1	You're such a dumbass, Cartman.	['dumbass']
Cartman	15	0	...Fine, I'll do it myself!! You guys just watch!!  Ready, pony?  Bite it!  Yes!!	[]
Johnny	12	0	Thom, will you stop reading fan mail? We have work to do.	[]
Thom	102	1	Just a second, fellas. Listen to this: Dear Radiohead, My name is Eric Cartman. I'm a young, supple eight-year-old boy from South Park, Colorado. I am writing to you because of a kid I know named Scott Tenorman. Scott is fifteen, and I'm afraid he has cancer. In his ass. Radiohead is his favorite band, and it would make his short life if you could find it in your hearts to visit him before he dies alone and scared. Won't you please consider it? I don't think he'll make it past... next Tuesday around 5.	['ass']
Phil	5	0	Wow, we have to go.	[]

Cartman	11	0	Likewise. Well, come on, you've got to see the pony!	[]
Scott	11	0	Just a second: don't you- wanna taste my chili first?	[]
Cartman	22	0	Well, e-yeah, but, there's a special guest coming, and I want you to be near the pony when they arrive.	[]
Scott	16	0	Well I don't want it to get cold. I think I can win first prize.	[]
Cartman	19	1	Alright, Scott, uh. Let's go over to the judging table and we'll try the chili first.  Goddamnit!	['goddamnit']
Scott	11	0	Alright, I guess we should taste each other's chili, huh?	[]
Cartman	10	0	Huh, this chili looks pretty good. Weh, here's mine.	[]
Scott	20	0	Mmm. Ah, I don't know. Your chili is pretty good, Cartman, but I think mine is better. Try it.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Alright.  Hey, this is great!	[]
Scott	6	0	Eh, it's a special recipe.	[]
Cartman	6	0	Gawh, this is really good, Scott!	[]
Scott	22	0	I'm glad you like it so much, because now that you're almost finished, I have some'in' to tell you.	[]
Cartman	11	0	What? You mean about how you put pubes in your chili?	[]
Scott	1	0	What?!	[]
Cartman	156	2	Yehes, I'm afraid this isn't your chili, Scott. I switched it with Chef's.  It's delicious, Chef. I hadn't planned on that. What I did plan on, however, was that my friends, Stan and Kyle, would betray me and warn you that the Chili Con Carnival was a trap.  I assumed that they would tell you that I had trained Denkins' pony to bite off your wiener. What they didn't tell you was that Denkins is a crazy redneck who shoots trespassers on sight. Knowing that you would try and do something to the pony, I warned Mr. Denkins that violent pony killers were in the area.  I also know that you wouldn't go yourself, for fear of having your wiener bitten off. You would most likely send your parents.  And, I'm afraid that when Mr. Denkins spotted them on his property, he shot and killed both your parents.	['wiener', 'wiener']
Mr. Denkins	14	0	Well, they was trespassin' and I was protectin' myself. I, I have my rights.	[]
Scott	6	0	My... mom and dad are... dead?	[]
Cartman	73	0	I came just in time to see Mr. Denkins giving his report to Officer Barbrady. And of course, to steal the bodies...  After a night with the hacksaw, I was all ready to put on my Chili Con Carnival, so that I could tell you personally about your parents' demise! And of course, feed you your chili.  Do you like it? Do you like it, Scott?  I call it, Mr. & Mrs. Tenorman Chili.	[]
Scott	6	0	Oh my God!  Oh my God!!	[]
Cartman	12	0	Nyahnyahnyahnyah nyah nyah! I made you eat your parents! Nyahnyahnyahnyah nyah nyah!	[]
Stan	3	0	Jesus Christ, dude!	[]
Scott	8	0	My mom and dad are dead!  No! NOOO!!	[]
Thom	3	0	Uhm, excuse me?	[]
Stan	3	0	Who are you?	[]
Johnny	5	0	We're that band, Radiohead.	[]
Scott	1	0	Jesus!	[]
Ed	6	0	Jeez, what a li'l crybaby!	[]
Colin	7	0	Are you gonna cry all day, crybaby??	[]
Thom	18	0	You know, everyone has problems; it doesn't mean you have to be a little crybaby about it.	[]
Ed	12	0	Come om, guys, let's go. This kid is totally not cool.	[]
Thom	11	0	Yeah, that's the most uncool kid I've ever met.	[]
Phil	2	0	Little crybaby!	[]
Scott	10	0	No, wait! Waaiittt!! Oh my God, Oh my Gaawwwd!!  Noooo!	[]
Cartman	17	0	Yes! Yesss!! Oh, let me taste your tears, Scott!  Mm, your tears are so yummy and sweet.	[]
Kyle	15	0	Dude, I think it might be best for us to never piss Cartman off again.	[]
Stan	2	0	Good call.	[]
Cartman	17	0	Oh, the tears of unfathomable sadness! My-yummy.  Mm-yummy you guys!  Yuppitibut, that's all, folks!	[]
