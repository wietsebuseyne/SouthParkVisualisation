Liane	3	0	Oh, hello boys.	[]
Stan	16	0	Hi. Uh, the school called and said we all have to start going to class again.	[]
Liane	7	0	Oh, but I thought your teacher died.	[]
Kyle	20	1	She did, but now they're saying we have to start going back to school anyways. It's totally gay.	['gay']

Tweek	6	0	Cartman likes to play with dolls?	[]
Cartman	16	0	Hello, Precious. Yes, that's a good Precious.  Now it takes the lotion from the basket.	[]
Polly Prissy Pants	9	0	Oh please, mister. Please let me out of here.	[]
Cartman	14	0	It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.	[]
Poodle	4	0	Bark bark bark bark!	[]

Polly Prissy Pants	5	0	Please, mister, let me out.	[]

Polly Prissy Pants	10	0	I miss my Mom, mister. I wanna see my Mommy-	[]
Cartman	7	1	Put the lotion in the fuckin' basket!	['fuckin']
Liane	1	0	Sweetie.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Yes Mom?	[]
Liane	7	0	You have to get ready for school	[]
Cartman	6	0	...No, our teacher's dead. Remember?	[]
Liane	14	0	Yes, but they said two weeks off was enough, and they want everyone back.	[]
Cartman	20	0	Two weeks isn't enough. I'm not over our teacher's tragic death. I'm still sh-shooken up.	[]
Liane	6	0	You'll get over it, honey.	[]
Cartman	4	0	But I wanna plaaayyy.	[]
Wendy	20	0	I can't believe it's been two weeks since I've seen you guys. What have you been doing?	[]
Bebe	2	0	Hey guys.	[]
Wendy	2	0	Hey Bebe.	[]
Bebe	6	0	You guys uh,  notice anything different?	[]
Wendy	7	1	Oh my God, Bebe. You got boobs.	['boobs']
Bebe	23	0	Yeah, they started coming in last week. At first I thought they were just mosquito bites, but, then they didn't go away.	[]
Mr. Mackey	45	0	M'kay kids, let's take our seats, m'kay?  I know this has been a difficult couple o'weeks for you all with the untimely death of your teacher, but it's time for us to try to move on and learn, m'kay?	[]
Cartman	31	0	Mr. Mackey, I don't think I'm over the teacher's tragic death yet. I need more time. It's just... it still hurts, you know? Can I go home?	[]
Mr. Mackey	40	0	No. Eric, what we're gonna do is learn to hide our emotions with math problems.  M'kay, so let's start with some multiplication tables over here, m'kay. First we'll do uh, four time four, m'kay?	[]
Kyle	9	0	Dude, look at Bebe.  Something seems different about her.	[]
Stan	12	0	Yeah, I noticed that too. Did she get a haircut or something?	[]
Kyle	4	0	I don't know.	[]
Clyde	15	0	Hey Token. You know, I never noticed before, but that girl Bebe is... kinda cool.	[]
Token	23	0	I was just thinking the same thing. It's like, she's a girl, but, she's someone you could hang out with.	[]
Butters	6	0	Yeah. Bebe is kinda cool, huh?	[]
Cartman	13	0	Hey Craig, is that the same shirt that that Bebe chick always wears?	[]
Craig	5	0	I don't know. Why?	[]
Cartman	10	0	It just... it just seems like a really awesome shirt.	[]
Craig	4	0	Yeah. It kinda does.	[]
Mr. Mackey	20	0	Okay, and so uh,  so who can tell me the answer to the first problem, six times eight? Uh, Bebe?	[]
Bebe	4	0	Oh, uh, forty-eight?	[]
All the boys	1	0	Whoa.	[]
Clyde	5	0	That is an awesome answer!	[]
All the boys	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Kyle	5	0	Dude! Bebe is really smart!	[]
Stan	17	0	Yeah. I never noticed that before. Maybe she's actually cool enough to hang out with us.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Yeah, may be.	[]
Wendy	13	0	...And I was like, I'm not buying those shoes for twenty dollars.	[]
Stan	3	0	Ah, hey, Bebe.	[]
Bebe	1	0	Yeah?	[]
Stan	20	0	Uh, we're gonna throw rocks at cars later on, and we thought maybe you'd like to join us.	[]
Bebe	7	0	Really?  I've never done that before.	[]
Butters	21	0	Wuuhh, it's really fun.You toss these little rocks at cars, and if the driver gets angry, you blame me.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Yeah, it's cool.	[]
Bebe	5	0	Why sure, that sounds hellafun.	[]
The boys	1	0	Hahahahahaha...	[]
Kyle	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Stan	1	0	Hellafun	[]
Cartman	2	0	Right, heh.	[]
Clyde	5	0	Wow, hellafun. That's awesome.	[]
Token	7	0	I'm gonna start saying that now.	[]
Stan	7	0	Cool.  We'll see you later, Bebe.	[]
Wendy	14	0	Stan, you've never asked me to throw rocks at cars with you guys.	[]
Stan	20	0	That's different, dude. You're like, my girlfriend. Bebe's just... I don't know. She's just cool.	[]
Kyle	5	0	Yeah. She's really cool.	[]
Clyde	8	0	It's weird how we never noticed before.	[]
Stan	30	0	So what you do, see, is wait for a car to drive by that big pine tree. Then you chuck a rock at it. It's all about the timing.	[]
Driver	3	1	You damn kids!	['damn']
Bebe	1	0	Cool.	[]
Clyde	4	0	You try it, Bebe.	[]
Bebe	1	0	Okay.	[]
Token	4	0	Here comes a sedan.	[]
Driver	3	1	You damn kids!	['damn']
The boys	1	0	Awesome!	[]
Butters	11	0	Cool!  That was the most perfect throw I've ever seen.	[]
Kyle	14	0	That was sweet, Bebe.  Now, if you just hold the rock like this, you-	[]
Clyde	13	0	Yeah.  Here, it's like if you put your thumb on this side-	[]
Kyle	4	0	I'm showing her.	[]
Clyde	14	0	Yeah, just let me show her real quick how to put the thumb and-	[]
Kyle	1	0	Hoh!	[]
Clyde	3	0	Hoh hoh hoh!	[]
Kyle	13	0	Hoh!  Anyways, you put a spin on it by holding it here and-	[]
Stan	11	0	Yeah, and then you can actually hold it like this. Now-	[]
Kyle	5	0	Hoh! Hoh hoh hoh hoh!	[]
Stan	3	0	Hoh hoh hoh!	[]
Kyle	3	0	Hah hah hah!	[]
Craig	3	0	Urh urh urh!	[]
Bebe	20	0	Uh. Listen guys, uh, It's five-thirty. I'm supposed to get home, so... I'll see you later.	[]
Stan	6	0	...Wait, what were we doing again?	[]
Kyle	6	0	We were throwing rocks at cars.	[]
The boys	2	0	Oh yeah.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Woohoo.	[]
Butters	5	0	Uh here comes an SUV.	[]
Jimbo	3	1	You damn kids!	['damn']
The boys	2	0	Hi, Bebe.	[]
Bebe	2	0	Hey everybody.	[]
Wendy	5	0	Oh, for Christ's sake!	[]
Mr. Mackey	24	0	M'kay. Kids, I asked you to write a paper to read aloud for the class. Now, who want to start?  M'kay, class.	[]
Clyde	11	0	My paper is called, Why Bebe is the coolest person, ever.	[]
Stan	7	0	Hey, that's what I wrote about!	[]
Butters	2	0	Me too!	[]
Clyde	1	0	Hoh!	[]
Stan	8	0	Hah hah, hah!  Uuuuh-okay. Go ahead, Clyde.	[]
Clyde	29	0	My friend Bebe is really smart. She tells funny jokes and knows a lot about stuff. She's good at almost everything she tries. She's awesome. The end.	[]
Mr. Mackey	14	0	M'kay, very nice, Clyde. Uh, Token, why don't you read your paper?	[]
Token	31	0	If I could be Bebe.  If I was Bebe I would have lots of friends because I would be sooo great. I would make people smile and think wherever I went.	[]
Mr. Mackey	24	0	M'kay, interesting, Token, Uh... Who would like to go next?  Uh how about someone who didn't write about how cool Bebe is?	[]
The boys	1	0	Oh.	[]
Mr. Mackey	3	0	M'kay, Bebe?	[]
Bebe	3	0	My cat Thumper.	[]
The boys	1	0	Wwooww.	[]
Bebe	14	0	Thumper is gray with a white spot. Sometimes he likes to chase his tail.	[]
Clyde	8	0	Chase his tail? That must be so funny?	[]
Bebe	14	0	Thumper is twelve years old. That's pretty old for a cat. The end.	[]
The boys	1	0	Wwooww!	[]
Cartman	24	0	God, you know what, that's so true? Because, you sometimes never really think about how old a pet is until it's gone.	[]
Craig	13	0	That's true, huh? Man, that makes me really reflect on my pet.	[]
Stan	6	0	That's such a great paper!	[]
Mr. Mackey	10	0	M'kay. Wendy, why don't we hear your paper?	[]
Wendy	4	0	The new Cold War	[]
Cartman	8	0	Oh God! Here we go again! Dork alert!	[]
Wendy	15	0	But, then the mall closes at four or five o'clock, so who knows w-	[]
Clyde	9	0	Have any of you dumb girls seen Bebe anywhere?	[]
Wendy	1	0	No!	[]
Kyle	7	0	Maybe she's in the lunch line.	[]
The boys	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Wendy	14	0	Can you believe Bebe? She thinks she's so cool all of a sudden.	[]
Millie	11	1	I can't stand her anymore! She's such a slut!	['slut']
Esther	5	1	She's a total slut!	['slut']
Red	18	0	You know what I heard? I heard that she made out with eight different boys in one minute.	[]
Millie	14	0	I heard that she lifted her shirt to the boys at the bus stop.	[]
Wendy	9	1	I heard that her asshole is this big around.	['asshole']
Bebe	2	0	Hey guys.	[]
Wendy	5	2	Oh, hey Bebe.  Slut.  Slut.	['slut', 'slut']
Millie	1	1	Slut.	['slut']
Esther	1	1	Slut.	['slut']
Millie	1	1	Slut.	['slut']
Bebe	9	0	...You guys still wanna go ice-skating after school?	[]
Wendy	28	3	Oh, no, that's okay Bebe. You might trip and then we'd be sucked into your huge gaping vagina like ants into a vacuum cleaner.  Slut.  Slut.	['vagina', 'slut', 'slut']
Millie	1	1	Slut.	['slut']
Esther	1	1	Slut.	['slut']
Red	1	1	Slut.	['slut']
Wendy	1	1	Slut.	['slut']
Millie	1	1	Slut.	['slut']
Girls	3	3	Whore. Slut. Slut.	['whore', 'slut', 'slut']
Bebe's Mom	5	0	Bebe, is something the matter?	[]
Bebe	27	2	Oh Mom, it's just... My girlfriends at school said some really mean things to me today.  They called me a slut, with a huge gaping vagina.	['slut', 'vagina']
Bebe's Mom	26	1	Oh, sweetie. You're all just growing up.  Part of being a woman is having a friend one day and calling her a slut the next.	['slut']
Bebe	28	1	But am I slutty just because I'm beginning to be friends with guys? I mean, they just like me because they think I'm smart and cool.	['slutty']
Bebe	40	0	I remember when I was a little girl the boys didn't think I was very smart at all. But then one day, they all started thinking I was really smart. I guess big smarts just run in our family.	[]
Bebe	18	0	Well if the girls don't wanna be my friend, that's fine!  Guys are way cooler, anyways.	[]
Tweek	8	0	You... guys wanted me to meet you here?	[]
Cartman	12	0	Yeah, have a seat, Tweek. We all need to have a talk	[]
Tweek	2	0	Oh God.	[]
Cartman	35	0	Alright guys, now that we're all here, I think... we need to have a difficult conversation. It's obvious that Bebe is the like the coolest, smartest, most awesome person we've ever met.	[]
"Stan, Kyle"	1	0	True.	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Yep.	[]
Cartman	31	0	And, you know, we've been trying to fill the gap for the fourth friend ever since Kenny died, God rest his soul, and it hasn't been an easy process.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Right.	[]
Stan	2	0	Uh huh.	[]
Cartman	36	0	And so, even though I think it's a tough thing to do right now, I think maybe it's best for everyone if we make room to allow Bebe to be our new fourth friend.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Stan	4	0	That would be best.	[]
Cartman	27	0	Well, I'm glad you guys all agree. And so, Kyle, I just wanna say that it's been really great, and we're gonna miss you.	[]
Kyle	1	0	Huh??	[]
Stan	1	0	Kyle??	[]
Cartman	31	0	And even though it didn't quite work out, I'm sure you'll find other friends down the road, Kyle. Here's a nice watch for you, and some peanuts.	[]
Kyle	9	0	Me?? Dude, I've been here since the beginning!	[]
Cartman	22	0	And we're really sad to see you go. Let's give a big round of applause for Kyle, everybody. Hip hip.	[]
Stan	7	0	Dude, we're not kicking Kyle out!	[]
Cartman	1	0	Pleeeeease???	[]
Stan	1	0	No!	[]
Cartman	34	0	Alright, fine! Well then, I guess we have no choice but to let you go, Tweek. But we want you to know that its been really fun. Here's a watch, and some peanuts.	[]
Kyle	5	0	No way! Tweek's cool!	[]
Stan	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Cartman	10	1	Well dumbasses, how are we gonna make room for Bebe!?	['dumbasses']
Bebe	13	0	Thanks for inviting me to ride the bus to school with you guys.	[]
Stan	3	0	Sure thing, Bebe.	[]
Cartman	21	3	That's fine! That's fine!! Fuck you, Kyle, and fuck you, Stan!  Fuck you, Tweek!  Bebe, you're still cool.	['fuck', 'fuck', 'fuck']
Wendy	4	0	What are you doing?!	[]
Clyde	11	0	We're tryin' to get Bebe to run for class president.	[]
Wendy	9	0	I'm class president! The vote was last fall!	[]
Craig	18	0	Well, yeah, but Wendy, you have to admit, Bebe's a lot smarter and more organized than you.	[]
Token	14	0	Yeah. We need a leader like Bebe. She can teach us all so much.	[]
The Other Boys	2	0	Uh huh.	[]
Wendy	16	0	She's not smarter and cooler than everyone, you guys are just drawn to something else!	[]
Clyde	1	0	What?	[]
Wendy	7	0	Ugh! God, you guys are sooo stupid!	[]
Butters	3	0	Stupider than Bebe!	[]
Clyde	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Craig	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Butters	7	0	Huh Bebe's cool, huh. Huh, fellas?	[]
Clyde	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Butters	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Craig	2	0	Sure is!	[]
Butters	1	0	Uhyep.	[]
Kyle	10	0	I can't wait to watch Terrance & Phillip with Bebe.	[]
Stan	6	0	Yeah.  Where are you guys going?	[]
Bradley	8	0	We're going to see our friend Bebe.	[]
Stan	11	0	Bebe is our friend. Didn't you all get the memo?	[]
Francis	5	0	Bebe is everybody's friend.	[]
Kevin	11	0	Yeah. God put Bebe on earth to enrich everyone's lives.	[]
Stan	1	0	Hoh!	[]
Kyle	3	0	Hoh hoh hoh!	[]
Kevin	2	0	Arf arf!	[]
Francis	1	0	Arf!	[]
Timmy	6	0	Arf! Ah Timmah! Timmah-ar-argh!	[]
Stan	11	0	Aw alright, I guess we can all watch Terrance & Phillip together.	[]
Bebe's Mom	3	0	Oh, hello, boys.	[]
Stan	3	0	Is Bebe home?	[]
Bebe's Mom	20	0	No, she's with one of her little friends. But she should be back shortly if you boys wanna wait.	[]
Bradley	4	0	Who is she with?	[]
Bebe's Mom	12	0	I believe she is playing Lambs over at Eric Cartman's house.	[]
Stan	2	0	Cartman's?	[]
Cartman	4	0	And this is Precious.	[]
Bebe	1	0	Precious?	[]
Cartman	25	0	Bark bark bark.  Okay, so then we put my mom's hand lotion in this little basket  and lower it down to Polly Prissy Pants.	[]
Bebe	2	0	Uh huh.	[]
Cartman	17	0	Now you say, It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.	[]
Bebe	14	0	It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.	[]
Cartman	2	0	Heheh, yeah.	[]
Polly Prissy Pants	7	0	Mister, please let me out of here.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Now say it again, louder.	[]
Bebe	14	0	It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.	[]
Cartman	10	0	Good. Now, now put the lotion back in the basket!	[]
Polly Prissy Pants	13	0	My parents have money, Mister. They'll give you whatever you want. Please!	[]
Cartman	10	1	Now, just yell Put the lotion in the fucking basket!	['fucking']
Bebe	6	0	Put the lotion in the basket!	[]
Cartman	35	2	Put the lotion in the fucking basket!  Oh no! Precious!  I've got your dog, Mister. Let me out or I'm gonna kill it!  Now you say, Don't you hurt my fuckin' dog!	['fucking', 'fuckin']
Bebe	7	1	Don't you hurt my fucking dog!	['fucking']
Cartman	8	1	You bitch, I'll cut your throat if-	['bitch']
Kyle	6	1	What the hell are you doing?	['hell']
Cartman	4	0	We're playing Lambs.	[]
Kyle	11	0	Bebe, I thought we were going to watch Terrance & Phillip today.	[]
Butters	7	0	Then we gotta work on your campaign.	[]
Francis	8	0	Right, but first we gotta go to the-	[]
Stan	1	0	Hoh!	[]
Bebe	4	0	You guys, calm down!	[]
Timmy	1	0	Timmih!	[]
Bebe	3	0	This is insane!	[]
Bebe	5	0	Stop it you guys, please!	[]
Bebe	10	0	Oh boy, I never meant to cause all this trouble.	[]
Stan	4	0	Hoh, hoh, hohhh! Hohhh!	[]
Bebe's Mom	17	0	Bebe, those boys from your school are still waiting outside to see if you'll come out.	[]
Bebe	8	0	I know. They've been there all day.	[]
Stan	4	0	Hoh, hoh hoh hoh!	[]
Craig	4	0	Hah hah hahah hah!	[]
Stan	5	0	Hoh hoh hoh!  Hohohoh hoh!	[]
Bebe's Mom	11	0	Looks like my little girl has a lot of gentlemen callers.	[]
Bebe	9	0	Mom, why is everyone acting so different around me?	[]
Bebe's Mom	8	0	Sweetie, you're just blossoming into a woman.	[]
Bebe	34	0	But, I, I don't know if I want to. Sometimes I think I'm not as smart and cool as they say, that everyone just tells me I am because of my hooters.	[]
Bebe's Mom	16	0	Sweetie, you're a Stevens. And Stevens women are always told they're really, really smart.	[]
Bebe	6	0	Mom?  What's six times eight?	[]
Mrs. Stevens	30	0	Oho, sweetie, those are two completely different numbers.  Alright boys, time to be getting home. Bebe's not feeling well and she can't come out today. Go one, shoo.	[]
Stan	2	0	Hoh. Hoh?	[]
Astronaut 1	4	0	Aah. We made it.	[]
Astronaut 2	9	0	Boys, can you call 9-1-1 for us?	[]
Astronaut 1	19	0	Oh my God. We've landed on Earth thousands of years in the future and apes have taken over!	[]
Astronaut 2	10	0	I knew it! You blew it up, didn't you?!	[]
Astronaut 1	10	0	I don't want to live in this futuristic madness!	[]
Astronaut 2	8	1	Take your ape rule and go to hell!	['hell']
Bebe	3	1	Having boobs sucks.	['boobs']
A Doctor	17	0	Well hello there, little girl. My name is Dr. Hallis. What can I do for you today?	[]
Bebe	6	0	I wanna have breast-reduction surgery.	[]
Dr. Hallis	1	0	You?	[]
Bebe	14	0	Yes. I have two hundred and twelve dollars in nickels and a gold bracelet.	[]
Dr. Hallis	19	0	Well, young lady, I'm afraid that we don't offer breast reduction surgery to girls of your age.	[]
Bebe	20	0	Why not? Britney Spears got fake ones when she was a teenager. Why can't I have mine taken off?	[]
Dr. Hallis	15	0	Because making breasts larger is a beautiful and wonderful thing. Making them smaller is... insane.	[]
Bebe	9	0	I think it's insane to want them bigger.	[]
Dr. Hallis	7	0	Why do you... hate your breasts so?	[]
Bebe	24	0	Ever since I got these stupid things everyone treats me differently. I feel like I might be treated differently the rest of my life.	[]
Dr. Hallis	8	0	Oh, come on now, that's just silly.	[]
Blonde Nurse	6	0	Here's the Anderson file, Doctor.	[]
Dr. Hallis	17	1	Oh, awesome. Thank you so much, Jillian. That's great. Oh, God-damn. Thanks you so much.	['damn']
Brunette Nurse	8	0	And here's the coffee you wanted, doctor.	[]
Dr. Hallis	10	0	Yeah, whatever. Get out of here.  Now, I was saying?	[]
Bebe	23	0	Please, you have to help me. I think that if my breasts keep growing this way, boys will give me whatever I want.	[]
Dr. Hallis	8	0	Yeah, so? That's great, isn't it?	[]
Bebe	55	0	No it's not, because if I grow up getting everything I want, having things made easy for me because I have hot knockers, then I'm gonna grow up to be a lame person. If I'm handed everything in life, then my chances of becoming a lawyer or a marine biologist are zero.	[]
Dr. Hallis	23	0	That may be true, but I'm afraid I just cannot ethically perform a breast-reduction surgery on an eight-year-old girl.	[]
Bebe	1	1	Damnit!	['damnit']
Dr. Hallis	26	0	If, on the other hand, you'd like to make them a little bigger, I think now might be the right time to size up, hm?	[]
Bebe	3	1	Oh, fuck off!	['fuck']
Sharon	8	0	Randy, could you have a talk with Stanley?	[]
Randy	7	0	Why? What's the matter with him?	[]
Sharon	13	0	It's just that, well, he's been acting a little different lately.	[]
Stan	4	0	Aaaa-ta.  Aaaa-ta.	[]
Sharon	17	0	He's been ignoring his homework, and, all of his friends. I can't figure out why.	[]
Stan	4	0	Aaaa-ta. Aaaa-ta.	[]
Randy	10	0	Ohhh boy. Looks like he's starting to notice breasts.	[]
Sharon	11	0	Oh yes. Our little Stanley is starting to become a man.	[]
Stan	3	0	Ahta. Ah, ahta!	[]
Randy	3	0	Hey there, son.	[]
Stan	3	0	Hoh? Ahta.  Ahta.	[]
Randy	8	0	Yes, ahta. Let's have a talk, Stan.	[]
Stan	1	0	Ahah	[]
Randy	18	1	Stan, as you get older, boobs - bu-these ahta will start becoming a major part of your life.	['boobs']
Stan	1	0	Ahta?	[]
Randy	32	2	But Stanley, you can't let them get in the way of your friends. There are a lot of boobs out there, son. But they're just boobs; your friends... are forever.	['boobs', 'boobs']
Stan	2	0	Friend. Ahta.	[]
Randy	51	6	I know you think this set of boobs is important now, but those boobs will be replaced by another set of boobs. Boobs will come and go, and then, someday,  you'll meet a pair of boobs that you want to marry. And those become the boobs that matter the most.	['boobs', 'boobs', 'boobs', 'boobs', 'boobs', 'boobs']
Sharon	3	0	I love you.	[]
Randy	18	1	If you can just understand that, Stanley, you'll see that boobs hold no real power at all.	['boobs']
Right Breast	10	0	The boys are at war. All is going as planned.	[]
Left Breast	11	0	Yes. Soon all the boys will be brought to their knees.	[]
Right Breast	5	0	We grow larger every day.	[]
Left Breast	2	0	And stronger.	[]
Right Breast	4	0	Soon the entire tow-	[]
Left Breast	5	0	Sh! Sh! She's awake!	[]
Right Breast	2	0	Ah, quiet.	[]
Bebe	2	0	MOM!! MOM!!	[]
Mrs. Stevens	4	0	What is it, Bebe?	[]
Bebe	2	0	My breasts!	[]
Mrs. Stevens	9	0	Oh, sweetheart, you're just becoming a young lady.	[]
Bebe	13	0	No, they're conspiring! Mom, they were talking! They wanna destroy the town!	[]
Mrs. Stevens	36	0	Yes, darling, your breasts have a power that will unleash itself as you get older. They feed off the misery of boys and grow to bring woe wherever they can. You're blossoming into a woman.	[]
Bebe	12	0	That does it! I'm NOT letting these things run my life!	[]
Dr. Hallis	17	0	Young lady, are you absolutely sure you want to consider this kind of procedure for your breasts?	[]
Wendy	7	0	Yes! I want to get breast implants!	[]
Mrs. Testaburger	9	0	I tried to tell her she was too young.	[]
Dr. Hallis	29	0	Well, it is a different time, Mrs. Testaburger. Society puts a lot of pressure on your daughter to look her best. Having small breasts can make her feel unimportant.	[]
Mrs. Testaburger	4	0	But she's eight!	[]
Dr. Hallis	12	0	Yes, well, not too young to feel flat and therefore, not pretty.	[]
Wendy	5	0	That's what I said.	[]
Dr. Hallis	36	0	However, young lady, I'm afraid breast implants are not for everyone.  I'll need to carefully assess your physical and mental condition to see if augmentation is truly the best way for you to go.	[]
Wendy	6	0	I have three thousand dollars, cash.	[]
Dr. Hallis	7	0	You pass. Let's do this thing.	[]
Mrs. Testaburger	9	0	Oh, wait. You're gonna do it right now?	[]
Dr. Hallis	47	0	Suuure. Breast augmentation is now a very simple procedure.  What we do is make a small incision in the armpit where it won't be seen. Then we take this little plastic bag and gently place it in the chest where we fill it with salt water.	[]
Mrs. Testaburger	7	0	I still don't know about this.	[]
Dr. Hallis	28	0	Look. Us plastic surgeons have one philosophy. If we can help someone's self-esteem a little, then why not do it if they have three thousand dollars?	[]
Dr. Hallis	24	2	Cha!  Gotta!  Jam it!  Up there!  Get!  In!  There!  You!  Bitch!  Get!  In!  There!  You!  Bitch!  Hah!  Okay, there's one, Wendy. Doing great.	['bitch', 'bitch']
Mr. Mackey	11	0	M'kay. Kids, we need to talk about your failing grades.	[]
Clyde	5	0	Bebe! Where Bebe?! Bebe! Bebe!	[]
Mr. Mackey	14	0	M'kay, we all need to start studying more and fighting less, m'kay?	[]
Bradley	1	0	Bebe!	[]
Stan	1	0	Ahta!	[]
Bebe	2	0	Hey guys.	[]
Craig	15	0	Have you guys noticed that Bebe isn't as cool as she used to be?	[]
Token	7	1	Yeah. What the hell happened to us?	['hell']
Stan	12	1	Oh my God. I get it now. It was Bebe's boobs.	['boobs']
Cartman	3	1	Bebe's boobs?	['boobs']
Bebe	4	0	Oh cool! It worked!	[]
Stan	17	1	Don't you guys see? Boobs... do something to our brains. They fill our brains with illusions.	['boobs']
Kyle	14	1	Sssss-so ...Bebe ...didn't become smart and cool? It was just her boobs?	['boobs']
Bebe	1	0	Yes!	[]
Cartman	11	0	So, Bebe is actually just as lame as she ever was?	[]
Bebe	7	1	Right. My boobs just clouded your judgment.	['boobs']
Kyle	15	0	But that sucks. I don't want something to have that much power over me.	[]
Stan	23	0	I don't think it will, you guys, as long as we realize it. We must learn to control their power over us.	[]
Clyde	6	1	Yeah. Screw boobs! They're stupid!	['boobs']
Craig	7	0	I'm sorry for fighting, you guys.	[]
Mr. Mackey	7	0	Aw, that's so sweet, m'kay?	[]
Clyde	9	1	Let's never let boobs come between us again!	['boobs']
The Boys	2	0	Hear Hear!	[]
Kyle	3	1	Boobs are stupid!	['boobs']
Wendy	2	0	Hi, everybody.	[]
Clyde	5	0	Look at those ridiculous things!	[]
Butters	7	0	Oooo, they're all hard and oogey!	[]
Cartman	4	1	What a stupid bitch!	['bitch']
