Mr. Garrison	2	0	No-o!	[]
Cartman	26	1	Why the hell does the FBI keep arresting all my friends? This has to be the work of Stan and Kyle! God, I hate those guys!	['hell']
Kyle	28	0	See? I told you, dude. Those are dialysis machines.  Old people have to hook themselves into it with a tube, and it sucks all their body fluids out.	[]

Cartman	21	1	No! I mean, what the hell are you doing?! Why are all my mature adult friends being mys-teriously arrested, huh?!	['hell']
Stan	4	0	We don't know.	[]
Cartman	30	0	I'll tell you why! Because you guys are jealous and can't handle the fact that you're immature, and so you've started a government conspiracy against me!	[]
Kyle	10	1	We don't know what you're talking about, lardbutt.	['lardbutt']
Cartman	16	0	Lardbut. Oh, that's so mature! Golly, I guess I was wrong about you guys, huh?!	[]
Stan	8	0	You're not more mature than us, Cartman!	[]
Cartman	3	0	YES I AM!!	[]
Mr. Garrison	12	0	I'm telling you, this is all a terrible mistake, Officer Barbrady.	[]
Officer Barbrady	21	0	Well, the FBI said I have to hold you here, so that's what I'm gonna do, Mr. Complainy Pants.	[]
Mr. Garrison	2	0	O-ogh!	[]
Tony	7	0	Do you like having your back rubbed?	[]
Mr. Garrison	3	0	Eat me, pervert!	[]
Tony	1	0	Okay.	[]
Man	8	0	We demand you release these men at once!	[]
Officer Barbrady	3	0	Who are you?	[]
Man	20	0	We are NAMBLA, the North American Man Boy Love Association, and we heard about these political prisoners you're keeping?	[]
Officer Barbrady	7	1	Political prisoners? No, these are child molesters.	['molesters']
Man	40	1	Loving young boys has been around since the time of the Romans, pal! There's nothing wrong with it! We are an organization dedicated to showing that sex between a man and a young boy can be a beautiful thing!	['sex']

Other NAMBLA Men	4	0	Hate mongerer! Hate mongerer!	[]
Officer Barbrady	15	0	Okay people , I think you'd better move along before I arrest more of you!	[]
Man	16	0	All these men wanted was to love a young boy!  There is nothing wrong with love!	[]
Mr. Garrison	30	1	I did not want love from a young boy! I like men my own age.  Aah! I mean, I like women! What did I say?-Oh God! I love titties!	['titties']
Man	16	0	You haven't heard the last of us, officer! Together we are strong.  Come on, men!	[]
Officer Barbrady	9	0	Wow, they've got activists for everything these days.	[]
Dr. Mephesto	58	0	I've done it, Kevin. I've successfully spliced this chipmunk with a piece of provolone cheese.  Do you know what this means, Kevin? No more will the world have to look in two different places for squirrels and provolone cheese. No more will mankind have to pick-  Who could that be?  Why, it's little Eric Cartman.	[]
Cartman	5	0	Dr. Mephesto, I need help.	[]
Dr. Mephesto	5	0	Well of course, come in.	[]
Cartman	38	0	You see, unfortunately I have matured faster than all my friends. I wanna hang out with older friends, but I can't find any, so I was wondering if you could genetically engineer some older friends for me.	[]
Dr. Mephesto	25	0	Oh, Eric, I'm afraid it's not that simple. Genetic engineering has not yet evolved to the state where I can just make people.	[]
Cartman	9	1	Damnit! But I wanna hang out with older guys!	['damnit']
Dr. Mephesto	19	0	Oh. Well, I happen to be a member of an organization that can help you. It's called, NAMBLA.	[]

Dr. Mephesto	1	0	Sure!	[]
Man	39	1	Fellow members of NAMBLA. As you know, hn hn, we continue to be discriminated against. Recently, the FBI has started to arrest men, who are doing nothing more than trying to start a sexual relationship with a young boy.	['sexual']

NAMBLA leader	20	1	And now that all ethnic groups, homosexuals and women's are protected under civil-rights laws,  we want the same!	['homosexuals']
Members	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Eager Man	3	0	Yeh-hehah-hah.	[]
NAMBLA leader	43	0	What we need is proof that young boys want to be members of NAMBLA. That they want love from us. We need a poster child, to show the world that it is a beautiful and wonderful thing and a-  Can we... help you?	[]
Cartman	12	0	Yes. I'd like to join your fine organization. Is that cool?	[]
NAMBLA leader	2	0	You... do?	[]

Stuart	8	0	And he fixed my shattered left testicle, too!	[]
Mrs. McCormick	17	0	Don't be out too late, Kenny. We need to start movin' stuff out of your room.	[]
Kyle	6	0	Wow. Your mom's pregnant, Kenny.	[]

Kyle	6	0	What are you talking about, fatass?	[]
Cartman	62	0	Oh, no big deal. I just found a group called NAMBLA with adult members, and they all think that I'm sure mature they want me to be their new poster child is all.  It looks like I'm finally gonna have mature friends who I can relate to. Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! I'm too mature for you guys! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah!	[]
Pharmacist	6	0	Can I help you, young lady?	[]
Kenny	9	0	(Yes. I'm looking for some morning-after abortion-)	[]
Pharmacist	14	0	Oh, you want some morning-after abortion pills. Well, they're right over there.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Thanks.)	[]
Pharmacist	26	0	Uh, I'm sorry, young lady, but I can't sell that to you without permission from your parents.  Oh, well, alrighty then. Cash or charge?	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Cash.)	[]
Kenny	8	0	(Look, Mom. I just fixed you a drink.)	[]
Mrs. McCormick	16	0	Oh, well that's very sweet of you, Kenny. You made my favorite drink for me.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(Here.)	[]
Mrs. McCormick	11	0	But unfortunately, now that I'm pregnant, I can't drink.	[]
Kenny	1	0	(What?)	[]
Stuart	5	0	Well, I can still drink.	[]
Kenny	2	0	(No! Daddy!)	[]
Stuart	33	1	Ogh, that hits the spot. Makes me forget all about my shattered balls.  What? Wwhat's the matter? Uh, why don't you go make me another one of... of...  Who-o-oa.	['balls']

Stuart	10	0	Are you sure you should be going on this thing?	[]
Mrs. McCormick	32	0	Oh, it's all right.  You know, I think maybe Kenny's been a little worried about the new baby. We have to show him that he's still our little boy.	[]
Operator	40	0	Folks, please keep your hands and arms inside the John Denver Experience at all times. There's no sense in trying to unloop at the latch at any time during the ride here at the John Denver Experience. Have fun.	[]

Stuart	10	0	Oh, God, my nose! I think I broke my nose!	[]

Butters	32	1	Huh-you mean to expect me to go out there and let all those... huhu-horny old men... have their way with my fragile person?? Well just what team is this anyway?!	['horny']
Cartman	9	0	Just go, Butters. We're running out of time.	[]
Butters	5	0	Well uuh-uuh-alright then.	[]
Cartman	8	1	Heh, he's such a dumba-a-ass.	['ass']
Butters	16	0	Well, alright men. Here, here I come.  I'm ready to take one for the team.	[]
Stuart	9	0	Kenny?! Kenny, I've had enough of your shenanigans!	[]
NAMBLA Leader	8	0	Oh, one of the boys just came in.	[]
Stuart	8	0	What the-? No, wait, no, WAH, NO, WAAAAAH!	[]
Mrs. McCormick	4	0	Are you alright, Stuart?	[]
Stuart	38	2	Don't touch me! I've had my nuts broken, body poisoned, have been made love to in the ass by three dozen 40-year-old men-I just wanna go home and take a, a hot bath!	['nuts', 'ass']
Lead Agent	15	0	We've been after you for a long time, buddy! Do you know your rights?	[]
NAMBLA Leader	89	0	Rights? Does anybody know their rights? You see, I've learned something today.  Our forefathers came to this country because... they believed in an idea. An idea called freedom. They wanted to live in a place where a group couldn't be prosecuted for their beliefs. Where a person can live the way he chooses to live.  You see us as being perverted because we're different from you. People are afraid of us, because they don't understand. And sometimes it's easier to persecute than to understand.	[]
Kyle	6	1	Dude. You have sex with children.	['sex']
NAMBLA Leader	49	0	We are human. Most of us didn't even choose to be attracted to young boys. We were born that way. We can't help the way we are, and if you all can't understand that, well, then, I guess you'll just have to put us away.	[]
Kyle	6	1	Dude. You have sex with children.	['sex']
Stan	20	2	Yeah. You know, we believe in equality for everybody, and tolerance, and all that gay stuff, but dude, fuck you.	['gay', 'fuck']
Kyle	1	0	Seriously.	[]
Lead Agent	16	0	Alright, that's enough. You're all going to be put away for a long time.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Well, Cartman	[]
Cartman	2	0	Well, what?	[]
Kyle	13	0	Don't you think you owe everyone an apology for bringing NAMBLA here?	[]
The Boys	1	0	Yeah!	[]
Cartman	13	1	Alright, alright, I'm sorry I almost got you guys all raped. There.	['raped']
Stan	16	0	And now, do you still think that you need to hang out with older, mature friends?	[]
Cartman	16	0	No, I guess you guys will blossom into maturity someday. Just don't take too long.	[]
Paramedic	4	0	Okay, let's roll.	[]
Nurse	4	0	Dr. Flores, dial 18-	[]
Stuart	6	0	Coo, cootchy-coo, coohoohoohoo, cootchy-coo.	[]
Mrs. McCormick	4	0	Our little angel, yes.	[]
Stuart	28	0	Oh, he's so beautiful. I know it's been hard on both of us losing poor Kenny. But this new baby kind of reminds me of him.	[]
Mrs. McCormick	5	0	What should we name him?	[]
Stuart	14	0	Well, seeing as though Kenny passed away, maybe we should name him ah,... Kenny.	[]
Mrs. McCormick	19	0	Yes. Kenny's such a great name. My little Kenny, a brand-new Kenny. (The new Kenny then mumbles)	[]
Stuart	10	0	God, this must be the fiftieth time this has happened.	[]
Mrs. McCormick	2	0	Fifty-second.	[]
