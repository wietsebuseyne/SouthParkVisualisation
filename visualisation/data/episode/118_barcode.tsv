Stan	12	0	Hey, check it out, dude. Somebody bought the Donovan's old house.	[]
Kyle	17	0	Yeah, I think they already moved in. I saw moving vans in their driveway two days ago.	[]
Cartman	14	0	I hope they're not Austrians. That's the last thing this town needs.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Hey Look!	[]
Blanket	1	0	Hello!	[]
Kyle	5	0	Hey. Do you live here?	[]
Blanket	15	0	Yeah, I just moved here with my dad. Are you gonna be my new friends?	[]
Cartman	1	0	No.	[]
Blanket	37	0	I really like your town. My dad wanted to move somewhere to get away from it all. He said he wanted peace and quiet, and to live with a bunch of hicks who don't know anything.	[]
Stan	6	0	What's that you're wearing?	[]
Blanket	20	0	It's my mask. My daddy says it's best for me to hide my face. My name's Blanket.	[]
Cartman	38	0	Your name is Blanket... Right. Well Blanket, I'm Howdy Doody, and these are my friends, Timsy, Winky, and Nod. Unfortunately, we have to be off to the Land of Booger Trees, so we'll be leaving now.	[]
Blanket	10	0	Wait! Don't you guys wanna come inside and play?	[]
Cartman	37	0	Huh? Look dude, we're in the fourth grade, okay? You know what that means? It means we don't hang out with a little kid. Come on guys, let's get back to our Big Wheels.	[]
Blanket	5	0	We have arcade games inside.	[]
Blanket	1	0	Dad?	[]
Stan	4	0	Whoa. Dude, no way!	[]
Cartman	6	0	Oh my God, this is awesome!	[]
Stan	6	0	Dude, are these all your toys?	[]
Blanket	14	0	No, this is all my dad's stuff. He loves toys and video games.	[]
Kyle	9	0	Dude, he must be loaded! What does he do?	[]
Blanket	4	0	He's retired now.	[]
Cartman	14	0	Oh my God, dude! Your dad must be the coolest guy in the world!	[]
Blanket	10	0	Come on, my dad's probably out in the backyard.	[]
Cartman	11	1	Oh, kick ass! Dude, why isn't my house like this?!	['ass']
Blanket	4	0	Dad? You out here?	[]
Michael	13	0	Here I am, Blanket!  Heeee!  Jeh chabee durtah!  Blanket! Oh my beautiful blanket!	[]
Kyle	6	0	What's wrong with his face?	[]
Stan	14	0	Be cool, dude. I, I think maybe he's a burn victim or something.	[]
Blanket	7	0	Guys, this is my dad. Michael Ja-	[]
Michael	69	0	Jefferson! Michael ...Jefferson, yeh. Hey, you wanna play with me?  Come on, let's climb the tree!  Come on, climb the tree, climb the tree!  Have you been up my... Wishing Tree? Tuh! It's where I come to think and dream. And now I'd like to show you my... Wishing Tree.  Jam on! Where we can laugh and giggle and scream.  Hee hee! Imagination is the key.	[]
Kyle	8	0	Mr. Jefferson, your son can't get up.	[]
Michael	7	0	Won't you imagine along with me?	[]
Kyle	2	0	Mr. Jefferson?	[]
Michael	28	0	We can be spacemen,  or pirates on the sea Chuckajamonah! Yes we can do everything, and I mean, everything! Chuckajamonah! Up in my Wishing Tree! Hee hee! Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh!	[]
Stan	14	0	Hey, you guys! You guys!  You gotta come with us over to the Jeffersons!	[]
Red	2	0	The Jeffersons?	[]
Cartman	26	0	They're a new family that just moved to South Park! We met this kid named Blanket and he has the coolest dad in the world!	[]
Kyle	18	0	Mr. Jefferson said we can invite all the kids in town to go play over at their house.	[]
Cartman	30	0	They have like, video games and rides and a cotton-candy machine, oh, and, and in their back yard, guess what they have in their back yard?! Guess. A train.	[]
Craig	2	0	No way.	[]
Cartman	18	0	Yeah way, Craig! And if you don't believe in Mr. Jefferson, then you can just not come!	[]
Craig	5	0	I believe in Mr. Jefferson!	[]
Michael	10	0	Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, look at us on the swing! We're swinging!	[]
Blanket	6	0	Who wants the first cotton candy?	[]
Kids	1	0	Memememememememememe...	[]
Michael	16	0	Mememe! I'm first! I'm first!  Oooo, let's go ride the choo-choo train!	[]
Cartman	4	0	Choo-choo train! Yay!	[]
Michael	21	0	Let's ride the train! The train!  Would you like to ride the train with me, and start a magical journey?	[]
Cartman	11	0	Yes I would, Mr. Jefferson. You're so awesome, Mr. Jefferson.	[]
Michael	6	0	Cartman, you have a beautiful voice.	[]
Cartman	7	0	Thank you Mr. Jefferson. So do you.	[]
Michael	9	0	Let's ride and ride on the train together	[]
Cartman	2	0	...Train together	[]
Michael	8	0	On a journey through both of our minds.	[]
Cartman	6	0	...I've got time. Do youuu??	[]
Kyle	6	0	Dude, what happened to your knee?	[]
Blanket	3	0	I fell down.	[]
Kyle	2	0	Mr. Jefferson!	[]
Michael	9	0	Choo-choo train, it's all fun and games.	[]
Cartman	3	0	Choo-choo train.	[]
Kyle	11	1	Mr- ! Goddammit. Here, come on. We need to clean that up.	['goddammit']
Kyle	8	0	Alright, this is gonna sting for a second.	[]
Blanket	1	0	Ow!	[]
Kyle	6	0	I know, I know. Be cool.	[]
Blanket	6	0	Thank you. That already feels better.	[]
Kyle	9	0	So, dude, do you have any brothers or sisters?	[]
Blanket	16	0	I have a half-brother and a half-sister. But they live with their mom now.	[]
Kyle	5	0	And where is your mom?	[]
Blanket	6	0	I don't have a mom.	[]
Kyle	18	0	You must have a mom.  You mean she doesn't live here, or she's dead, or what?	[]
Blanket	7	0	No. I was made in a laboratory.	[]
Kyle	1	0	What?	[]
Blanket	33	0	My daddy wanted to have a baby, so he put me in a test tube. Then, they put me in a woman's tummy, and, when I was born, Daddy took me home.	[]
Kyle	6	0	So you never met your mom?	[]
Blanket	15	0	No... But I used to have a lot of bodyguards and nannies, if that counts.	[]
Kyle	4	0	Yeah. Yeah, that counts.	[]
Cartman	42	0	Oh man, that was great! You guys know what Mr. Jefferson said? He said I'm his best friend, and I can go over to his house whenever I want! I'm supposed to go right back over there after dinner tonight!	[]
Kyle	9	0	You guys, I feel kinda bad for that kid.	[]
Cartman	12	0	You feel bad for him?! He has everything a kid could want!	[]
Kyle	14	0	Mr. Jefferson just seems like he wants to be a kid, not have one.	[]
Cartman	73	2	Oh, you know what?! This makes perfect sense! A guy moves into South Park with a FERRIS wheel in his back yard, and KYLE has to see a problem with it!  Mr. Jefferson is the best thing that's happened to this town in a long time, and if you miss this up, so help me god, I will rip your balls off with my bare hands! With my bare hands, Goddamn you!	['balls', 'goddamn']
Randy	10	0	Well, there he is. Where have you been all afternoon.	[]
Stan	9	0	I was over at the new neighbors, the Jeffersons.	[]
Sharon	5	0	Oh, are they nice people?	[]
Stan	9	0	Yeah. It's just a dad and his son.	[]
Sharon	22	0	Well, we're supposed to have the Broflovskis and the Stotches over for dinner tonight. Maybe I'll invite Mr. Jefferson too.	[]
Gerald	13	0	So, Mr. Jefferson, did I hear you say you moved here from Kentucky?	[]
Michael	2	0	Kentucky, yeah.	[]
Randy	9	0	I heard people saying you all were from Illinois.	[]
Michael	8	0	No, the- they're ignorant. That's ignorant.	[]
Stephen	9	0	What kind of work do you do, Mr. Jefferson?	[]
Michael	10	0	Oh I'm retired now, but, I was in... pharmaceuticals	[]
Sheila	19	0	Well our boys have really taken a liking to you. You seem to really have a way with them.	[]
Michael	23	0	I just id- identify so much with children. Their innocence, their beauty. I think that God is in the face of every child.	[]
Randy	1	0	....Yeeeah.	[]
Sharon	8	0	...They are fun.  Boys, you okay out there?	[]
Stan	2	0	Fine, Mom.	[]
Blanket	9	0	Wow, these are great. What are they called again?	[]
Kyle	16	0	They're TV dinners. Don't you wanna take that veil off so you can eat?	[]
Blanket	15	0	Nah, I'm not supposed to. Dad says I have to keep my face hidden.	[]
Cartman	14	1	What the hell is going on?! Are you having Mr. Jefferson over for dinner?!	['hell']
Stan	4	0	No, my parents are.	[]
Cartman	11	0	You guys better not be trying to Bogart my friend away!	[]
Stan	1	0	What?	[]
Cartman	37	1	He is my friend, got it?! I was friends with him before you assholes were,  and I hoowi-  Stan! Stan, I'm seriously! You'd better not be talking bad about me in there to Mr. Jefferson!	['assholes']
Gerald	10	0	Hey, you know Kobe Bryant was up in Eagle today.	[]
Randy	16	0	Oh yeah? What do you think, Mr. Jefferson? Do you think Kobe's guilty or innocent?	[]
Michael	2	0	D'huh?	[]
Stephen	17	0	I think he's definitely going to jail. I just love seeing smug celebrities get their comeuppance.	[]
Michael	13	0	I think it's wrong what the police do to wealthy black men.	[]
Gerald	27	0	Oh come on, Mr. Jefferson, you're not one of those who think that the police go around framing rich black people just because they're jealous?	[]
Michael	16	0	Yeah! Because their hearts are full of greed and they have... doo-doo in their souls.	[]
Harris	7	0	Hey Sergeant, take a look at this.	[]
Yates	2	0	Whatcha got?	[]
Harris	31	0	Looks like a new family has just moved into South Park. One Mr. Jefferson, age 50, bought a house there and paid cash. He seems to have a lot of money.	[]
Yates	5	0	So, what's the problem?	[]
Harris	8	0	Take a look. Says here...  He's black.	[]
Yates	48	0	By God, so he is. Black and rich. Time to take this Mr. Jefferson down, just like we did Kobe.  Let's go people!  We've got another rich black guy. I want him humiliated and dragged through the dirt, and I want it done by the books!	[]
Stan	1	0	Kyle?	[]
Michael	4	0	Hey, Stan, whatcha doin'?	[]
Stan	10	0	Mr. Jefferson- Awww!  It's 1:30 in the morning!	[]
Michael	16	0	Look at me, I'm Peter Pan.  T-shamon!  I'm a little boy forever.  Hey!	[]
Stan	9	0	Mr. Jefferson, I have to go to school tomorrow!	[]
Cartman	31	2	Oh, son of a bitch! I knew it! What the hell are you doing, Stan?! I'll tell you what you're doing! You're trying to steal MY best friend!	['bitch', 'hell']
Stan	5	0	He just showed up here.	[]
Cartman	9	0	Remember, Mr. Jefferson? You said we were best friends.	[]
Stan	2	0	Jesus Christ!	[]
Kyle	11	0	Dude, look who I found prowling around in my back yard.	[]
Blanket	2	0	Hi, Stan.	[]
Kyle	17	0	He was out all alone in the middle of the night. Mr. Jefferson isn't even home.	[]
Stan	5	0	I know. He's here.	[]
Kyle	1	0	What?!	[]
Michael	9	0	Oh Kyle, Blanket, yay, it's a slumber party!	[]
Stan	10	0	No! Mr. Jefferson, you need to take your son home.	[]
Michael	17	0	We can't go home. There's a ghost in our house. Me and Blanket are scared.	[]
Blanket	7	0	Dad says it wants to eat us.	[]
Michael	15	0	Please don't make us go back home. Please! We're scared, we're scared!	[]
Blanket	3	0	We're scared!	[]
Mr. Jefferson	2	0	Hee hee!	[]
Stan	14	0	Okay, fine, we'll all stay here, but we're going to sleep now!	[]
Kyle	3	0	Come on, Blanket.	[]
Michael	23	0	Now let's all sleep and dream Heehee! of fun and adventurous things shamonah! It's time for us all to say goodnight	[]
Cartman	16	0	Deeper.  Mr. Jefferson, I wish I could be around you all the time. You're awesome.	[]
Michael	7	0	I think you're awesome too, Cartman.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Yeah?	[]
Michael	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Yeah?	[]
Michael	1	0	Yeah.	[]
Cartman	1	0	Yeah?	[]
Stan	1	0	Haaa!	[]
Michael	11	0	What's the matter, Stan? Did you have a bad dream?	[]
Stan	7	0	Yeah. A really bad dream.  Oh Jesus!	[]
Yates	3	0	Murphy, you inside?	[]
Murphy	29	2	We're inside, sir. Harris was right. This guy looks like he has more money than all of us put together. Black sonofabitch!  I'm planting the cocaine now.	['sonofabitch', 'cocaine']
Yates	4	0	Johnson, what about you?	[]
Johnson	6	0	Placing the blood spatter now, sir.	[]
Yates	1	0	Frakes?	[]
Frakes	9	1	Placing pubic hair from the raped girl now, sir.	['raped']
Yates	30	0	All right, when this Jefferson guy shows up, arrest him fast and try not to beat him. There could be neighbors with video cameras.  Why do we do it, Harris?	[]
Harris	1	0	Sir?	[]
Yates	24	0	Why is it that us policemen around the country have such a passion for framing wealthy African-Americans with crimes they didn't commit?	[]
Harris	14	0	Oh, why? I guess I never thought about why, sir. We just do it.	[]
Yates	79	0	Twenty-five years I've been on the force. I've seen every kind of sick, depraved act known to humanity and still, when I see a black man walk by who has more money than me, I... want to vomit my gizzards right in the gutter. But why? Maybe there is no reason. Maybe there's just a big blue ball out there that's mostly covered with water and we're just goin' along for the ride.	[]
Randy	12	0	Stan, time to get up for school.  Stan? What the-?  Mr. Jefferson?!	[]
Michael	9	0	Oh oh, we were just having a slumber party.	[]
Randy	6	0	Mr. Jefferson, this is highly inappropriate!	[]
Michael	40	0	Inappropriate? No, you're being ignorant. They're my friends. You see, I- I didn't have a childhood, so I'm really just a child myself.  Here, everything's okay. I want you each to have a hundred dollars.	[]
Randy	14	0	Wow, I'm gonna go buy that new sport coat I've been wanting.	[]
Michael	14	0	Come on, Blanket. We have to go home and feed the animals. Bye, friends.	[]
Sharon	16	0	Boys, I do not want you going over to Mr. Jefferson's anymore. Do you understand?	[]
Stan	14	1	You don't have to tell us twice, Mom. That guy's a freak!	['freak']
Cartman	21	2	Not go to Mr. Jefferson's anymore? Well, excuse my French, Mrs. Marsh, but you can suck my fat, hairy balls!	['fat', 'balls']
Michael	3	0	Come on, Blanket!	[]
Yates	5	0	Hey Har- Har- Harris! Harris!	[]
Harris	3	0	Wha- wha- what?	[]
Yates	62	1	It's Jefferson! He's back!  All right, people. Let's give Blacky a nice welcome home.  Whoa, wait a minute!  That guy isn't black!  Holy God, his son isn't black either! Oh Jesus!  This is Yates! Stand down! I repeat, stand down! Suspect is not black!  You son of a bitch, you told my this guy was African-American!	['bitch']
Harris	10	0	It says right here on the final sheet he is!	[]
Yates	9	0	Does that look like a black guy to you?!	[]
Harris	6	0	It said on the final sheet!	[]
Yates	41	1	Jesus Christ Monkeyballs! We could have made an innocent man go to jail who wasn't black! Oh!  Wuuugh! Wuugh! Ohaugh. Ugh.  Jesus, Harris. What are we becoming? We're supposed to... protect the people. Where have we lost our way?	['monkeyballs']
Harris	15	0	Sir, it's possible that he is black, even though he doesn't look it.	[]
Yates	21	1	To hell with you! I'm never gonna frame an innocent man again! Unless I know he's black for sure!	['hell']
Michael	25	0	All the adults are trying to get us. Get up to your room, Blanket, and put your mask on! We can't go outside anymore!	[]
Kyle	3	0	That poor kid.	[]
Stan	11	0	Dude, come on. We're not supposed to go over there.	[]
Blanket	2	0	Hi guys!	[]
Kyle	18	0	Hey Blanket. Uh, look, we're goin' over to help my dad chop wood. You... wanna come with?	[]
Blanket	4	0	Really? You mean it?	[]
Michael	11	0	Oh yay, my friends are here! Come inside and play, guys!	[]
Stan	15	0	Ah, actually, Mr. Jefferson, we were seeing if Blanket wanted to chop wood with us.	[]
Michael	15	0	Chop wood? No, that's ignorant. That's poopie work. Blanket and me wanna play!	[]
Stan	15	0	Mr. Jefferson, uh, it might be good for Blanket to learn how to chop wood.	[]
Michael	13	0	Blanket likes to play, don't you Blanket?  Wee, look! He can fly!	[]
Kyle	3	0	Jesus Christ, dude!	[]
Blanket	1	0	Aaaaaah!	[]
Stan	4	1	Stop, you fucking lunatic!	['fucking']
Kyle	11	0	Dude, we have got to get that kid away from him!	[]
Michael	38	0	No, Blanket, shhhh. Stop crying. It's okay, Blanket. Here, look.  Jeekabee durtah!  Ow!  There, Blanket, shhhh.  Hey, hey look, hey look.  I got your nose.  Look! Lookit, I got your nose. I got your nose, Blanket. See?	[]
Blanket	1	0	Aaaaaaaah!	[]
Michael	10	0	No, Blanket, stop!  It's ignorant. You're being ignorant!	[]
Maggie	11	0	Harrison, why haven't you called? You know how I worry.	[]
Yates	10	0	I'm givin' up, Maggie. I'm quitting the force.	[]
Maggie	4	0	Quitting the force? You?	[]
Yates	141	2	None of it makes sense anymore.  I don't even know if what we're doing is right. The last thirteen hours we've been working on a case, trying to get a real scumbag off the streets. And when he walked up to the door, I could have sworn he was white. Maybe I can't tell the difference anymore. Maybe it doesn't matter. Because it seems like every time we frame a rich black guy, he's back out on the streets in no time. It's just like OJ. Do you know how hard those cops worked to frame him? The tireless hours they put in?! And then he just gets off because somebody messed up and said the N word out loud too many times. I guess I'm just tired. I'm just damn tired.	['scumbag', 'damn']
Maggie	95	0	Not another word of that kind of talk, Harrison Yates.  Believe me I would love nothin' more than to have you quit the force and no longer have to worry about whether or not you're comin' home. But I know you. Framin' rich black men for crimes they didn't commit is in your blood. Wiping that rich, smug smile off their faces is the only thing that puts a smile on yours. You're a good cop, Harrison Yates. You don't have to question that. Because I'm here to tell you.	[]
Yates	15	0	And you're a good wife, Maggie. You know me better than I know myself.	[]
Maggie	4	0	Where're you goin'?	[]
Yates	10	0	Think I've got a little more work to do.	[]
Cartman	23	0	Mr. Jefferson? It's your best friend in the whole wide world, Eric Cartman. Mr. Jefferson? I came to sleep over tonight, remember?	[]
Michael	58	0	No, Dr. Nelson, I'm telling you, you have to fly out here right now! My nose came off again!  I know you live in California; I'll pay for your plane ticket!  But I'm falling apart! I need some more of that cream and the injections! I have to look young again!  Oh, I'm melting!	[]
Kyle	9	0	All right. Thanks a lot for helping us, dude.	[]
Kenny	3	0	Yeah, sure, whatever.	[]
Stan	16	0	You just gotta pretend you're Blanket until we can get the real Blanket somewhere safe.	[]
Kenny	8	0	Aren't I too big to be Blanket?	[]
Kyle	16	0	I don't think Mr. Jefferson pays enough attention to his son to notice. Come on!	[]
Stan	4	0	Blanket, you in here?	[]
Blanket	2	0	Hi guys!	[]
Kyle	13	0	Shh, Blanket, we're gonna take you away for a little while, okay?	[]
Blanket	9	0	You are? Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!	[]
Stan	7	0	All right dude, get in his bed.	[]
Kenny	9	0	All right, but you guys owe me for this.	[]
Stan	10	0	Dude, whatever. At least you finally get to do something.	[]
Snetzl	7	0	Santa Barbara Police Department, this is Snetzl.	[]
Yates	14	0	Hello, this is Sergeant Yates over at the Park County Police Department in Colorado.	[]
Snetzl	8	0	Yes, sergeant. What can I do for you?	[]
Yates	29	0	Well, we've been trying to frame this guy who just moved into our town, and the fil-o-fax says he moved from your area. One Martin Jefferson?	[]
Snetzl	22	0	Hm. No, we never had a any rich African-Americans named Jefferson here. If we had, we would have framed him ourselves.	[]
Yates	8	0	Well, he doesn't really look that black.	[]
Snetzl	33	1	Yeah, I don't, uh... Hold on a second. There was one we framed a couple of times, but the black bastard was so rich he made bail and disappeared before the trial.	['bastard']
Yates	10	0	You say he disappeared? What did you frame him for?	[]
Snetzl	25	1	We, uhhh, found some kids that had stayed over at his place, and we asked them to lie and make up some false molestation charges.	['molestation']
Yates	2	1	Molestation, nice.	['molestation']
Snetzl	48	1	Yeah, it was a lot of work. Took years, but we were finally able to arrest him. Then we planted some evidence, took embarassing photos of his penis, and threw him in a dirty prison cell with doodie feces on the walls. You should have seen him squirm!	['penis']
Yates	9	2	That's damn fine police work, sergeant. Damn fine.	['damn', 'damn']
Snetzl	31	0	Heh, yeah, but the point is this guy didn't really look black either. We had to sneak in while he was asleep and get a DNA sample to be sure.	[]
Yates	9	1	Jesus Christ Monkeyballs! It must be the same guy!	['monkeyballs']
Cartman	3	0	Mr. Jefferson, hello?!	[]
Kyle	11	0	Come on, Blanket! We gotta go before your dad sees us.	[]
Michael	16	0	What are you doing with my Blanket?  Come on, Blanket, play with me. Jeechabee durtah! Hee!	[]
"Stan, Kyle, Blanket"	1	0	Haaaaa!	[]
Stan	3	0	Go, go, ruuun!	[]
Mr. Jefferson	1	0	Sutah!	[]
"Stan, Kyle, Blanket"	1	0	Haaaaa!	[]
Michael	3	0	Wuchatennah! Jamonah! Heehee!	[]
Stan	2	0	Oh Jesus!	[]
Kenny	8	1	What the hell is going on, you guys?	['hell']
Michael	6	0	My Blanket! Let's play, Blanket!	[]
Kenny	6	0	Nonono wait, I'm not Blanket!	[]
Michael	7	0	Wee, he can fly! He can fly!	[]
Kenny	4	0	Aaaah! Aaaah, stop! A-	[]
Stan	6	0	Oh my God, they killed Kenny!	[]
Kyle	2	1	You bastard!	['bastard']
Michael	4	0	Blanket? Blanket! Come play!	[]
Blanket	1	0	Nooo!	[]
Kyle	2	0	Come on!	[]
Stan	3	0	Run, Blanket, Run!	[]
Blanket	1	0	Ah!	[]
Michael	3	0	Dainduh! Dainduh Dainduh!	[]
Kyle	3	0	Hang on, Blanket!	[]
Mr. Jefferson	3	0	Dugh! Heehee! Ja-!	[]
Yates	14	0	Freeze, Jefferson! The gig is up! You are wanted for child mo-les-tation!	[]
Cartman	39	1	No! I am sick and tired of people harassing Mr. Jefferson!  All I've been hearing since Mr. Jefferson moved here are sick lies! That he molests children, that he's a bad father, that he has plastic surgery!	['molests']
Michael	3	0	It's ignorant.	[]
Cartman	43	0	Sure, maybe Mr. Jefferson's a little different. But that's because he had to work all the time when he was young and missed out on his childhood. What's wrong with wanting to have the innocence and beauty of a child.	[]
Kyle	89	0	All right, let's just say all the bad things said about Mr. Jefferson are lies! Let's say the police department does just go around spending their time framing people for crimes they didn't commit!  Let's say it's all made up, and Mr. Jefferson is just a nice guy who's trying to be a child because he never got to have a childhood. Well that's fine, except for that he HAS children now! And when people have children, they have to grow up!	[]
Michael	70	0	You're right. I've been so obsessed with my childhood that I've forgotten about his. I thought having lots of rides and toys was enough, but... Blanket doesn't need a playmate. He needs a father, and a normal life. Chickuckoo gainuh.  Blanket, I wanna give away all my money. I- I wanna get a normal job and... take a shot at raising you in a normal setting.	[]
Blanket	8	0	Look everybody! I'm a normal little boy.	[]
Yates	29	0	Well, if you're gonna give away all your money, then, I guess we can drop all those charges. No point in putting another poor black man in jail.	[]
Kyle	7	0	All right! Things just might work out!	[]
Michael	80	1	Things can always work out, as long as we know we have the power to change. We all have the power to change if we search inside our hearts' And we start to heal the wounds of all our yesterdays And you know it might be hard, but all you've got to do is start, And you can change all of your evil molesting ways. Jejabee durtah! Hee-hee! OOOOH! Jejabee durtah! Hee-hee! Jamonah! butcha-tamonah! Chich-cha!	['molesting']
